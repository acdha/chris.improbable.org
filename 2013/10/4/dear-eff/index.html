                    <p>
                        First, some background: I've been a supporter and donor to the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> for a long time – at least 2001, although I believe I started earlier during the <a href="http://wiki.openrightsgroup.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">90s Crypto Wars</a> – and opposed to to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a> for at least as long. I've also been a fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_O%27Brien">Danny O'Brien</a>'s reporting and personal blog for a similarly long time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, today had me reconsidering that support because of O'Brien's recent blog post: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/lowering-your-standards">Lowering Your Standards: DRM and the Future of the W3C</a> . I feel this marks a dangerous trend of playing very loose with the facts in an attempt to pressure the W3C to drop the <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html-media/raw-file/tip/encrypted-media/encrypted-media.html">Encrypted Media Extensions (EME)</a> spec and that this is not only like to fail but actually backfire in ensuring that millions of people continue to access content through proprietary, closed systems.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        Background
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        A little background information: most video played on the web and particularly commercial content uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash" title="Adobe Flash - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Adobe's Flash</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight" title="Microsoft Silverlight - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Microsoft's Silverlight</a> plugins to run a video player inside a webpage. Both Flash and Silverlight are full programming environments with a significant range of capabilities beyond video playback and have significant overlap with the features provided by your browser. They're distributed as browser plugins, which require a hefty download to be installed before viewing anything, and both generally require proprietary tools for developers to create applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They're annoying for developers because they require using a completely different set of technologies than you use for everything else on the web but many places will write that off as a cost of doing business. What's more of a concern is that both plugins have a history of security problems and neither Microsoft nor Adobe appear to be particularly motivated to build the kind of fast, reliable, automatic update system which the modern browsers have so in addition to requiring your users to download something before viewing content, you're contributing to one of the leading sources of security exploits for the average user. It also means that anyone who wishes to publish video on the web is generally subject to the development roadmap for one of two companies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HTML5 offers a way out of this mess: browsers could play back video directly, avoiding the massive external dependency and allowing them to make improvements for video as quickly as they do anything else rather than hoping a third-party developer wants to make improvements. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_video">HTML5 &lt;video&gt;</a> is very easy to use, fast and has a consistent high-quality user experience. Unfortunately anyone looking to use it for commercial content will learn that the licensing rules from all of the major content owners require the use of DRM and thus HTML5 video is not an option.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What is EME, anyway?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The W3C's <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html-media/raw-file/tip/encrypted-media/encrypted-media.html">EME</a> group is working on way to reduce this dependency by adding a general mechanism which allows the use of HTML5 video with a little bit of JavaScript to specify a <abbr title="Content Decryption Module">CDM</abbr> and a decryption key for the file. This allows content providers to use the entire modern web stack and limit the DRM dependency to a small chunk of code which handles only the actual decryption – dramatically lowering the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface" title="Attack surface - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">attack surface</a> and avoiding the need for anywhere near as frequent updates as the actual decryption mechanism is far less complex than the entire, largely-duplicative platform which Flash or Silverlight provide.
                    </p>
                    <h3>
                        The problem
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        DRM does not work and all DRMed content has ended up being available in unencrypted form very quickly because the only way to make DRM work is by completely locking down a device to prevent its owner from running code which can access the unencrypted data and, of course, there's always the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_hole" title="Analog hole - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Analog Hole</a>. The EFF has a <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/drm">long, laudable history attempting to educate the public and lawmakers</a> about these issues and I completely support those efforts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, this effort has failed. No significant amount of commercial video on the web is available without DRM and users don't seem to care as the billions of dollars of sales through iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, etc. and Netflix is using somewhere around <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/05/netflix-now-owns-almost-30-percent-of-north-american-fixed-internet-traffic/">30% of the total Internet traffic in North America</a> to serve DRM-encumbered video, mostly using Silverlight. Clearly convenience and availability are more important to people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The EFF has been taking a hard-line position on EME, focused on slippery-slope claims:

                                By approving this idea, the W3C has ceded control of the "user agent" (the term for a Web browser in W3C parlance) to a third-party, the content distributor. That breaks a—perhaps until now unspoken—assurance about who has the final say in your Web experience, and indeed who has ultimate control over your computing device.

It's a Web where user agents—browsers—must navigate a nest of enforced duties every time they visit a page. It's a place where the next Tim Berners-Lee or Mozilla, if they were building a new browser from scratch, couldn't just look up the details of all the "Web" technologies. They'd have to negotiate and sign compliance agreements with a raft of DRM providers just to be fully standards-compliant and interoperable.

                                The first of these conditions – "robustness" against end-user modification – is a blanket ban on all free/open source software (free/open source software, by definition, can be modified by its users). <em>That means that the two most popular browser technologies on the Web – WebKit (used in Chrome and Safari) and Gecko (used in Firefox and related browsers) – would be legally prohibited from implementing whatever "standard" the W3C emerges</em>.

                        Both of these are simply wrong: there is no meaningful distinction between what EME proposes and what is already the case with a browser plugin. If Firefox can play Flash or Silverlight content, it can decrypted video using a CDM which is either included in the host operating system, bundled under an agreement similar to Chrome's Flash plugin or installed by the user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The real problem is that they're arguing the wrong point: those requests have always been made and, in most cases, have already happened. The lack of a W3C standard hasn't prevented the Amazon Kindle app from preventing your ability to save unencrypted text, iTunes from blocking saving snippets of a rented movie, etc. and it hasn't prevented either Adobe or Microsoft from adding every DRM feature requested by the content owners. What this has done is ensured that the web community hasn't had much say in the process because all of the content is created and played using proprietary closed software.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The EFF is shouting loudly but only Adobe and Microsoft will benefit</strong>. There's no indication whatsoever that the studios are going to drop their DRM requirements if this W3C spec is scuttled – we'll just continue to see a lot of opaque plugin content and, of course, more pressure away from the web towards proprietary app stores. Mozilla's Asa Dotzler summed this up perfectly earlier today on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6492027">Hacker News:</a> <q cite="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6492027">[T]he businesses (Hollywood) with the content that Web users want have done that math and decided that DRM through plug-ins and native apps is an EXCELLENT system and they're happy to keep mandating it forever. If Plug-ins go away, as they're slowly but surely doing, then native apps will be the only place to get this content.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This approach also runs the risk of damaging the reputation of the EFF and making it less effective: beyond basic factual problems, exaggerating the risks will backfire badly if people look and – correctly – see that the situation isn't so terrible (Netflix at $10/month is absurdly popular despite the DRM) and discount future claims made by the EFF. They'll need that credibility as the <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html">war on general purpose computing</a> continues — and Cory is not wrong to sound the alarm over that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What the open web community should be doing now is working to ensure that EME is designed in a way which improves security and reduces the proprietary footprint. If the standard for CDMs includes aggressive sandboxing it's a huge win for security alone even if all it does is turn Flash into a collective bad memory for web users. Additionally, separating the task of building a decryption module from building a high-performance video player with robust networking, makes it significantly easier for new vendors to enter the market and increases portability because so much less code needs to be adapted to a new platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are some interesting long-term trends, as well: more education about the risks of DRMed content is good and reducing what consumers are willing to pay for restricted content may be the best long-term strategy. Some of that effort needs to be directed towards content owners and providers who are thinking about investing in complex, expensive systems which don't actually work. A very interesting approach was highlighted by Mozilla's <a href="https://brendaneich.com/">Brendan Eich</a> earlier this year in the form of OTOY's pure-JavaScript video codec which in addition to avoiding all of the issues with binary plugins has first-class support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watermarking" title="Digital watermarking - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">watermarking</a>.
                    </p>
                    <figure class="quote">
                        <blockquote cite="https://brendaneich.com/2013/05/today-i-saw-the-future/">

                                Watermarking, not DRM. This could be huge. OTOY’s GPU cloud approach enables individually watermarking every intra-frame, and according to some of its Hollywood supporters including Ari Emanuel, this may be enough to eliminate the need for DRM.

                        Obviously a shift away from the DRM obsession won't happen overnight but it's not impossible, either, as content owners are concerned about the market leverage which the major DRM vendors like Apple and Amazon have. There's space for smart players willing to back away from DRM in favor of an approach which works at least as well and doesn't require hardware vendors to sell out their users. As Brendan said, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6496128"><q cite="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6496128">there is hope</q></a>.
