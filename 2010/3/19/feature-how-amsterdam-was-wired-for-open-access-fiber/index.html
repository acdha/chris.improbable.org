                            <p>
                                The city of Amsterdam has been involved for several years in building <a href="http://www.citynet.nl/">Citynet</a>, a partnership between the city and two private investors to wire 40,000 Amsterdam buildings with fiber. And it's not just fiber, it's <em>open access</em> fiber—any ISP can sign up to use the infrastructure and deliver ultra-fast Internet access.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 2008, the European Union ruled that the city's involvement in the project was in fact legal, and that it was not improperly interfering in the market.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We asked Herman Wagter, CEO of the company that built the Citynet fiber project, to talk about how he got the job done, and to explain the challenges of rolling out fiber in a densely crowded European city.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Theory versus practice
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                First, a few basic problems.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unlike in the US and Japan, stringing fiber along poles is not an option in European capitals. Every fiber cable must be buried below the pavement, then distributed inside a building to apartments; no wires can be exposed on the outside. The density of these old cities is quite high, and real estate is expensive, leaving little room for cabinets with active equipment on the street level. The majority of the housing consists of multi-dwelling-units (MDUs) with up to 500 individual apartments per building, but one can find the occasional houseboat on a canal as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When the design of the Amsterdam fiber network started in 2005, it became clear that there was little experience in the market with this type of deployment. Contractors were used to either putting copper wires or coax lines in new buildings, or digging long stretches of big high density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes for backhaul purposes. Most fiber packaging was optimized for backhaul and for metro networks; few products were specifically designed for fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) in these conditions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fortunately, most vendors, like Draka, who delivered the fiber in Amsterdam were able to react quickly and rise to the occasion when challenged with specific requirements for the city. The experience in Amsterdam and other European cities has resulted over the years in products like miniature direct burial cables, special high-rise cables with break-out windows to allow very fast builds inside MDUs, fibers that can bend sharply, easy-install Fiber Termination Units (FTUs) inside apartments, and so on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The learning curve for everyone involved was immense. Only now, after five years, is it tapering off, giving everyone a chance to catch their breath. Here's what we learned from the last half-decade of fiber installs in Amsterdam.
                            </p>

                                Architecture

                            <div>
                                <div>

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Deploying buried cables to every apartment in a dense city is a disruptive process. You do not want to repeat it for decades—preferably longer—so it needs to be done right.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A point-to-point fiber topology runs individual fibers from each apartment back to the local aggregation point (think of the phone system model); it's the most flexible and future-proof topology. Point-to-point will support all known technologies (GPON, active Ethernet, lambda, RF video overlay, and others) by patching individual fibers in the aggregation point. It allows for easy unbundling of individual lines, a feature much appreciated by regulators and customers in Europe.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The alternative topology, PON, features a shared fiber for each 32 to 64 customers. This saves on fiber runs and reduces the number of connectors and the size of the local point of presence gear, but it has one big architectural drawback: more path dependencies. Finally, it is difficult to unbundle a PON topology.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The length of fiber needed to cover the distance from a point of presence (called an aggregation point with active equipment, or APOP) to an apartment is a few kilometers at most, so the cost of the actual fiber is only a small part of the total investment (less than 10 percent).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Handling that many fibers in a point-to-point topology may seem like a problem until the comparison is made with the old equivalent: 100-year old copper cabling for the phone system. Those copper cables are much more bulky than the equivalent fiber cables; in fact, they are four times fatter. Yet we have been able to manage a huge number of copper cables for ages without a problem, so a much slimmer fiber plant should not pose a problem, even when every apartment gets its own line.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So we decided to go for point-to-point in Amsterdam: it did (and does) not make sense to be “penny wise and pound foolish,” by saving on fiber upfront but running the risk of having to redo the outside fiber plant in a decade or two. Paying a slightly higher cost (estimated at 5 percent or less of the total CAPEX budget for the project) for more fiber length and more connectors/patches was considered an acceptable insurance premium against potential premature technical obsolescence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (In case of Citynet, a second fiber specifically for RF-video was deployed as well, as a shared fiber with optical splitters. In the next build-outs this will be modified to a second point-to-point fiber, as the limitations of a shared fiber became obvious.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The second decision was to build an open-access, passive fiber plant that would support multiple ISPs in competition. In practice this translates to:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Unbundled dark fiber access lines which can be rented individually by an ISP who wants to serve that particular customer
                                </li>
                                <li>ISPs can get access to APOPs to install their line cards and related equipment, patch in their customer access line, and connect to their own backhaul network
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                To prevent a clutter of patch cords in the APOP, the patching is limited per group of connections (1,500 to 3,000). If an ISP wants to service a customer within the group, it has to place equipment within the group patch area. A group of 1,500 to 3,000 patches to a limited number of ISPs can be de-cluttered within a reasonable amount of time if the need should arise.

                                In a city like Amsterdam, space is a much sought after resource. We need space to erect buildings, public space for roads, bike lanes, car parking, and freely accessible parks with trees. So where could we find space to put a concentration point where all fibers meet and get patched to electronics, with cooling and power supplies and the like?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first idea was to design small cabinets as APOPs for 1,000 customers or less, much like VDSL cabinets, and place them on the street in the public rights of way. Alas, the idea of erecting cabinets that emit heat and sound (fans for cooling) appeared to be a horrifying thought for the authorities. As one of them said, “450 new gathering and sleeping locations for vagrants and junkies? Never!”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In their experience, these kinds of cabinets tend to become a meeting place where waste is discarded and problems get concentrated. Combined with the realization that small APOPs make life very difficult for new entrants who want to take advantage of unbundling (small APOPs require much more redundant backhaul to reach the many boxes) the decision was easy: go for bigger APOPs, and stick them inside buildings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Of course, this meant searching for available space in existing real estate, which had its own challenges, and negotiating contracts with each owner.&nbsp;It turns out you either can get very big APOPs in their own buildings, each concentrating 40,000 to 80,000 connections or more, or you can get “left-over space” in existing buildings, which was the preferred option.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are more cellars, or corners of parking garages, or storage areas of 50m2 to 150m2 than one might expect in a major city. The requirement for an APOP not to have windows or recognizable doors fits nicely with space in real estate that is hard to find a tenant or owner for (and is therefore cheaper to buy).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A room of 100m2 can support an APOP for more than 10,000 connections, including patch cabinets, 19-inch racks for ISP/operator gear, cooling systems, and backup power supplies. The amount of electrical power needed is limited, so normal, business-grade grid connections can be used.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For a city like Amsterdam with 450,000 connections, finding 45-50 locations with an average 100m2 is doable. Therefore, the decision was made to go for APOPs in existing buildings with a size between 5,000 and 15,000 connections.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As we worked on Citynet, in other parts of the Netherlands, other FTTH projects were deployed. Everybody made the same trade-off on topology and decided to build a point-to-point network, so we compared our project with the remaining design choices made by others.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The difference in number of connections of APOPs was hard to explain until somebody started to compare the geographical coverage of an APOP: they all covered an area between 4km2 and 8km2. Apparently there is some natural size of a star network in an urban or semi-urban area; the density of housing determines the number of connections per APOP.

                                Natural boundaries like waterways, highways, or railway tracks limit deployment options, but once a suitable APOP is located, the approximate geographical coverage supported by that APOP can be determined.

                                The next step is to survey the area: how many fibers are needed and what kind of pavement is used?&nbsp;Adding fiber later on is a nightmare, so you need to estimate current and future demand as well as possible.

                                Opening up and restoring the pavement can be very expensive, depending on the type of pavement and its age. Legislation requires you to completely redo pavement that is less than 5 years old, from curb to building. So it might be cheaper to bypass a beautiful crafted sidewalk in a shopping area which is a couple of meters wide, and instead take a small detour through old, narrow pavement. Tiled pavement is easier and cheaper to repair than concrete or tarmac.

                                The land register is a place to start, but it does not fill in the greasy details. Every street has to be surveyed for surprises. An official registered address does not say if it redirects to a houseboat on an Amsterdam canal, a garage box with no occupants, or a multi-story office building.

                                It does not tell you if the owner has decided to rearrange the apartments inside the building to optimize rental income (aka, “split the place up as much as possible”), or has decided to tear down the existing building and build something completely different in the coming years. All this has to be established by surveying, both on foot and by checking planning registries.

                                Big office buildings and special purpose buildings like hotels generate their own headaches. How many individual tenants will be there? Will they all need individual fibers and individual subscriptions to an operator or a service? What will they need 10 years from now?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fortunately, these big buildings are less than 1 percent of the total number of connections, so they were considered to be less important. Most of the corporations and large institutions already have their own fiber connection delivered by a major business provider, with redundancies, specific SLAs, and you-know-what mandated by corporate IT. (No wonder these connections are much more expensive than a regular FTTH connection; they require a lot of customization and customer care.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The physical network was optimized for the remaining 99 percent of connections to homes and small businesses. No redundancy in the access network, no special SLAs, no frills, no customization options for the corporate market, just get the price down by standardization. ISPs could later do whatever they wanted with these access lines to corporate customers as long as it was based upon the standard dark fiber spec, be it SDH, ATM, Ethernet or WDM.
                            </p>

                                A quick survey showed that most corporations tended to see a market for 2 or 3 FTTH-like connections for themselves: one for guest WiFi, one for the IT department <strike>to fool around with</strike> as a backup, and one for top management to have unabridged access to the Internet without the interference of their IT department. Add in a few spare fibers just to be sure, and you have your count.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The opposite are incubator buildings for startups where many small businesses resided, one per office. Every startup needs its own provider and its own voice and Internet solution, so every office gets its own fiber; it's almost Fiber-to-the-Desk.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a design rule, a 10 percent spare capacity in fibers was added after the per-street tally was made. One of the potential uses for the spare capacity is backhaul for short-range wireless stations, as ubiquitous broadband will drive up demand for wireless as well as wired traffic.

                                Multi-dwelling units (apartments) and office buildings with multiple occupants create their own particular challenges. In dense cities like Amsterdam, approximately 90 percent of all housing is MDU, with anywhere from two up to 500 individual apartments per building. The technical challenge is to get the fibers that have been buried in the street inside the building, then distribute them up to each individual apartment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Architects rarely consider utilities and cables as something other than a nuisance, and the building standards are based on copper wires for telephony and coax for cable TV to be put in place during construction. So nobody has given much thought to deploying new (fiber) cables inside existing MDUs... and it shows.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most buildings have to be surveyed from the inside to get any idea of what has to be done to distribute the fiber cabling to each apartment. Sometimes the surveyors return with a pleasant surprise: when the architect has created a neat stack of utility cabinets above each other, accessible from the hallway on each level. Sometimes they return with a headache if the architect has preferred form over function and created many barriers to get to different floors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                How about the existing ducts and pipes which have been used for copper wires or coax cables—can’t they be re-used to get fiber to an apartment? Unfortunately not. There are legal and practical reasons for this (like the unacceptable gap in service delivery you create), but also technical reasons. Quite often the pipes are bent with sharp corners, or filled with dust or cement so you cannot get the original wire out of the duct, let alone put a new fiber cable in there. The lack of predictability is such a burden that it didn’t make sense to try to use these conduits.

                                So a new distribution plan has to be created for a large percentage of MDUs. One part of the plan is the entry point of fibers into the building. If possible, that point is optimized to minimize digging of trenches and restoration of pavement. The other part of the equation is the Fiber Termination Unit (FTU): where in or near the apartment do you terminate the fiber connection and place the fiber modem (CPE)? That turned out to be a tricky question.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The proverbial suburban family home has a utility cabinet near the front door where copper and coax cables are terminated. No such luck in century-old buildings, or new buildings where architects have been instructed to squeeze as much living space and as many apartments out of a given volume as possible. Any solution you can think of to hide a water meter, gas meter, electricity meter, phone wire, or coax cable termination point somewhere, inside or outside the apartment, grouped or dispersed, has been tried. There is one rule: there is no rule.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The fiber modem needs electrical power, and the customers like to keep their existing in-house network intact for Internet, for voice, and for TV. Unfortunately, offering a fully customized FTU position is like writing an open check that has a lot of impact on the costs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The solution has been to create a flowchart based on experience in practical situations which was public and would predict both for the customer and for the contractor where the modem would be placed in particular circumstances.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Did it work? Yes, but it is not an ideal solution for any party. A better approach has been made possible by the introduction of a new breed of fibers that can withstand sharp corners or small radii without losing light. The idea under investigation is that a customer can order a customized modem position inside the apartment for a fee. The FTU is placed in the standard position and the remaining length to the modem is mounted using these highly bendable fibers.

                                The investigations regarding the position of the modem showed how people wrestle with their in-house network. FTTH is not the cause of the problem, but the availability of a lot of capacity brings visibility to the issue.

                                The architects who designed the buildings never considered the demand for broadband and HDTV, did not consider the required wiring, and still don’t. It's up to the people who live there to try to find a solution to string wires and connect all their gear.

                                Why not without wires? All “free band” wireless solutions like TV-over-wireless or Wifi are great inventions, but in a densely populated MDU, the limitations become apparent.&nbsp;Reinforced concrete walls or plasterboard with metal insulation sheeting block radio signals. If everybody around you uses the same solution, chances are you disturb each other’s connections. Wideband N-type Wifi is fast but uses more spectrum.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In fact, one of the most popular items sold in Amsterdam are range extenders for Wifi—not to connect over a longer distance, but to drown out your neighbors’ access points. High speed Homeplug adapters (data over power lines) are not cheap but are a last resort when everything else fails.

                                Most likely, the next innovation will be a fiber for an in-house network that can be drawn alongside electrical wires in their ducts to all the rooms in the house. Ultra high speed wireless links will most likely be the preferred choice for short distances, i.e. within the room itself.

                                The legal position of a party who wants to deploy wires, fibers, and tubes for public telecom networks can differ by country, but the rules regarding the right-of-way to dig are usually well defined. But what if you want to enter an existing MDU with fiber? It appeared there was much less case law here and hardly any experience.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The only case law available said there should be a reasonable balance between the rights of the owner of the building and the right of a customer to get a service of a specific provider, therefore giving the provider a right to construct the necessary wires inside the building.
                            </p>

                                That is a simple issue when talking to an owner of a single family home. But in Amsterdam, the majority of apartments are rentals, which means that the owner of the MDU building is a separate entity or person who does not live inside the building. All other MDUs are required by law to have a homeowners association that decides on common issues regarding all apartment owners—and committees,&nbsp;as a norm,&nbsp;do not decide rapidly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The solution was to develop both a communication package and a standard agreement in partnership with the biggest and most professional real estate owners in the city.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The standard agreement took care of all obvious questions. The owner agrees to the construction of the distribution network inside the building according to a plan. If it is a large complex building, the plan is signed off by the owner so there is no discussion afterwards. Access to the building is guaranteed for construction and repair, and the contractor is responsible for cleaning up and repairing damage. Ownership of the cabling is uncontested so the network can be mortgaged.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The communication package was designed to take away the anxieties of some people living in the MDU. After seeing the pictures in newspapers accompanying articles about fiber (pictures with massive digs and big brightly colored HDPE tubes), they quite often had the impression that these big ugly tubes had to be nailed to the walls of their building to get fiber. The communication materials showed the reality of very slim minitubes or 8mm cables fitted in a small nice guiderail, if visible at all. It also showed that the owner of the building had agreed to the construction and to the plan, so no need to be worried.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After the biggest and most renowned homeowners had agreed to the standard agreement and the communication package, it became much easier to systematically approach all other homeowners to get their agreement as well.

In shopping areas, the work started very early and preferably on a Monday morning so the shop owners could welcome customers again after 2:00 pm, a minimal interruption of business.

You need, after all, to be certain that a given fiber in the APOP conducts light to the correct customer location.

Make sure there is some sort of bathroom facility available in or near the APOP—something easily forgotten in the specs.

                                As all fibers that terminate in a given APOP are getting close to that location, the number of fibers per meter increases. The main cause of damage to buried fibers is a (sub-) contractor hired for another type of work, for instance on water pipes, who starts to dig with a machine without the mandatory check of the cable plans. A small number of broken fibers can be repaired quite quickly, but it obviously gets difficult as the number increases. A number of precautions were taken to prevent that from happening.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                First of all, the number of fibers in one bundle was limited; four bundles of ducts for entering an APOP is common. A separation of one meter between bundles and a cover net 20cm above the bundles reduces the risk of damage by machine digging to multiple bundles. In extreme cases, a shield of concrete was used above the bundles. The design of the network separates out bundles in different directions from the APOP as soon as possible to reduce the potential exposure.

                                Secondly, the high density fiber cables used did not go over 96 fibers per cable. If an HDPE duct with multiple high density fiber cables is broken, you can use multiple welding teams in parallel, one per cable, which is much faster than one team on a very high density cable.

                            <p>
                                The SLAs on repairs range from 4 hours for a few fibers to 24 hours for major disruptions with a large number of fibers. In practice this has worked quite well. Very few damages of fiber cables have been reported, and all were in minor branches of the network.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a thought exercise, a scenario had been developed for a catastrophe. Assume that the building where the APOP is located was completely destroyed by an airplane or bomb. What do you do?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It turns out that given the availability of new electronic equipment, it is quite feasible to construct an emergency APOP and get everything connected again within 6 to 8 weeks. In the meantime, a wireless backup service could be made available using fiber connections from the surrounding FTTH areas. After all, the distances are relatively small.

                                Getting inside an apartment
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The final stretch of the construction was to get the fibers inside a building, build the internal distribution network up to the individual apartment, blow the fiber, do the necessary welding inside the internal distribution box in the basement, mount the connectors and the FTU, and do the required quality control.&nbsp;In some buildings this is a relatively straightforward process, in some it isn’t. But even in the easy buildings, we quickly learned that the process should be improved.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Living in a big city is expensive, so in many cases both partners work. They do not like to have to take time off from work so the contractor can do his work. Therefore, the less time is needed for someone to be home, the better. The more flexible the timing is (early in the morning, lunch time, late afternoon, user selectable appointments), the better.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A distribution box in the basement where you weld the blown fiber from the apartment to the buried fibers is a design that requires a lot of time with someone “at home.” Construct the distribution network, place the minitube, blow the fiber, weld the fiber, test it, weld the connector on the fiber and mount the FTU. During a part of the process the construction workers are in the basement and not inside the apartment, which led to situations where the tenant left his apartment and closed the door.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An improved process uses miniature direct burial cables in the street which are distributed inside the building without any welding, directly to the apartment. This saves a lot of “open door” time. The Genexis CPE with prefabricated fibers and dummy-proof connectors is another example of a design optimized for time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The really difficult buildings are the ones where you need everyone’s cooperation. If the design of the building leaves you no choice but to get inside each apartment to construct the internal distribution cabling it gets quite difficult. One example is if the utility cabinets are placed inside the apartments. Nicely stacked on top of each other, a piece of cake to drill a hole in the floor to the next cabinet and guide the cable. You only need someone to open the door, and the next one, and the next one.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This can be a showstopper if on the first floor of a 25 story apartment block someone is away on a world tour for six months. Or if someone refuses to open the door or answer calls for no apparent reason.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The original proposal of the general contractor responsible for the deployment seemed like a good idea. Bring all the fibers you will ever need inside an MDU building during the initial digging phase, then build the internal distribution network on-demand. It delays investments and you do not bother people who have&nbsp;yet&nbsp;to decide if they want to take up fiber. Given good preparation, a plan for how to build the internal network, and an agreement with the owner of the building, that should be doable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some experimentation showed, however, that the social engineering needed to get everybody’s attention and cooperation should not be diluted over time this way. The results are much better if, directly after the digging, buildings are targeted with the purpose of getting a fiber and an FTU in all apartments in one concentrated effort.

                                Deploying FTTH in these kinds of cities with a lot of MDUs, where you have to bury cables and distribute fiber inside buildings, requires a different mindset and approach compared to suburban deployments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The key to success is an extensive preparation, a detailed design, good organization, and social engineering when dealing with people who live in the MDUs; in fact, this is much more important than trenching and putting in fiber. Only 120,000 meters of trenching was needed for the first 40,000 connections, an average of three meters per connection. Roughly 80 percent of the costs were labor costs, while 10 percent were fiber.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The payoff for the effort is that fiber, once deployed, has proven to be very reliable. So it makes sense not to cut corners and deploy a network that can be used for as many decades as possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And yes: houseboats can get fiber-to-the-boat, using a military grade fiber connector.
