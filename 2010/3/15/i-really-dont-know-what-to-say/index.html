                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Sad and upsetting times in Ireland. <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0315/breaking18.html">Cardinal Brady</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/8568280.stm">it turns out</a>, was instrumentally involved in the closed investigation of the monstrous Fr. Smyth, and himself swore to secrecy two children raped by Smyth. The incident simply resulted in Smyth getting some form of censure from the Church and going on to rape and abuse many, many more children. Whose parents were in turn stonewalled by the Church. How does anyone get over this? Should they?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, Pope Ratzinger is wriggling off the hook – at least this hook, this time – for his own involvement in a cover up. It’s odd to me that people are searching so intently for Ratzinger’s smoking gun, when as head of the Congregation for the Indoctrination of the Faith, he wrote to bishops telling them that breaking the seal of secrecy on church investigations of sex abuse was punishable by excommunication. That’s the smoking gun that destroyed not just the childhoods and perhaps lives of one or two children in Ratzinger’s direct responsibility, but thousands of children around the world who deserved better from the one, true Church.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Irish adult voices of raped children are joined by American ones; people now grown up who were raped and abused by Fr. Smith when he was sent away from these shores and off to where he wasn’t known and could start again. A Connecticut woman poignantly asks why she was repeatedly raped by a priest who had been sent to America instead of to the police. An Irish woman asks why no one went to the police. If they had, she might have been saved. Many might have been saved.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Cardinal Brady’s voice on the radio saying it was different times then, and he chose differently. And that others are guilty of doing nothing also; teachers, doctors, the media itself. And it’s true, but only part of the whole truth. So strange to hear the institution that stands for absolute moral values and the timeless nature of sin asking to not be judged by the mores of another time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Forty years ago, the <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0630/1224249782433.html">Fethard-on-Sea boycott</a> took place. Another case of the Church claiming dominion over the souls of Irish children while destroying their childhoods.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Three weeks ago I listened to my parish priest go through the motions of reading out the Cardinal’s letter, asking for prayers for the Irish bishops as they went to visit the pope in Rome. Then a week passed of outrage that no bishop was called on the carpet. Then a statement from the Vatican that said our modern cult of not respecting ‘the dignity of the human person’ was to blame for it all. That’s usually code for saying gay people sin mortally, or that women’s bodies are the Church’s to dispose of. What on earth can they mean in this context?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Reading the Cardinal’s letter in a monotone, the priest had just sent all the first holy communion kids back down off the alter to sit with their parents. His pure joy at celebrating the rite of passage with the children was innocent and good. But can anyone else see it that way ever again? After the victims of abuse – and far, far behind them – those most hurt are the parish priests who’ve given over their lives to something bigger and supposed to be better than themselves. They are betrayed by their leaders and distrusted by the faithful.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A week or two later another bishop was asking for a special collection of 60,000 euro to pay off the victims. Otherwise the diocese might have to start selling property. A new meaning for the term ‘blame the victim’. Another round of newspaper and radio interviews of people coming out of Mass. One of them said churches are full of old people and middle aged ones that have been sold a pup. But they’ve nowhere else to go.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A spokesman sympathetic to the Church reminds us that most abuse happens within the family. He’s right. Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0306/1224265703697.html">children of parents who inflicted unspeakable abuse</a> on them sue the state for not stopping it. The state did try, ten years ago and not hard enough, but was stopped from intervening in the sacred zone of the family by a constitutional court case bankrolled by a rightwing Catholic organisation from abroad. Today, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iona_Institute">home grown Catholic lobby group</a> lobbies against a constitutional amendment on rights for children. (Unborn children have rights contra their parents. Born children, not so much.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The quiet dignity and sheer persistence of victims of the abuse talking on the radio every day or every second day. Joe Duffy trying to whip up his own easily stirred moral outrage, and being quietly side stepped by the people who’ve truly been hurt. Some of them think bishops’ resignations can help. Others have given up hope on the lot or, with unbelievable generosity, say getting a few scalps now won’t help them and will only harm the innocent believers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Is there such a thing as an innocent believer?
                            </p>
