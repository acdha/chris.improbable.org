                                <strong>By Thoreau</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/feature/2010/03/15/ayn_rand/index.html">Michael Lind</a> argues that libertarianism is becoming the ascendant faction in the Republican Party.&nbsp; I have three levels of response.&nbsp; On the most basic level, I never really know what to make of a Lind column.&nbsp; I am not nearly as conversant with American history as he is, so I can never refute any of his takes on a factual level, but they always strike me as just a bit too neat.&nbsp; A decade ago he was explaining that all of American history and politics made perfect sense if you just understood the cultural roots of a few different waves of immigration, most of them from different parts of Great Britain.&nbsp; Here he’s saying that all of American politics for the last 70 years, or at least the GOP portion of it, makes perfect sense if you just understand 3 basic movements.&nbsp; It’s all too…neat.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Going to the substance of it, the obvious response would be that libertarianism is the opiate of the minority party, and that Republicans have never shown much interest in it once they actually have power.&nbsp; <em>Of course</em> a movement that is out of power will explain that they oppose the ruling party out of a principled skepticism of power.&nbsp; And <em>of course</em> they will forget all of that once in power.&nbsp; Then again, libertarianism is hardly unique among intellectual or ideological movements in being betrayed by politicians in power.&nbsp; Go talk to a progressive, or liberal, or whatever some time, and ask them whether a politician has ever broken a promise made to them.&nbsp; Though politicians will always betray a movement once in power, a movement can still provide energy and intellectual firepower for campaigns and policy dialogues, even if they don’t actually get what they want.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, the question is, to what extent does libertarianism play into the energy and animation of the Republican Party?&nbsp; Two very different answers come to mind:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                1)&nbsp; The Tea Party Movement
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2)&nbsp; Intellectual firepower for the plutocrats
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the Teabagger (<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=teabagging">hee!</a>) front, I confess to not having much in-depth or personal knowledge of that movement.&nbsp; I am told that some of the figures in that movement really do believe in libertarian ideas.&nbsp; My immediate reply is “You just figured out <em>now</em> that government is big and intrusive?&nbsp; Were you in a coma between 2001 and 2008?&nbsp; Did the intertubes get clogged?&nbsp; Or, in true libertarian fashion, were you simply stoned?” The charitable response is that many of them were opposed to everything happening then, but it was hard to get traction for “limited government” talk in 2001-2008 because the natural constituency for the rhetoric (not to be confused with the ideas) leans right.&nbsp; Now, I know that UO commenters have many, many snorts to give there, but even if we adopt the most charitable response for the sake of argument, you’re still left with a movement in which the rank and file is not terribly interested in any of the ideas in libertarianism beyond “Team Blue politicians should be subject to opposition.”&nbsp; I don’t see much libertarian depth there.&nbsp; Libertarianism seems more like a veneer to be tossed aside at the next Red victory rather than a driving force.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Intellectual firepower for the plutocracy is a more complicated matter.&nbsp; On one level, if a party adopts just one facet of an ideology, do we really get to blame that ideology for whatever the party does?&nbsp; To me, libertarianism is multi-faceted with many insights.&nbsp; Yes, skepticism of regulation and taxes is one facet.&nbsp; Social tolerance is another.&nbsp; If you just want somebody who will cut taxes, you don’t need a libertarian; any Republican will do.&nbsp; The difference is that a libertarian supposedly also wants the government out of your bedroom as well as the boardroom, and is as <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/">skeptical of the no-knock raid</a> as he is of the IRS auditor.&nbsp; And libertarians claim to be as concerned about small business as big business.&nbsp; Say what you will about libertarian stances on regulation of big corporations, but groups like Reason and the Institute for Justice are spot-0n when they find blatantly absurd regulations that mostly hurt people starting new small businesses while protecting existing businesses from competition.&nbsp; And some libertarians (e.g. <a href="http://highclearing.com/">these guys</a>) even observe that military spending is, in fact, government spending, and that drug prohibition is an act of social engineering with negative effects that dwarf any social service program.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We can argue over one must embrace an entire list to deserve a label, but I’d say that one should embrace more than just one item on the list to merit a label.&nbsp; Otherwise, everyone would be a libertarian, from the CEO who only agrees with us on regulation of big business (but not small business) to the leftist who only agrees with us on warrantless wiretaps, to the hippie too stoned to remember our stances on any issue other than….dude, what was I talking about, and on to the cranky old man next door who is isolationist because he doesn’t trust them furriners, but is fine with, well, just about anything else the gov’t does.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Now, don’t confuse this with a defense of libertarianism.&nbsp; If the elites of the GOP mostly just like us because we have in our ranks many who will write apologia in exchange for 30 pieces of silver, then lambast us for that.&nbsp; <em>But saying that libertarianism is dominated by the Reds is not the same as saying that libertarians dominate the Reds.</em> If they are using us, it reflects poorly on us, but it does not follow that we are ascendant in their ranks.&nbsp; If anything, it makes us look even worse, because we sold ourselves to them and all we got in return was this lousy t-shirt that they charged us 29 pieces of silver for.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In invite you to re-read the previous paragraph as many times as you deem necessary.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ahem.&nbsp; I said, read the paragraph in bold.&nbsp; Yes, you.&nbsp; Read it before you comment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’m not writing this to defend libertarianism from the charge of being infiltrated by the GOP.&nbsp; I’m writing this to argue that the GOP has not been overcome by libertarianism.&nbsp; Those are two entirely different things.&nbsp; From where I sit, I see some useful idiots for the GOP in the libertarian ranks, but I see precious little libertarianism animating the Republicans.&nbsp; If you’re going to blame us for anything, blame us for shilling, not for animating.
