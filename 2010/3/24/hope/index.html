                                <strong>By Thoreau</strong>

                                <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-marijuana-initiative24-2010mar24,0,3970255.story">The marijuana legalization ballot measure is expected to make it onto the November ballot.</a> Whatever else may happen, if this passes then 2010 will be a good political year, because it will be the year that the drug warriors suffer their worst setback ever.  If this passes, criminal organizations will lose money.  Police will receive fewer bribes.  Fewer harmless people will go to prison.  Police will have one less excuse to pull over a black man driving a car.  (They’ll do it anyway, but they won’t be able to drag him to jail if they happen to find something harmless in his car.)  And the propagandists will be revealed for the  liars that they are if weed is legalized and the sky does not fall.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’m not holding my breath for  it to pass, but rest assured that I’ll be donating to the campaign, and if I don’t accept  a job out of state I’ll be volunteering.  Whatever else happens in November, whether good cop or bad cop gets Congress, whether tweedle dumb or tweedle dumber gets the governor’s mansion, if this passes it will be a good political year.

                                    [Law Enforcement <span style="text-decoration:line-through">Whore</span> Lobbyist] Lovell said he is not worried about “the deep pockets on that side.” He noted that opponents of Proposition 5, which would have let nonviolent drug offenders avoid prison, defeated it in 2008 despite being outspent.

                                Out-spent?  Let’s see, the  prohibitionists can draw on dollars from every major organized crime organization on the globe, law enforcement unions, <span style="text-decoration:line-through">defense</span> offense <span style="text-decoration:line-through">contractors</span> rent seekers (what do you think those bases in South America are for?), and every public employee taking bribes from organized crime.  They have the power to investigate their opponents at will, and drag them to jail if they find any technical violations.  Every dark power on earth is in their corner.  In our corner?  A handful in Gen X and Gen Y who are politically engaged and unimpressed by the propaganda (and who have something to donate in this recession), the handful of Boomers who have gotten over lingering guilt and/or kulturkampf hangovers from the 1960’s, a few economists and libertarian policy wonks, the occasional straight-laced turncoat, some latte sippers, and a few small businesses hoping to sell legal weed.

                                Yeah, I’m gonna go out on a limb and say that the prohibitionists have the deeper pockets here.  OK, a lot of their money is tied up in numbered Caymans accounts, but I’m sure they have ways to move that cash if needed.
