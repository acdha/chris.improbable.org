                                    The Obama administration not only appears disinclined to destroy the "rings" forged by the Bush administration, but they are arguing for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/us/24scotus.html">more and bigger rings</a>:

                                        The line between speech protected by the First Amendment and aid to terrorists appeared elusive at the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/supreme_court/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the U.S. Supreme Court.">Supreme Court</a> on Tuesday, and the justices’ lively questioning complicated rather than clarified matters. They <a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/08-1498.pdf">discussed</a> travel to Cuba, the Communist and Nazi Parties, Tokyo Rose, treason and whether it is a crime to teach a terrorist how to play the harmonica.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Even seemingly benign help is prohibited, Ms. Kagan said. [...]

                                        Ms. Kagan gave examples of prohibited conduct. A lawyer would commit a crime, she said, by filing a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of a terrorist group. Helping such a group petition international bodies is also a crime, she added.
                                    </p>

He seemed to expect a negative answer.

                                        But Ms. Kagan would say only that the matter would involve a “prosecutorial judgment.”

                                    Think about that for a moment: the Obama administration is arguing that it is a crime for a lawyer to <strike>defend a group - or even</strike> <em>write an amicus brief on behalf of a group</em>  that the administration declares (unilaterally, and without oversight) to be a terrorist organization.  On their word.  Accusation alone.  Amazing.

                                    Actually, you can't even make a public presentation at the United Nations - maybe, depending on the discretion of the prosecutor, which is a sure fire way to preserve individual freedoms.
