                                        Here at <a href="http://ksplice.com">Ksplice</a>, we’re always keeping a very close eye on vulnerabilities that are being announced in Linux. And in the last half of last year, it was very clear that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computing)#Null_pointer">NULL pointer</a> dereference vulnerabilities were the current big thing. <a href="http://grsecurity.net/">Brad Spengler</a> made it <a href="http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/9627">abundantly clear</a> to anyone who was paying the least bit attention that these vulnerabilities, far more than being mere <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">denial of service attacks</a>, were trivially exploitable privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Some observers even dubbed 2009 the <a href="http://www.awe.com/mark/blog/20100216.html">year of the kernel NULL pointer dereference</a>.
                                    </p>

                                        If you’ve ever programmed in C, you’ve probably run into a <code>NULL</code> pointer dereference at some point. But almost certainly, all it did was crash your program with the dreaded “Segmentation Fault”. Annoying, and often painful to debug, but nothing more than a crash. So how is it that this simple programming error becomes so dangerous when it happens in the kernel? Inspired by all the fuss, this post will explore a little bit of how memory works behind the scenes on your computer. By the end of today’s installment, we’ll understand how to write a C program that reads and writes to a <code>NULL</code> pointer without crashing. In a future post, I’ll take it a step further and go all the way to showing how an attacker would exploit a <code>NULL</code> pointer dereference in the kernel to take control of a machine!

                                            There’s nothing fundamentally magical about pointers in C (or assembly, if that’s your thing). A pointer is just an integer, that (with the help of the hardware) refers to a location somewhere in that big array of bits we call a computer’s memory. We can write a C program to print out a random pointer:
                                        </p>
                                        <pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  printf("The argv pointer = %d\n", argv);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
                                        <p>
                                            Which, if you run it on my machine, prints:
                                        </p>
                                        <pre>
The argv pointer = 1680681096
</pre>
                                        <p>
                                            (Pointers are conventionally written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a>, which would make that <code>0x642d2888</code>, but that’s just a notational thing. They’re still just integers.)
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <code>NULL</code> is only slightly special as a pointer value: if we look in <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/linux/include/linux/stddef.h">stddef.h</a>, we can see that it’s just defined to be the pointer with value 0. The only thing really special about <code>NULL</code> is that, by convention, the operating system sets things up so that <code>NULL</code> is an invalid pointer, and any attempts to read or write through it lead to an error, which we call a <b>segmentation fault</b>. However, this is just convention; to the hardware, <code>NULL</code> is just another possible pointer value.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            But what do those integers actually mean? We need to understand a little bit more about how memory works in a modern computer. In the old days (and still on many embedded devices), a pointer value was literally an index into all of the memory on those little RAM chips in your computer:
                                        </p>
                                        <div style="width:146px">
                                            <a href="http://blog.ksplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/physmem.jpg"><img src="http://blog.ksplice.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/physmem-136x300.jpg" alt="Diagram of Physical Memory Addresses" title="Physical Memory Addresses" width="136" height="300"></a>

                                        <p>
                                            This was true for every program, including the operating system itself. You can probably guess what goes wrong here: suppose that Microsoft Word is storing your document at address <code>700</code> in memory. Now, you’re browsing the web, and a bug in Internet Explorer causes it to start scribbling over random memory and it happens to scribble over memory around address <code>700</code>. Suddenly, <b>bam</b>, Internet Explorer takes Word down with it. It’s actually even worse than that: a bug in IE can even take down the entire operating system.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This was widely regarded as a bad move, and so all modern hardware supports, and operating systems use, a scheme called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory">virtual memory</a>. What this means it that every program running on your computer has its own namespace for pointers (from 0 to 2<sup>32</sup>-1, on a 32-bit machine). The value <code>700</code> means something completely different to Microsoft Word and Internet Explorer, and neither can access the other’s memory. The operating system is in charge of managing these so-called address spaces, and mapping different pieces of each program’s address space to different pieces of physical memory.

                                            One feature of this setup is that while each process has its own 2<sup>32</sup> possible addresses, not all of them need to be valid (correspond to real memory). In particular, by default, the <code>NULL</code> or <code>0</code> pointer does not correspond to valid memory, which is why accessing it leads to a crash.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Because each application has its own address space, however, it is free to do with it as it wants. For instance, you’re welcome to declare that <code>NULL</code> should be a valid address in your application. We refer to this as “mapping” the <code>NULL</code> page, because you’re declaring that that area of memory should map to some piece of physical memory.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            On Linux (and other UNIX) systems, the function call used for mapping regions of memory is <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/mmap"><code>mmap(2)</code></a>. <code>mmap</code> is defined as:
                                        </p>
                                        <pre>
void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags,
           int fd, off_t offset);
</pre>
                                        <p>
                                            Let’s go through those arguments in order (All of this information comes from the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/mmap">man page</a>):
                                        </p>
                                        <dl>

                                            </dt>
                                            <dd>
                                                This is the address where the application wants to map memory. If <code>MAP_FIXED</code> is not specified in <code>flags</code>, <code>mmap</code> may select a different address if the selected one is not available or inappropriate for some reason.
                                            </dd>

                                                Short for “protection”, this argument must be a combination of one or more of the values <code>PROT_READ</code>, <code>PROT_WRITE</code>, <code>PROT_EXEC</code>, or <code>PROT_NONE</code>, indicating whether the application should be able to read, write, execute, or none of the above, the mapped memory.
                                            </dd>
                                            <dt>
                                                <code>flags</code>
                                            </dt>
                                            <dd>
                                                Controls various options about the mapping. There are a number of flags that can go here. Some interesting ones are <code>MAP_PRIVATE</code>, which indicates the mapping should not be shared with any other process, <code>MAP_ANONYMOUS</code>, which indicates that the <code>fd</code> argument is irrelevant, and <code>MAP_FIXED</code>, which indicates that we want memory located exactly at <code>addr</code>.
                                            </dd>
                                            <dt>
                                                <code>fd</code>
                                            </dt>
                                            <dd>
                                                The primary use of <code>mmap</code> is not just as a memory allocator, but in order to map files on disk to appear in a process’s address space, in which case <code>fd</code> refers to an open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor">file descriptor</a> to map. Since we just want a random chunk of memory, we’re going pass <code>MAP_ANONYMOUS</code> in <code>flags</code>, which indicates that we don’t want to map a file, and <code>fd</code> is irrelevant.
                                            </dd>
                                            <dt>
                                                <code>offset</code>
                                            </dt>
                                            <dd>
                                                This argument would be used with <code>fd</code> to indicate which portion of a file we wanted to map.
                                            </dd>
                                        </dl>
                                        <p>
                                            <code>mmap</code> returns the address of the new mapping, or <code>MAP_FAILED</code> if something went wrong.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            If we just want to be able to read and write the <code>NULL</code> pointer, we’ll want to set <code>addr</code> to 0 and <code>length</code> to 4096, in order to map the first page of memory. We’ll need <code>PROT_READ</code> and <code>PROT_WRITE</code> to be able to read and write, and all three of the <code>flags</code> I mentioned. <code>fd</code> and <code>offset</code> are irrelevant; we’ll set them to <code>-1</code> and <code>0</code> respectively.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Putting it all together, we get the following short C program, which successfully reads and writes through a <code>NULL</code> pointer without crashing!
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            (Note that most modern systems actually specifically disallow mapping the NULL page, out of security concerns. To run the following example on a recent Linux machine at home, you’ll need to run <code># echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr</code> as root, first.)
                                        </p>
                                        <pre>
#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
  int *ptr = NULL;
  if (mmap(0, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
           MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_FIXED, -1, 0)
      == MAP_FAILED) {
    perror("Unable to mmap(NULL)");
    fprintf(stderr, "Is /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr non-zero?\n");
    return 1;
  }
  printf("Defererencing my NULL pointer yields: %d\n", *ptr);
  *ptr = 17;
  printf("Now it's: %d\n", *ptr);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
                                        <p>
                                            Next time, we’ll look at how a process can not only map <code>NULL</code> in its own address space, but can also create mappings in the kernel’s address space. And, I’ll show you how this lets an attacker use a <code>NULL</code> dereference in the kernel to take over the entire machine. Stay tuned!
