                            <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/03/does-high-fructose-corn-syrup-make-you-fatter.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss"><img vspace="4" hspace="4" border="0" align="right" src="http://static.arstechnica.com/assets/2010/03/high_fructose_ars-thumb-230x130-12811-f.jpg"></a>
                            <p>
                                The use of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has boomed in recent years, driven primarily by its low cost and ease of use in beverages. The increased levels in the US diet have roughly corresponded to the timing of the obesity epidemic, which has led many to suspect there's a causal relationship. But definitive evidence that the body responds to HFCS in a manner that's distinct from any other caloric intake has been difficult to come by. A group of researchers from Princeton now claim to have provided a conclusive demonstration that HFCS triggers obesity in rats, but there are enough oddities in the data that it would be wise to reserve judgement until the work is replicated.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Chemically, HFCS is a mix of fructose and glucose, the two components of table sugar. Unlike in table sugar (sucrose), however, the two are not chemically linked, and there's a slight excess of fructose instead of the 50:50 mix present in sucrose. These differences are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things, but there has been a consistent flow of studies that suggest the body responds quite differently to sucrose and HFCS, including indications of different fat metabolism and insulin responses. One idea that that's been proposed is that fructose doesn't induce the same sense of satiation that glucose does, meaning that we're less likely to stop eating after we've ingested sufficient calories.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the absence of a coherent picture on the biochemistry, the new study attempts to look at the longer term impact of access to HFCS. The Princeton study set up groups of age-, weight-, and sex-matched rats, and gave them access to all the chow they could eat. In addition, different groups of rats were given access to an HFCS solution for either 12 or 24 hours; another group were given a similar sucrose solution, and a control group was simply given water. The amount of calories consumed, both from rat chow and sugar solutions, was monitored daily, and the rats were weighed every week. Two experiments were run, one for two months, the second for six.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At the end of the shorter trial, the male rats with 12-hour access to HFCS had gained significantly more weight than the group given access to sucroseâ€”even though they actually consumed fewer calories in liquid form (the sucrose group ate enough chow to make up for the difference). That seems pretty important until you look at some of the details: the 24-hour HFCS group consumed roughly the same number of calories, on average, as their 12-hour peers, but didn't put on the same amount of weight. In fact, the 24-hour group wasn't significantly different (in the statistical sense) than either the sucrose or chow-only controls.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The longer-term study could have clarified exactly what was going on here, but the authors eliminated the sucrose group, "Since we did not see effects of sucrose on body weight in Experiment 1." In this experiment, the 24-hour group actually gained more weight than the control population as early as three weeks into the experiment. In fact, they gained more weight than the 12-hour group, although this difference isn't statistically significant. It doesn't appear that the authors attempted to explain why the two experiments seem to have produced different results.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At the end of this study, the fat pads were dissected out and weighed, and the abdominal fat pads of the 12-hour group were significantly different from those of the chow-only control. However, the abdominal fat of the 24-hour group (which, remember, gained more weight) wasn't significantly heavier than the control group.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To confuse matters further, the authors also ran a group of females through the long-term study protocol, and this time included a group with access to a sucrose solution. Females gained less weight in general than males, and those with 12-hour access to either HFCS or sucrose solutions finished the experiment in a statistical dead heat. Only the 24-hour HFCS group showed a significant increase in weight gain (and had a corresponding increase in fat deposition).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (One other thing that seems worth noting is that the procedures took place during a time when the rats normally gain weight. For example, the chow-only control group doubled in weight during the long-term experiment, while the HFCS group bulked up by roughly 260 percent.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although some of the results are suggestive, given the somewhat confusing and, in some cases, contradictory nature of the result, it would seem to be appropriate to interpret them with caution, and go back and start a larger population of rats on a study with a more consistent design. The authors haven't gone that route, as their conclusion (in its entirety) reads, "In summary, rats maintained on a diet rich in HFCS for 6 or 7 months show abnormal weight gain, increased circulating TG and augmented fat deposition. All of these factors indicate obesity. Thus, over-consumption of HFCS could very well be a major factor in the 'obesity epidemic,' which correlates with the upsurge in the use of HFCS."

                                Their host institution, Princeton, has also <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S26/91/22K07/">put out a press release</a> that also glosses over the uncertainties. (It also has a hilarious picture of the research group attempting to look like they're doing science.) Wikipedia's HFCS entry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-fructose_corn_syrup">has already been updated</a>, and links to the <a href="http://www.corn.org/princeton-hfcs-study-errors.html">corn industry's response</a>. Fortunately, though, the mainstream media has largely given this paper a pass, which may cut down on the confusion as we wait for a larger, more definitive study.
