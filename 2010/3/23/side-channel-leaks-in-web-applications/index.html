                                Popular online applications may leak your private data to a network eavesdropper, even if you're using secure web connections, according to a new <a href="http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/xw7/WebAppSideChannel-final.pdf">paper</a> by Shuo Chen, Rui Wang, XiaoFeng Wang, and Kehuan Zhang. (Chen is at Microsoft Research; the others are at Indiana.) It's a sobering result -- yet another illustration of how much information can be leaked by ordinary web technologies. It's also really clever.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here's the background: Secure web connections encrypt traffic so that only your browser and the web server you're visiting can see the contents of your communication. Although a network eavesdropper can't understand the requests your browser sends, nor the replies from the server, it has long been known that an eavesdropper can see the <i>size</i> of the request and reply messages, and that these sizes sometimes leak information about which page you're viewing, if the request size (i.e., the size of the URL) or the reply size (i.e., the size of the HTML page you're viewing) is distinctive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The new paper shows that this inference-from-size problem gets much, much worse when pages are using the now-standard AJAX programming methods, in which a web "page" is really a computer program that makes frequent requests to the server for information. With more requests to the server, there are many more opportunities for an eavesdropper to make inferences about what you're doing -- to the point that common applications leak a great deal of private information.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Consider a search engine that autocompletes search queries: when you start to type a query, the search engine gives you a list of suggested queries that start with whatever characters you have typed so far. When you type the first letter of your search query, the search engine page will send that character to the server, and the server will send back a list of suggested completions. Unfortunately, the size of that suggested completion list will depend on which character you typed, so an eavesdropper can use the size of the encrypted response to deduce which letter you typed. When you type the second letter of your query, another request will go to the server, and another encrypted reply will come back, which will again have a distinctive size, allowing the eavesdropper (who already knows the first character you typed) to deduce the second character; and so on. In the end the eavesdropper will know exactly which search query you typed. This attack worked against the Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft Bing search engines.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many web apps that handle sensitive information seem to be susceptible to similar attacks. The researchers studied a major online tax preparation site (which they don't name) and found that it leaks a fairly accurate estimate of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). This happens because the exact set of questions you have to answer, and the exact data tables used in tax preparation, will vary based on your AGI. To give one example, there is a particular interaction relating to a possible student loan interest calculation, that only happens if your AGI is between $115,000 and $145,000 -- so that the presence or absence of the distinctively-sized message exchange relating to that calculation tells an eavesdropper whether your AGI is between $115,000 and $145,000. By assembling a set of clues like this, an eavesdropper can get a good fix on your AGI, plus information about your family status, and so on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For similar reasons, a major online health site leaks information about which medications you are taking, and a major investment site leaks information about your investments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The paper goes on to consider possible mitigations. The most obvious mitigation is to add padding to messages so that their sizes are not so distinctive -- for example, every message might be padded to make its size a multiple of 256 bytes. This turns out to be less effective than you might expect -- significant information can still leak even if messages are generously padded -- and the padded messages are slower and more expensive to transmit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We don't know which sites the researchers studied, but it seems like a safe bet that most, if not all, of the sites in these product categories have similar problems. It's important to keep these attacks in perspective -- bear in mind that they can only be carried out by someone who can eavesdrop on the network between you and the site you're visiting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's becoming increasingly clear that securing web-based applications is very difficult, and that the basic tools for developing web apps don't do much to help. The industry, and researchers, will be struggling with web app security issues for years to come.
