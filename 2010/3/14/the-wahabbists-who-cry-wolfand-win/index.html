                            <p>
                                <strong>By Thoreau</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My biggest fear has always been that Al Qaeda will move away from trying big, flashy, mass-casualty attacks on high-profile targets, and start doing lots of small attacks.  Bringing down skyscrapers again would take a lot of planning and a group of trained, reliable men who have been recruited through networks.  All of this can show up on the radar, or at the very least the plan can go amiss.  But telling a dozen different guys “Look, just plant an improvised bomb, any old improvised bomb.  It will scare the hell out of them” is a different matter.  Getting maximum impact out of an improvised bomb, especially in a juicy target, might take more planning than a disgruntled loner is capable of, but scaring us with an improvised bomb is easy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well, <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/2010/03/11/us_al_qaida_lone_gunmen/index.html">Al Qaeda’s propagandists are apparently starting to get this:</a>

                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    “Even apparently unsuccessful attacks on Western mass transportation systems can bring major cities to a halt, cost the enemy billions and send his corporations into bankruptcy,” Gadahn said in a video released and translated by U.S.-based Site Intelligence Group, which monitors Islamic militant message traffic.

                                Look at Maj. Hassan and the Underwear Bomber:  Maj. Hassan acted basically on his own, but he was apparently in email contact with somebody in Yemen.  And although people died in that tragedy, it was hardly on the scale of 9/11, or even a well-planned car bomb in an Iraqi marketplace.*  The Underwear Bomber was also apparently in contact with somebody in Yemen, and he failed to hurt anybody other than himself.  But the result of all this?  We now have flying killer robots and government employees and mercenaries and who the hell knows what else doing shit in Yemen.  And whatever it is that they’re doing, it isn’t cheap.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Look at the Liquids of Death plot from summer of 2006.  Although most chemists (but admittedly not all) say that concocting an improvised liquid bomb from small quantities of liquid in an airplane bathroom is unlikely at best, the Department of Homeland Security** has declared a permanent <em>jihad</em> against liquids that might profane the purity of our bodily fluids.  We are subjecting ourselves to a permanent hassle over an implausible attack that never moved past the planning stage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Friend-of-the-blog <a href="http://feralgenius.blogspot.com/">Jennifer</a> once observed in some conversation somewhere (can’t recall where, as I chat with her in a few different forums) that eventually Al Qaeda won’t have to do anything other than jump up and yell “Boo!” to get us to do something bad to ourselves.  That may be a slight exaggeration, but I suspect that if every week, for a few months, an angry Muslim were to set off an improvised bomb (even a poorly-constructed one) or go somewhere and start firing a gun, although the casualty counts would never reach anywhere even remotely close to 9/11 levels, or even the monthly death toll from car accidents, we would probably do something really awful in response.  And it sounds like Al Qaeda is starting to realize this.  And that scares me.  I’m not worried about being there when the random whackjob starts shooting; statistically I’m more likely to die driving to work.  I’m worried about what we do in response.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, if any Al Qaeda members are reading, first, be sure to purchase the GPS beacons sold by our fine sponsors.  When you’re trying to navigate in caves beneath snow-capped mountains, you need the best in homing technology.  Second, I won’t be impressed unless you mount a drastic, mass casualty attack that requires years of planning, intensive use of electronic communications, lots of money spent on traceable items, and significant travel by people on watch lists.  Do you hear me?  Nothing else will impress me, so don’t even bother.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                *Would it be tasteless to observe that he also killed fewer people than a CIA flying killer robot at an Afghan wedding party?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                **I still can’t get over the fact that we have a department with a name like that.  It’s just plain wrong.
