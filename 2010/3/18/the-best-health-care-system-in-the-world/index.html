                                    Just think, in the rest of the industrialized world, citizens get their fully guaranteed, never rescinded&nbsp;health insurance from the "government" which is always the problem, never the solution.&nbsp; We Americans, on the other hand, get our insurance from the private sector, which&nbsp;means it is, by definition, more efficient and a superior performing product.&nbsp; We know this because government never outperforms the free market.&nbsp; From the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62G2DO20100317">incomparable Murray Waas</a>:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        In May, 2002, Jerome Mitchell, a 17-year old college freshman from rural South Carolina, learned he had contracted HIV. The news, of course, was devastating, but Mitchell believed that he had one thing going for him: On his own initiative, in anticipation of his first year in college, he had purchased his own health insurance.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Shortly after his diagnosis, however, his insurance company, Fortis, revoked his policy. Mitchell was told that without further treatment his HIV would become full-blown AIDS within a year or two and he would most likely die within two years after that.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        So he hired an attorney -- not because he wanted to sue anyone; on the contrary, the shy African-American teenager expected his insurance was canceled by mistake and would be reinstated once he set the company straight.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But Fortis, now known as Assurant Health, ignored his attorney's letters, as they had earlier inquiries from a case worker at a local clinic who was helping him. So Mitchell sued.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In 2004, a jury in Florence County, South Carolina, ordered Assurant Health, part of Assurant Inc, to pay Mitchell $15 million for wrongly revoking his heath insurance policy.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In September 2009, the South Carolina Supreme Court upheld the lower court's verdict, although the court reduced the amount to be paid him to $10 million.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        By winning the verdict against Fortis, Mitchell not only obtained a measure of justice for himself; he also helped expose wrongdoing on the part of Fortis that could have repercussions for the entire health insurance industry.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Previously undisclosed records from Mitchell's case reveal that Fortis had a company policy of targeting policyholders with HIV. A computer program and algorithm targeted every policyholder recently diagnosed with HIV for an automatic fraud investigation, as the company searched for any pretext to revoke their policy. As was the case with Mitchell, their insurance policies often were canceled on erroneous information, the flimsiest of evidence, or for no good reason at all, according to the court documents and interviews with state and federal investigators.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The revelations come at a time when President Barack Obama, in his frantic push to rescue the administration's health care plan, has stepped up his criticism of insurers. The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to vote later this week on an overhaul of the health system, which Obama has said is essential to do away with controversial and unpopular industry practices.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Insurance companies have long engaged in the practice of "rescission," whereby they investigate policyholders shortly after they've been diagnosed with life-threatening illnesses. But government regulators and investigators who have overseen the actions of Assurant and other health insurance companies say it is unprecedented for a company to single out people with HIV.
                                    </p>

                                    That point should be emphasized: the current health care legislation would outlaw the practice of rescission -&nbsp;make it illegal for insurance companies to do this under any circumstances (even when there was a pre-existing condition).&nbsp;&nbsp;One obvious retort is that what Fortis did in this case is already illegal, hence Mitchell won his case.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p dir="ltr">
                                    True, but because rescission is currently&nbsp;allowed in a broad set of circumstnaces, insurance companies engage in overly&nbsp;broad sweeps of rescission knowing that either: (a) they have a&nbsp;valid basis for rescission due to a technicality or pre-existing condition; (b) the customer will get discouraged and drop the matter; or (c) the customer will die before there is a resolution of the matter (as with HIV sufferers, they need to locate a source of treatment while the litigation drags on or...they die).&nbsp; Thus, leaving rescission as a viable option creates a nightmare of a health insurance system.
                                </p>
                                <p dir="ltr">
                                    But wait, it gets worse:
                                </p>

                                        "There was evidence that Fortis' general counsel insisted years ago that members of the rescission committee not record the identity of the persons present and involved in the process of making a decision to rescind a Fortis health insurance policy," Nettles wrote.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Elsewhere in his order, Nettles noted that there were no "minutes of actions, votes, or any business conducted during the rescission committee's meeting."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The South Carolina Supreme Court, in upholding the jury's verdict in the case in a unanimous 5-0 opinion, said that it agreed with the lower court's finding that Fortis destroyed records to hide the corporation's misconduct. Supreme Court Chief Justice Jean Hoefer Toal wrote: "The lack of written rescission policies, the lack of information available regarding appealing rights or procedures, the separate policies for rescission documents" as well as the "omission" of other records regarding the decision to revoke Mitchell's insurance, constituted "evidence that Fortis tried to conceal the actions it took in rescinding his policy."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In affirming the trial verdict and Nettles' order, Toal was as harsh in her criticism of the company as Judge Nettles had been. "We find ample support in the record that Fortis' conduct was reprehensible," she wrote. "Fortis demonstrated an indifference to Mitchell's life and a reckless disregard to his health and safety."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Fortis canceled Mitchell's health insurance based on a single erroneous note from a nurse in his medical records that indicated that he might have been diagnosed prior to his obtaining his insurance policy. When the company's investigators discovered the note, they ceased further review of Mitchell's records for evidence to the contrary, including the records containing the doctor's diagnosis.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Nettles also suggested that Fortis should have realized the date in the note was incorrect: "Not only did Fortis choose to rely on one false and unreliable snippet of information containing an erroneous date to the exclusion of other information which would have revealed that date to be erroneous, Fortis refused to conduct any further investigation even after it was on notice the evidence which aroused its suspicion to be false," the judge noted.
                                    </p>

                                    But surely this is an isolated incident, right?
                                </p>

                                        But state regulators, federal and congressional investigators, and consumer advocates say that in only a tiny percentage of cases of people who have had their health insurance canceled was there a legitimate reason.
                                    </p>

                                        A 2007 investigation by a California state regulatory agency, the California Department of Managed Health Care, bore this out. The DMHC randomly selected 90 instances in which Anthem Blue Cross of California, one of WellPoint's largest subsidiaries, canceled the insurance of policy holders after diagnoses with costly or life-threatening illnesses to determine how many were legally justified.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The result: The agency concluded that Anthem Blue Cross lacked legal grounds for canceling policies in every single instance.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        "In all 90 files, there was no evidence (that Blue Cross), before rescinding coverage, investigated or established that the applicant's omission/misrepresentation was willful," the DMHC report said.
