                            <p>
                                In recent years the US has begun to lag in education for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and a number of efforts are underway to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/03/fixing-us-stem-education-is-possible-but-will-take-money.ars" title="Ars Technica: Fixing US STEM education is possible, but will take money">address this issue</a>. We know that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/02/hands-on-learning-key-kids-interest-in-scitechmath-fields.ars" title="Ars Technica: Hands-on learning key to kids' interest in sci/tech fields">giving kids hands-on experience</a> is one of the best ways to spark and keep their interest in STEM-related fields, and to this end, high schoolers all over the country are getting an opportunity to learn and apply STEM knowledge by participating in the annual <a href="http://www.rubegoldberg.com/" title="Rube Goldberg">Rube Goldberg Machine Contest</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rube Goldberg, who was himself an engineer, is most famous for his cartoons that depicted contrived, complex contraptions for executing the most mundane tasks. The cartoons were meant to serve as a criticism for the encroachment of technology in our lives during the early part of the 20th century, and the tendency to favor "exerting maximum effort to achieve minimal results." Rube Goldberg machines, named in honor of these cartoons, typically involve complex arrangements of levers, pulleys, balloons, ball bearings, mouse traps, and other mechanical means that could accomplish something as simple as starting a phonograph.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Perhaps the most recent example of a Rube Goldberg machine in pop culture was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w" title="YouTube: OK Go - This To Shall Pass">featured in a recent video</a> by the band OK Go. Known for their unusual and widely viewed music videos, the band spent 5 months with a team of as many as 60 engineers and designers to create an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/03/ok-go-rube-goldberg/" title="Wired: How OK Goâ€™s Amazing Rube Goldberg Machine Was Built">synced to its song</a> "This Too Shall Pass." The machine ultimately shoots colored paint out of air cannons and all over the band members at the end of the four-minute song.

                                In 1949, two engineering fraternities at Purdue University began a competition to devise the most complex machine to accomplish a given goal. That competition lasted for six years, but was later revived by one of the fraternities in 1983. The competition culminated in the first national Rube Goldberg Machine Contest in 1988, and it has been <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/rubegoldberg/index.html" title="Purdue University News Service: Rube Goldberg Contest at Purdue">held at Purdue ever since</a>. In 2007, high schools were permitted to participate in the national contest for the first time, giving kids as young as 14 exposure to one of the most exciting and diabolical engineering competitions ever.

                                Having grown up in the same city as Purdue University, I got to witness several collegiate national competitions, including the classics, "put coins in a bank, toast a slice of bread" and "squeeze the juice from an orange." This year's goal was to create a machine that can dispense hand sanitizer in no less than 20 steps. I had the incredible opportunity to serve as a judge for a Chicago-area regional high school competition held recently at <a href="http://www.prosseracademy.org/">Prosser Career Academy</a>. Five schools competed for a chance to go on to compete at the national contest at Purdue on March 27, including one school that traveled all the way from North Carolina.

                                Competition builds better engineers
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The teams competing included Prosser and <a href="http://jonescollegeprep.org/">Jones College Prep</a> from the Chicago Public Schools system, <a href="http://www.niles-hs.k12.il.us/West">Niles West High School</a> and <a href="http://www.csd99.org/north/">Downers Grove North High School</a> from the suburbs, and <a href="http://www.rivermilljags.org/">River Mill Academy</a> from Graham, North Carolina. Schools normally compete in a local regional competition, and advisor Sandi Daigle told Ars that the Rivermill team had originally planned to compete in Knoxville, Tennessee. However, only River Mill and a team from Knoxville were registered for that event, and the rules require at least three teams to compete to move on to nationals. "It was either here, Las Vegas, or Korea," she said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Funding seemed to be a big concern for most of the schools participating. "Our school is tinyâ€”we don't even have bells," Daigle told Ars. "We ended up having a parent donate frequent flyer miles to pay for the hotel."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The team from Jones Prep had an even bigger budget constraint: $0. The science budget only included enough money for the entry fee for the regional competition; the machine itself had to be built using only materials in advisor Alexis Kovacs' Physics lab. "Using what we could find, including cardboard and duct tape, we built a pretty good Rube Goldberg machine without buying anything fancy," Kovacs told Ars.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The machine also included masses from a balance set, physics text books, astronomy board games, the ever-popular series of dominos, a vintage motorized solar system model, and trash cans "appropriated" from the school's sixth floor. The team did admit to pooling loose change to buy water balloons, however.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "I think it makes it more challenging," Kovacs said, "but I think in the end the kids feel better about themselves about having built something that didn't require buying anything."

                                The teams were all built from membership in a science or engineering club, and most noted that the Rube Goldberg competition gave them a directed goal to work towards throughout the school year. "We don't have a lot of extra-curricular&nbsp;activities," River Mill's Daigle told Ars, "and I said, 'Hey, I'm interested in starting an engineering club.' The Rube Goldberg contest gave us something to do in the club, as opposed to sitting around and tinkering with stuff."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most of the teacher/advisors agreed that giving kids a hands-on opportunity was a critical aspect of participating in the competition. "It's a great way to get kids who might otherwise be intimidated by the math or hard science involved and interested in STEM," Kovacs said. "For those that are already interested in science or engineering fields, this helps them be able to solve real problems and really use their hands."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Downer Grove North's Jeff Grant agreed, noting that the competition helped his students to see their ideas turned into something tangible. "I think that's super vital," he told Ars. "There's just no opportunity to do something like this in the classroom."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Teamwork and the team-building experience were also considered important aspects of the competition. Niles West advisor Ben Brzezinski told Ars that working as a team will be a skill that the students will use for the rest of their lives. "Wherever they end up, they are going to have to work as a team to build things, whether they go into engineering or any other field," he said. "There definitely has to be a sort of synergy there, as well as leadership, and camaraderie."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That camaraderie is something that River Mill team member Joshua Crumb valued most. "It's a great bondâ€”you have eight or so people that you might honestly never talk to, and by the end we're all like family," he told Ars.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Prosser advisor and competition organizer Nathan Dolenc said that getting to know his students better was his number-one priority, something he felt many teachers miss out on. "Yes, it's about making the machine work, but it's also about the journey getting there," he told Ars. "Hopefully, some of my lessons rub off on them."
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                The Machines
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Jones Prep's machine was, as previously stated, extremely spartan. However, the team was able to have two successful runs without requiring any student intervention. Teams earn 20 points for successfully completing the goal, but get dinged three points every time a student has to touch part of the machine to keep it going. "I'm really happy, because last year we didn't have any successful runs," Kovacs said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Team member Brian Gardas was thrilled with the machine's performance. "We wanted to include more steps than 20, but we had to go with the bare minimum because of what we had to work with," he said. The team struggled to put together the various objects they had scrapped from all over their lab. For the three days prior to the competition, several steps just would not work. "But just yesterday," Gardas told Ars, "we were able to get them to work. It was even more impressive given the materials we had at hand, and it really felt good that we got it working."

                                        River Mill's machine had two swirling networks of paths built completely out of construction paper, through which glass marbles raced along.

                                River Mill's machine was dominated by intricate paper-craft pathways, along which a series of marbles traveled throughout the machine to activate a toy car, set a pair of scissors to cut a wire, or trip a spring. However, the delicacy proved to be a problem when it came to transporting the machine in a van for 13 hours.
                            </p>

                                "All of our problems were a result of the travel," team member Crumb told Ars. "Some things were brokenâ€”our last step had to be completely changed at the last minuteâ€”and almost everything got crushed."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The team ended up getting numerous penalty points for having to intervene in the machine's operation so much. "But we were able to pull it off, and I'm proud that we were able to do that," Crumb said.

                                        The team from Downers Grove North included some K'nex, a splash guard, and a magical Pegasus in their machine.

                                Downers Grove North had two mostly successful runs, but their machine lacked polish. A late start getting a team together didn't leave time for refining. "We didn't have much time to test it and work out all the kinks, but we got a working machine here, and we only had one intervention," team member Xander MacCrane told Ars. "I call that a success."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If there was one thing he could have changed, it would have been to make the entire machine more sturdy. Also, "we had a lot of steps that we could have gotten to work if we tried," MacCrane said.
                            </p>

                                Prosser's entry was far and away the most ambitious and impressive, and was an early favorite. The official competition rules require the machine to fit in a 6ft x 6ft x 6ft space, and the Prosser team managed to use almost every bit of that space to jam representations of nearly every Chicago landmark of note, including the Sears Tower, a light-up John Hancock building, a model House of Blues that blasted "Sweet Home Chicago," wooden model CTA trains, and the iconic Chicago River, dyed green as it is every St Patrick's Day.

                                (Seriously, it had Upper and Lower Wacker drive, Chicago Bears tickets, a Chicago Bulls jersey, a 1933 World's Fair poster, and Lake Shore Drive winding around an aquarium that stood in for Lake Michigan. This was all framed by a giant scale model of the marquee of the famous Chicago Theatre.)

                                Teams are partially judged based on theme, Rube Goldberg "spirit" and Rube Goldberg "style." In a sense, the crazier the theme, the wackier the steps, and the more complexity you can manage, the more points you can earn. Prosser had all of these in abundance. Their machine had 59 individual stepsâ€”nearly triple the minimumâ€”and the theme involved the "Dark Knight" sweeping through Chicago to root out political corruption. In a bit of surprising wit, the team members all wore masks of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, the team learned that complexity can kill an otherwise great machine. Team captain Wojtek Karwowski told Ars that a solar panel intended to power a small boat proved problematic. "We tried adding batteries with more voltage, but then the boat sunk a little and tipped over," he said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Prosser also suffered from a number of penalties for interventions, and lost a few points when some of the moving parts dropped outside of the machine's platform. "Everything went really smooth, until we moved our machine to the competition," Karwowski said. "Then we had problems."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let that be a lesson to future competitors: you have to engineer for the machine to travel, be disassembled and reassembled, and possibly work under non-ideal conditions. (Consider: the original iBook was designed to remain functional after dropping from a height of three feetâ€”the average height of a school desk.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The final team competing, Niles West, also had a Chicago-themed design, with fairly accurate models of the Sears Tower, John Hancock Building, and the Smurfit-Stone Building (made famous in the 80s teen classic <em>Adventures in Babysitting</em>) fashioned solidly from medium-density fiberboard. The machine also had an impressive catapult that shot a ball bearing all the way across the machine's six foot width (which I felt was worth a few extra style points).

                                The team struggled with some stubborn mouse traps used to trigger a number of steps, and lost a few points due to some wayward ball bearings. But otherwise they turned in a solid performance. Team member Danny Lohan was happy with the experience of putting the machine together. "My takeaway is the experience of creating ideas, fixing them, getting things to work, going back and checking the machine over," he told Ars.

                                As we noted, River Mill was stymied by travel-related issues, and Downers Grove North lacked polish. Prosser's impressive machine fell prey to reliability issues, and was killed by complexity. Niles West had a solid entry, and with few interventions they were able to score a second place trophy.

                                However, Jones Prep managed to use the KISS principle and dedication to turn their handicap of zero budget into an advantage. The team's work resulted in a flawlessly performing Rube Goldberg machine, which earned them enough points to take home the first place trophy. "Working with different materials, getting them all to work together, and incorporating it with physics, it's kind of cool to see how these things apply in real life," Gradas told Ars. "It's cool to be able to apply what you've learned."

                                The team is preparing to travel to Purdue at the end of March to compete in the national competition. "In engineering, you just have to keep working at a problem until it's solved; this competition helps build the students' stamina for that," Kovacs said. And even if the team doesn't take the national title this year, it plans to learn everything it can from teams from around the country. "Next year, I think we'll be able to do even better."

                            <p>
                                If you think participation in programs like the Rube Goldberg Machine Contest provides good educational experiences for young minds, chances are a school in your area could use your help. I&nbsp;served as a judge for the competition at Prosser along with several employees of the STEM curio emporium <a href="http://www.sciplus.com/" title="American Science &amp; Surplus">American Science &amp; Surplus</a>, several members of an area STEM education program, a surgical instructor from an area VA hospital, and a mechanical engineer from design firm IDEO. This experience alone can be rewardingâ€”your feedback and encouragement could prove useful for the team that goes on to nationals, or for those that go back to the drawing board to compete the next year. The teams are supposed to clearly explain to the judges how their machines work, and the judging criteria doesn't require any specific technical knowledge, so practically anyone can serve as a judge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you do have specialized technical knowledge or fabrication skills, however, you could volunteer to be a mentor to a team. If your local school doesn't have a science or engineering club that might form the basis of a team (at most, 12 students plus one teacher/advisor), you might help form one. You could help your local school organize and host a regional competition.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And despite President Obama's initiative to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-education-innovate-campaign" title="The White House: Remarks by the President on the 'Education To Innovate' Campaign">fund more STEM education programs</a>, it's a good bet that your local school could use some money for its STEM programs. For a team competing in a Rube Goldberg competition, that means entry fees, travel costs, and supplies and tools to build a machine. Or, if you work at a company that could do so, perhaps you could arrange for a donation of materials to build a machine. You'd be surprised what could come in handy: toys, batteries, wood, PVC pipe, funnels, switches, metal rods, ball bearings, weights, levers, fans paint, etc.
