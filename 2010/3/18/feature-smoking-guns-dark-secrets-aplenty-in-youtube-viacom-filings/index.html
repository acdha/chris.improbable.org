                            <p>
                                Court documents in the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2007/03/viacom-sues-youtube-for-copyright-infringement.ars">$1 billion lawsuit</a> between Viacom and YouTube were unsealed today, finally shedding some light on key questions: did Viacom have "smoking gun" evidence that YouTube was deliberately profiting from 62,637 Viacom clips that were watched more than 507 million times on the site? Was Google aware of the copyright infringement problems when it purchased YouTube in 2006? Were YouTube's own founders involved in uploading unauthorized materials?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On all three counts, Viacom says yes—and it offers up a host of e-mails to prove it:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>"In a July 19, 2005 e-mail to YouTube co-founders Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen wrote: 'jawed, please stop putting stolen videos on the site. We’re going to have a tough time defending the fact that we’re not liable for the copyrighted material on the site because we didn’t put it up when one of the co-founders is blatantly stealing content from other sites and trying to get everyone to see it.'"
                                </li>
                                <li>"Chen twice wrote that 80 percent of user traffic depended on pirated videos. He opposed removing infringing videos on the ground that 'if you remove the potential copyright infringements... site traffic and virality will drop to maybe 20 percent of what it is.' Karim proposed they 'just remove the obviously copyright infringing stuff.' But Chen again insisted that even if they removed only such obviously infringing clips, site traffic would drop at least 80 percent. ('if [we] remove all that content[,] we go from 100,000 views a day down to about 20,000 views or maybe even lower')."
                                </li>
                                <li>"In response to YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley’s August 9, 2005 e-mail, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen stated: 'but we should just keep that stuff on the site. I really don’t see what will happen. what? someone from cnn sees it? he happens to be someone with power? he happens to want to take it down right away. he get in touch with cnn legal. 2 weeks later, we get a cease &amp; desist letter. we take the video down.'"
                                </li>
                                <li>"A true smoking gun is a memorandum personally distributed by founder Karim to YouTube’s entire board of directors at a March 22, 2006 board meeting. Its words are pointed, powerful, and unambiguous. Karim told the YouTube board point-blank: 'As of today episodes and clips of the following well-known shows can still be found: Family Guy, South Park, MTV Cribs, Daily Show, Reno 911, Dave Chapelle. This content is an easy target for critics who claim that copyrighted content is entirely responsible for YouTube’s popularity. Although YouTube is not legally required to monitor content (as we have explained in the press) and complies with DMCA takedown requests, we would benefit from preemptively removing content that is blatantly illegal and likely to attract criticism.'"
                                </li>
                                <li>"A month later, [YouTube manager Maryrose] Dunton told another senior YouTube employee in an instant message that 'the truth of the matter is probably 75-80 percent of our views come from copyrighted material.' She agreed with the other employee that YouTube has some 'good original content' but 'it’s just such a small percentage.'"
                                </li>
                                <li>"In a September 1, 2005 email to YouTube co-founder Steve Chen and all YouTube employees, YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim stated, 'well, we SHOULD take down any: 1) movies 2) TV shows. we should KEEP: 1) news clips 2) comedy clips (Conan, Leno, etc) 3) music videos. In the future, I’d also reject these last three but not yet.'"
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                The limits of the DMCA
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The basic argument here is a simple one. YouTube's founders hoped to build a massive user base as quickly as possible and then sell the site. "Our dirty little secret... is that we actually just want to sell out quickly," said Karim at one point. In an e-mail, Chen talked about “concentrat[ing] all of our efforts in building up our numbers as aggressively as we can through whatever tactics, however evil.”
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                As the e-mails collected in this suit make clear, numerous YouTube employees had direct knowledge of infringing material on the site, and in fact even altered tools like the community "flagging" feature so as to purposely find out about fewer incidents.
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                The strategy worked. One-and-one-half years after launching, Google purchased YouTube and made all of the founders incredibly wealthy. Given the obvious appeal of unauthorized content on YouTube, Viacom argues that the startup's strategy was, at its core, a decision to profit from copyright infringement. It doesn't matter whether YouTube showed ads on its video pages or not (for years, it did not, apparently concerned about just this issue); to Viacom, the entire business strategy was a way of profiting from infringement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That's important because the Digital Millennium Copyright Act protects service providers that engage in "storage at the direction of the user." It has been a huge boon to user-generated content sites, and it is YouTube's key defense. But the DMCA puts limits on the generous safe harbors it provides: operators cannot have actual knowledge of infringement, they must take down infringing materials when asked, and they cannot profit from the infringement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the very first sentence of the summary judgment motion, Viacom makes clear it will attack YouTube's safe harbor protection head-on: "Plaintiffs Viacom International Inc. et al. (“Viacom”) move for partial summary judgment on Defendants’ liability for copyright infringement and concurrently to invalidate Defendants’ reliance on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) as a defense to that infringement."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Viacom argues that YouTube did know about infringement on the site, and not just in a general, "surely there's some infringement going on here" sort of way. No, as the e-mails collected in this suit make clear, numerous YouTube employees had direct knowledge of infringing material on the site, and in fact even altered tools like the community "flagging" feature so as to purposely find out about fewer incidents.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Under this argument, YouTube is like Grokster, the P2P site whose case went all the way to the Supreme Court and resulted in a seminal ruling that shut down the site on the grounds that the huge majority of its activity produced infringement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But there's a second argument. Viacom also claims that YouTube is not covered by the law for a more fundamental reason: it is not engaged in "storage," as a file locker might be, but is in the business of displaying and broadcasting content, which also includes making numerous back-end copies. This behavior involves YouTube in "direct infringement of copyrights."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This appears to be the weakest part of Viacom's case, and it's unclear why the company would bother making it in the wake of a federal court's <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/01/judge-transcoding-doesnt-block-veoh-safe-harbor-defense.ars">recent Veoh ruling</a>. That decision noted (correctly, in our view) that automated back-end processes to cache or transcode or display a video did not involve the site operator in such direct infringement.
                            </p>

                                A curious case of amnesia
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The story of how this material came to light is itself an intriguing one. Key e-mails from YouTube's founders were not produced by YouTube, which claimed to have lost them. Much of the material in the suit comes from co-founder Jawed Karim, who "preserved these materials on his own personal computer, discharged his duties to [the] Court and produced them. Otherwise they would have never surfaced in this litigation."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Clearly, Viacom is suspicious about what happened, and its suspicion is not just directed at YouTube but also at its corporate parent, Google. Google CEO Eric Schmidt was asked to produce a host of e-mails and documents about the decision to purchase YouTube, and Schmidt came up with... 19 documents for the $1.8 billion deal.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                For years, Viacom continuously and secretly uploaded its content to YouTube, even while publicly complaining about its presence there.
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Other executives practiced "similar bizarre practices." YouTube co-founder Chad Hurely "developed serial amnesia" when asked about Karim's e-mail chains. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "This is no lawyer’s exaggeration," writes Viacom. "We include pages 177-317 of Mr. Hurley’s testimony and invite the Court to review it. To the same effect is the testimony of Larry Page, one of Google’s two co-founders and top three executives, who essentially disclaimed memory on any topic relevant to this litigation, even including, for example, whether he was in favor of Google’s acquisition of YouTube, even though it was Google’s largest corporate transaction to date and viewed as transformative to its business... This Court can decide whether these key executives and witnesses behaved with the level of candor and respect for the legal process that this Court has a right to expect from senior executives of important public companies."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's not an outright accusation of deceit, but it comes pretty close.

                                Google's "high-tech extortion"
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Viacom wanted information from Google, because it hoped to show that the company knew exactly what it was doing when it purchased YouTube and that it was fully aware of the site's copyright issues. To that end, Viacom produced numerous documents, including a Google memorandum from the Google Video team about YouTube. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The team told senior Google execs that YouTube was "a ‘rogue enabler’ of content theft," that its "content is all free, and much of it is highly sought after pirated clips," and that "YouTube’s business model is completely sustained by pirated content."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In May 2006, Ethan Anderson, international business product manager for Google Video, told other execs, "I can’t believe you’re recommending buying YouTube... they’re 80 percent illegal pirated content.” Schmidt, when asked about it, couldn't recall discussions of "piracy" on the site.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition, Viacom says that it was essentially extorted by Google after the sale. For a while, the two companies were in negotiations over a content licensing deal that would also have covered all past infringement. Google offered a $590 million deal to Viacom that included an offer to use fingerprinting technology to block unauthorized uploads of Viacom material. When the deal fell apart, Google refused to use the fingerprinting technology for Viacom "in the absence of a license agreement."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Viacom called the move "high-tech extortion" and saw it as a way for Google to pressure rightsholders into licensing deals. Google eventually relented and implemented fingerprinting technology for companies that would not license content, but not until 2008.

                                Google dissents from every one of these arguments, and then drops a few bombshells of its own. Saying that Viacom misconstrued "isolated lines from a handful of e-mails," Google goes on the warpath:

                                    For years, Viacom continuously and secretly uploaded its content to YouTube, even while publicly complaining about its presence there. It hired no fewer than 18 different marketing agencies to upload its content to the site. It deliberately "roughed up" the videos to make them look stolen or leaked. It opened YouTube accounts using phony email addresses. It even sent employees to Kinko's to upload clips from computers that couldn't be traced to Viacom. And in an effort to promote its own shows, as a matter of company policy Viacom routinely left up clips from shows that had been uploaded to YouTube by ordinary users. Executives as high up as the president of Comedy Central and the head of MTV Networks felt "very strongly" that clips from shows like The Daily Show and The Colbert Report should remain on YouTube.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Viacom's efforts to disguise its promotional use of YouTube worked so well that even its own employees could not keep track of everything it was posting or leaving up on the site. As a result, on countless occasions Viacom demanded the removal of clips that it had uploaded to YouTube, only to return later to sheepishly ask for their reinstatement. In fact, some of the very clips that Viacom is suing us over were actually uploaded by Viacom itself.

                                    Given Viacom’s own actions, there is no way YouTube could ever have known which Viacom content was and was not authorized to be on the site. But Viacom thinks YouTube should somehow have figured it out.

                                The argument here rests on the fact that all books, music, and videos are automatically copyrighted in the US at the moment of their creation. This was a change introduced in the 1976 Copyright Act, one that did away with the need to register a work in order to gain copyright protection. The upshot of this change is that nearly every single item on YouTube is copyrighted; the real question is not whether the clips are copyrighted, but whether they are "authorized" by the rightsholder for display on YouTube.

                                Because Viacom was involved in using YouTube for promotional use, Google lawyers point out that YouTube employees had no way of knowing whether any particular clip was authorized or not. Clips don't carry legal authorization information. Even if it was clear (and it was) that many of the clips on the site were copyrighted, YouTube insists that it could not know in advance whether those clips were authorized.

                                This isn't "turning a blind eye to infringement," in Google's view; it is simply a practical reality. Instead, YouTube relied (and continues to rely) on rightsholders to send it takedown notices as specified in the DMCA. Sure, this placed a huge burden on rightsholders, especially since Google required a separate letter for every infringing URL and would not prevent the re-uploading of the same material by other users, but it was the only way the company could know if authorization for a specific clip had been granted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Viacom had even hired marketers to confuse the issue of authorization. These marketers "lack[ed] any discernable connection to Viacom" and use account names like "MysticalGirl8" and "Demansr." Viacom "has deliberately used email addresses that 'can’t be traced to [Viacom]' when registering for YouTube accounts," says YouTube, and "Viacom employees have made special trips away from the company’s premises (to places like Kinko’s) to upload videos to YouTube from computers not traceable to Viacom."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition, "Viacom has altered its own videos to make them appear stolen, like 'footage from the cutting room floor, so users feel they have found something unique.'" The final result, says Google, is that there's just no way to tell, short of a notice from the company, what works must be taken down.

                                The situation was so confusing that Viacom lawyers weren't able to fully identify which clips were authorized and which were not for this lawsuit; Viacom even had its own YouTube account suspended over confused copyright notices.

                            <blockquote>
                                This fact is powerfully demonstrated by examining the countless errors that Viacom and many other content owners make in sending takedown notices to YouTube. YouTube routinely received takedown requests that were subsequently withdrawn after the media companies who sent them realized that their notices had been targeted to content that they themselves had uploaded or authorized. ­Both before and well into this litigation, Viacom’s own monitoring agent, BayTSP, identified as “infringing” many videos that had in fact been posted to YouTube with Viacom’s permission. These self­-inflicted infringement claims led to counter­notices from Viacom’s marketers, sheepish retractions from BayTSP, and even to the suspension of Viacom’s own authorized YouTube accounts for supposed copyright violations.

                                In Google's view, Viacom made use of the service, confused the issue of authorization, and is now trying to subvert the DMCA. "YouTube and sites like it will cease to exist in their current form if Viacom and others have their way in their lawsuits against YouTube," Google warned darkly in a blog post today.
                            </p>

                                Viacom says that its marketing wasn't that confusing. "This whole exercise is a red herring. First, none of the infringing clips at issue in this lawsuit were uploaded to YouTube by Viacom or its authorized agents. Second, the number of uploads to YouTube that Viacom did authorize (for which Viacom is not suing for infringement) was very limited compared to the 63,000 unauthorized infringing clips claimed by Viacom in this litigation. Third, of that small number of authorized clips, virtually all were uploaded to YouTube using official Viacom account names, and YouTube was fully aware of this fact."

                                Both sides have asked the judge for summary judgment based on the undisputed facts of the case.
