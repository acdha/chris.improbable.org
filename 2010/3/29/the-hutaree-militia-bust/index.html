                        <blockquote>
                            Anent the discussion that's been going on in the <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/012277.html">Kristallnacht Revisited</a> thread: over this past weekend, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/us/30militia.html?src=me">the FBI and ATF conducted raids in Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio</a>, arresting eight members of Hutaree, a Michigan-based Christian militia group. A ninth member is still at large. They've been indicted for seditious conspiracy, attempting to use weapons of mass destruction, teaching/demonstrating the use of explosive materials, and carrying, using, and possessing firearms in relation to a crime of violence.
                            <p>
                                Elevator pitch version: The Hutaree militia, an anti-government extremist organization, headquartered in (but by no means limited to) Michigan, advocates violence against local, state and federal law enforcement. It views them as "foot soldiers" for the federal government and a sinister "New World Order," both of which the Hutaree identifies with the Antichrist. Government prosecutors are alleging that the Hutaree plotted to murder a law enforcement officer, set off a high-powered explosive device at the officer's funeral in order to kill more law enforcement officers, hole up at prearranged fortified "rally points," and issue a general call for an anti-government uprising.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some of the riches of the web: here's the government's <a href="http://detroit.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel10/de032910.htm">press release</a>. TPM has the <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/03/feds_release_details_in_hutaree_arrests.php">basic story plus mug shots</a>. The BBC has a picture of Hutaree's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8593975.stm">unit insignia</a>. The "CCR" stands for "Colonial Christian Republic." CBS has a photo swiped from Hutaree's website showing members in their <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20001329-504083.html">cammie jammies</a>. Hutaree's website is currently inaccessible, but their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/hutaree#p/u/3/Apmn9xMxiZ4">YouTube channel</a> is still up. TPM has watched the videos, and points out that "Pale Horse," one of the men arrested, put up a video <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/03/our_country_is_in_peril_accused_hutaree_member_pos.php">warning citizens to arm themselves</a> shortly before Obama was elected. The Southern Poverty Law Center noticed the video when it went up, and <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2009/04/24/ohio-militia-calls-for-armed-march-on-washington/">expressed concern</a>. (The <a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100329/NEWS05/100329048/1001/NEWS/Experts-Christian-militia-part-of-growing-trend&amp;template=fullarticle">Detroit Free Press</a> and the <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/0329/Hutaree-militia-arrests-point-to-tripling-of-militias-since-2008">Christian Science Monitor</a> agree with them.) Hutaree also put up a video showing them <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/03/christian_militia_group_burns_un_flag_in_youtube_v.php">burning a UN flag</a>. This is in line with an article that was on their site, "10 Horns of the European Super State, Mr. Europe and 7 years of peace in Israel," which you can still find <a href="http://andrewhammel.typepad.com/german_joys/2010/03/is-javier-solana-the-antichrist.html">summarized here</a> and <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message285968/pg1">reproduced without permission</a> there. (I recommend the summarized version. Central argument: Javier Solana may be the Antichrist!) Here's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080429220015/http://hutaree.com/">a partial version of Hutaree's website on Wayback</a>. Also on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://hutaree.com/">Wayback</a>: Hutaree's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080123042714/www.hutaree.com/doctrine.htm">religious doctrine</a>, which doesn't say much about them. And Hutaree's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080607094140/www.hutaree.com/rank.html">rank system</a>, which is bizarre: Gunner, Senior Gunner, Master Gunner, Lukore, Bronze Rifleman, Silver Rifleman, Gold Rifleman, Arkon, Zulif, Boramander, and Radok. Jim's not in a position to check, but he thinks the weird ones might be borrowed from the Enochian system (which as you know, Bob, was invented by Edward Kelly when he was trying to get into John Dee's bank account and Mrs. Dee's pants.) (<b>Update!</b> <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=2214#comment-62715">"Justin" in the comment thread at Language Log</a> has this one nailed: <i>"According to http://www.hutaree.com/forum/read.php?12,140,140 , Hutaree's from a conlang of what I assume is one of the followers. It means 'Christian Warrior'. I'd gather that the other ranks are from the same conlang."</i> He quotes an entry from the Hutaree forum by one RD-Merzonik, February 20, 2009 06:43AM, which says, <i>"The word Hutaree, is from our own dilect, there are only about 4 people in the world that know this language, of course me being 1,lol."</i> This makes me feel very cheerful about having described their nomenclature <i>(vide infra)</i> as "bad fantasy slush names.")
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I very nearly digress. (Did I mention that Wikipedia has referred the Hutaree entry to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Hutaree">articles for deletion</a>? Never mind.) Onward.

                                Michigan is oversupplied with militia groups, but insofar as militia enthusiasts have been heard from, they're busily <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/03/28/national/main6342204.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody">distancing themselves</a> from the Hutaree:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                Michael Lackomar, a spokesman for the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia, said one of his team leaders got a frantic phone call Saturday evening from members of Hutaree, a Christian militia group, who said their property in southwest Michigan was being raided by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
                                <p>
                                    "They said they were under attack by the ATF and wanted a place to hide," Lackomar said. "My team leader said, 'no thanks.' "
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>Lackomar allowed that while eight or ten Hutaree members <i>had</i> trained with the SMVM twice in the past three years (SMVM holds monthly "survival training and shooting practice" sessions), none of the raids had focused on his group. He also pronounced Hutaree's alleged methods "despicable."
                            <p>
                                How big is the Hutaree? Good question. Three datapoints: first, it was a three-state raid. Second, Telegraph.co.uk <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/7533921/Christian-militia-group-members-arrested-by-FBI.html">interviewed one of the neighbors</a>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                On Saturday, agents swarmed a rural, wooded property belonging to the group, about 70 miles southwest of Detroit. Phyllis Brugger, who has lived in the area for more than 30 years, said some people who lived there were known as having ties to militia. They would shoot guns and often wore camouflage, according to Mrs Brugger and her daughter, Heidi Wood.
                                <p>
                                    "Everybody knew they were militia," she said. "You don't mess with them."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    About a month ago, 50 vehicles showed up on the property, and the women said neighbours assumed something bad was going on.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>Needless to say, that many cars implies a sizeable organization. Third, there's this bit from the indictment (so remember to say "alleged"):
                            <blockquote>
                                On or about February 6, 2010, several conspirators attempted to travel to Kentucky to attend a summit of militia groups convened by DAVID BRIAN STONE. ... The purpose of the summit of militia groups was to facilitate better communications, cooperation, and coordination between the various militias.
                            </blockquote>The group's exact size must remain indeterminate, but we're not looking at a case of <i>folie à neuf ou dix.</i>
                            <p>
                                Are the Hutaree religious extremists or anti-government extremists? I'd say the latter. Their religious doctrine is barely there. They may talk a lot about Jesus, but their timing and plans appear to be driven by secular concerns.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The clearest account of the government's case is the indictment itself.

Some HUTAREE members are identifiable by their tiger stripe camouflage uniforms with a distinct shoulder patch which contains a black cross, two brown vertical pillars which form the letter "H" in combination with the black cross, two red spears, a brown V shape at the base of the cross symbolizing the supporting hands of the HUTAREE, and the initials "CCR."

                                    Since at least 2008, the HUTAREE has been meeting regularly to conduct military-style training in Lenawee County, located in the Eastern District of Michigan, and elsewhere. The purpose of this training has been to plan and prepare for the impending war with the HUTAREE's enemies.

                            </blockquote>Various parties--Firedoglake comes to mind--have been complaining that the government is charging the Hutaree with seditious conspiracy and with trying to use WMDs, rather than calling it terrorism. I can think of one really good reason to do that. "Terrorism" is an inadequately precise and excessively exciting term that makes it hard to pin down what we're talking about. In the years since 9/11 it's been misused and overused like crazy. Why not go back to using the serviceable legal language and concepts that existed long before the planes hit the towers? Terrorism is a tactic. Seditious conspiracy is a definable action.

Another son, defendant DAVID BRIAN STONE, JR. ... served as an explosives instructor and demonstrator, and participated in operational planning and training. The defendant DAVID BRIAN STONE ... also established a HUTAREE rank structure, assigned HUTAREE names to members of the organization, and created HUTAREE words for various military formations and maneuvers.

                                Pay attention to the next paragraph. The Hutaree plan that all the mainstream news sources are citing was only one of their ideas.

                                The general concept of operations provided that the HUTAREE would commit some violent act to draw the attention of law enforcement or government officials and which would prompt a response by law enforcement. Possible such acts which were discussed included killing a member of law enforcement after a traffic stop, killing a member of law enforcement and his or her family at home, ambushing a member of law enforcement in rural communities, luring a member of law enforcement with a false 911 emergency call and then killing him or her, and killing a member of law enforcement and then attacking the funeral procession motorcade with weapons of mass destruction. These acts would intimidate and demoralize law enforcement, diminishing their ranks and rendering them ineffective.
                            </blockquote>These people may be doofuses, but they have ugly imaginations, and they act on them.
                            <blockquote>
                                The general concept of operations further provided that, once such action was taken, HUTAREE members would then retreat to one of several "rally points" where the HUTAREE would wage war against the government and be prepared to defend in depth with trip-wired and command detonated anti-personnel Improvised Explosive Devices (IED), ambushes, and prepared fighting positions. It is believed by the HUTAREE that this engagement would then serve as a catalyst for a more wide-spread uprising against the Government.

Conspirators engaged in military-style training in anticipation of the planned for military operations to include firearms and explosives training, weapons proficiency drills, patrolling and reconnaissance exercises, close quarter battle drills, and "man-down" drills, and prepared defensive fighting positions, ambush kill zones, and storage bunkers. During these training sessions, each conspirator in attendance carried and used at least one firearm. This training has also included instruction and demonstrations regarding the manufacturing and use of destructive devices and weapons of mass destruction.

According to the plan, the HUTAREE would then attack law enforcement vehicles during the funeral procession with Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) with Explosively Formed Projectiles (EFP). Subsequently, and in furtherance of this plan, DAVID BRIAN STONE ... obtained information about such devices over the internet and emailed diagrams of such devices to a person he believed capable of manufacturing the devices. Also, in furtherance of this plan, JOSHUA MATTHEW STONE ... and others provided materials necessary for the manufacturing of such devices at the direction of DAVID BRIAN STONE. ...

I think they were targeted because they're simultaneously the loosest of loose cannons and genuinely dangerous, and the government busted them when they did because they were about to put potentially violent plans into action.
