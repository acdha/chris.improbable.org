                                Most of the talk about future fourth-generation (4G) mobile broadband networks appears to focus on speed. These networks will be far, far faster than current 3G networks. But speed isn't actually the main reason why every carrier in the developed world is trying to extend the life of 3G networks by speeding them up, and build 4G networks as fast as equipment and financing is available. It's all about congestion and capacity, not speed. (In the developing world, 2G networks are being boosted to 3G speeds, too.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "They're not really for speed, they're not really for voice, they're for capacity," said Allen Nogee, a principal analyst at the In-Stat research firm. Overwhelmed network operators need to handle more devices, each of them owned by high-revenue customers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Regardless, this year we have already seen significant 3G network upgrades by AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, the mass-market expansion of Clearwire's 4G WiMax network, and the commercial launch of Verizon's 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) network.
                            </p>

                                What's the road to 4G look like? So far, it's remarkably free of missteps; delay has been the watchword instead of disaster.

                                If you've used an iPhone in San Francisco or New York, I don't have to explain the problem of congestion to you.

                            <p>
                                The iPhone is the flag bearer for mobile networks that were underbuilt and overutilized. AT&amp;T hemmed and hawed, but the company has now quite openly admitted that it wasn't spending enough on its mobile network, particularly on backhaul, and has stepped up tremendously.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are two major parts of a cellular network that handle data relevant to our purposes: the local link, or the wireless connection from your phone, laptop, MiFi router, or other device equipped with mobile broadband, to the nearest cellular base station on a roof or tower; and the backhaul, which connects all the radio gear from a carrier to its core network.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (There are, of course, a whole lot of other components, too, such as the core network, the base station software, the network's interchanges with other networks, and so on, but these pieces have less obvious and direct impact on what an end user experiences.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let's address backhaul first, because it's much simpler. Most cell base stations had relatively paltry backhaul until the last two years, even in dense urban markets. Before 3G started to be heavily used by mobile devices, and for previous 2G networks, a 1.5 Mbps T-1 line or an even slower link (whether wireless or wired) could handle all the voice and data capacity for a carrier. Hundreds of voice calls and multiple data devices wouldn't flood the line.
                            </p>
                            <div>

                                        <em>Generation Gap<br></em> There are four defined generations of cellular technology. 1G was all analog. 2G is digital, with a small provision for data networking at speeds slower than dial-up modems. 2.5G was a stopgap of 100 to 200 Kbps data networking while 3G was finalized and deployed. 3G networks needed to have a raw downstream rate of 2 Mbps or higher, but voice and data traffic are managed separately. 4G networks are ostensibly all Internet protocol with low latency to allow voice and video to work well without extra effort.
                                    </div>

                            <p>
                                But a cellular node can have multiple pieces of gear and handle multiple cellular channels at once. In the 3G-and-beyond world, that could mean devices capable of pulling down 3 to 4 Mbps per channel. A T-1 doesn't cut it, and the move from T-1 to 10 Mbps isn't a smooth one unless the carrier is the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) and it's in an urban area with plenty of wire or fiber.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Carriers have been struggling and investing many billions of dollars to build out fiber or high-speed, high-frequency, point-to-point wireless links to handle the additional backhaul needed. In areas where one carrier has to deal with another—for Sprint and T-Mobile, that's everywhere—it can be even harder.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In a recent interview with T-Mobile, in which the firm announced that a faster 3G flavor was in place (see below), the company said it had paired its new installations with the fastest backhaul it could arrange.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "That's the most complicated part of the upgrade and something we've been at for some time," said Jeremy Korst, a T-Mobile director in charge of broadband products and services. T-Mobile spokesperson David Henderson noted that the new service was a "pretty basic upgrade from a radio side, and then the backhaul is really the biggest gating factor." Fiber and wireless are both being used.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                AT&amp;T seems to agree. <a href="http://www.att.com/gen/press-room?pid=4800&amp;cdvn=news&amp;newsarticleid=30358">While announcing an identical network service</a> upgrade in January, the company said it wouldn't be switching on the faster flavor on the back-end (only on the local link) until it had finished a project to "dramatically increase the number of high-speed backhaul connections to cell sites, primarily with fiber-optic connections."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's odd—possibly even ironic—how wireless networks are so heavily constrained by wires and cables, but that's how the business works.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the local link, there are currently four dominant network standards for 3G and 4G that are deployed or in the process of being deployed: the GSM flavors of 3G HSPA and 4G LTE, CDMA's 3G EVDO Rev. A, and WiMax, which is considered a 4G standard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                GSM network standards, which dominate cellular markets worldwide, have been broken into many incremental improvements, which allowed a lot of stairstepping and retrofitting of 2G and 3G networks. For instance, the so-called 2.5G (a spot between 2G digital and 3G broadband mobile networks) EDGE standard was developed to provide speeds several times faster than 2G data (GPRS) both before 3G could be deployed and in markets where it was cost-prohibitive to build 3G. EDGE was a relatively minor software and hardware upgrade on the base station side, and less expensive to build into handsets and other devices. Apple's very first iPhone could work only as fast as EDGE.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From EDGE (usually 100 to 200 Kbps), networks moved to UMTS (384 Kbps), and then various flavors of paired HSDPA (High Speed Download Packet Access) and HSUPA (the U for Uplink). HSDPA rates commonly deployed are 3.6, 7.2, 14, and 21 Mbps depending on the network; HSUPA rates run from 1.5 Mbps to 6 Mbps on production networks. AT&amp;T has paired HSPDA on nearly all of its phones with UMTS for upstream.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the CDMA side, the US market halts at EVDO Rev. A, even though Qualcomm, CDMA's prime mover, had a Rev. B update and a 4G standard in development. Rev. A tops out at 3.1 Mbps downstream, and 1.8 Mbps upstream. (Rev. B will appear in non-US markets, while Qualcomm's 4G Ultra Mobile Broadband was abandoned.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The two CDMA carriers in the US, Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel, took different 4G courses. Verizon opted for LTE, which it knew would be years away and which it didn't possess the right spectrum for at the time it made its technology decision. Sprint chose WiMax, which was a near-term solution for which it had enough spectrum to deploy right away. Interesting choices in both cases.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'll get to 4G in a moment.

                            <p>
                                In January and February, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile respectively announced that their networks had moved from the 3.6 Mbps to 7.2 Mbps (often called HSPA 7.2) flavor of HSDPA. Both networks have also moved to 2.0 Mbps HSUPA. HSPA 7.2 doubles the local link, and it may have an advantage even without increasing backhaul. With a faster local link, you have less congestion among devices contending to have any communication with a cell base station. That means each device can be more fairly dealt with, even while receiving slender slivers of Internet access.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The rub for both firms is backhaul and coverage. As noted above, T-Mobile and AT&amp;T are both focused on improving backhaul. T-Mobile has a little advantage because the company is building its 3G network fresh with spectrum acquired a few years ago. T-Mobile had no 3G network until May 2008, and now covers over 200 million people in nearly 300 cities with service.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                AT&amp;T has been building 3G service for years, but hasn't built as fast as one might expect. That telco claims it passes—has the ability to offer service to—just 233 million people with its 3G flavor.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For those who can get access, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile will likely shortly be slugging it out for the fastest 3G network. In a series of <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/189592/atandt_roars_back_in_pcworlds_second_3g_wireless_performance_test.html">PCWorld tests conducted by Novarum</a> in December 2009 and January 2010, AT&amp;T had substantially higher speeds than the other three major 3G network providers, including T-Mobile. That's partly due to AT&amp;T's pre-announcement HSPA 7.2 testing. While HSPA 3.6 typically performs in a downstream rate of 700 Kbps to 1.7 Mbps, AT&amp;T claims, HSPA 7.2 can average 1 to 2 Mbps in typical usage based on results from existing deployments.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ken Biba, the founder and chief technology officer of Novarum, said that his firm found spikes of near 4 Mbps in nearly all the 13 cities tested. Average raw TCP downloads—which score better than, say, a Web download—averaged over 3 Mbps for 1 minute in 1 percent of tested cities, and 2.5 Mbps in 10 percent of those cities. (Biba said Novarum has no past or current contracts with carriers to test 3G data performance.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The iPhone 3GS and nine other current AT&amp;T devices use HSPA 7.2, although the company doesn't appear to provide a list. T-Mobile has several HSPA 7.2 compatible devices and smartphones, including its USB webConnect adapter.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                T-Mobile already has plans to leapfrog over AT&amp;T, however, with HSPA+, a 21 Mbps variant that it can generally add as a software update. The <a href="http://www.gsmworld.com/our-work/mobile_broadband/networks.aspx?pn=1&amp;sf=hsdr">GSM Association lists 17 networks worldwide</a> already using this flavor, including three in Canada. The company plans to start with coastal US cities in the next few weeks, following commercial availability in Philadelphia, its pilot city, and then fill in most of the rest of its territory during 2010. So far, only one HSPA+ device has been announced—another USB adapter—but there's a variety of HSPA+ gear already for sale in Europe and Canada that can be adapted. (T-Mobile has a nearly unique slice of 3G spectrum that isn't harmonized with any other North American or European carrier.)

                                These efforts add some life into 3G, and allow AT&amp;T and T-Mobile to both ease congestion and have greater performance than Sprint and Verizon. Sprint and Verizon won't be able to speed up their existing 3G networks, and both are relying on future deployments to let them jump up a notch to 4G, as discussed next.

                                T-Mobile, as the trailing fourth-largest carrier, and a relatively small amount of mobile broadband spectrum may be able to take the technical advantage for two to three years, as AT&amp;T has no present plans to adopt HSPA+. Monica Paolini, the principal at analysis firm Senza Fili Consulting, said, "An operator with less spectrum, but also fewer subscribers may be better off than a larger operator with more spectrum," but that "HSPA+ is at best a short term advantage" as competitors ramp up for true 4G networks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Biba of Novarum agreed: "I came away with the clear impression that HSPA 7.2 and HSPA+ have legs over WiMax—much less LTE," he said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But how long can those flavors compete? It all depends on how fast LTE and WiMax blanket the country.

                                The point of 4G is to let carriers take advantage of wide swaths of spectrum to deliver far greater capacity over large areas. The two leading worldwide standards are WiMax (an outgrowth of IEEE 802.16e and other standards) and LTE, which comes from the 3GPP standards group for work on 3G and later.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Clearwire and other companies around the world have already deployed WiMax; <a href="http://www.wimaxmaps.org/">some reports</a> and the WiMax trade group put the number at hundreds of WiMax networks in use, although subscriber numbers have remained low as networks are still gaining footholds. Clearwire has just a few dozen areas covered in the US, as small as single cities, and as large as metro areas, but representing just tens of millions of potential customers. The firm plans to reach 120 million people this year.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                LTE, by contrast, isn't deployed anywhere except in small pilot networks. Verizon plans to have commercial deployment in place in some cities or swath of the country during 2010 (the firm says about 100 million people in 25 to 30 cities will be covered by year's end), while AT&amp;T is talking about pilots in 2010 and deployment in 2011. Unlike 2G and 3G networks, LTE will initially be data only, with USB adapters likely the first wave of hardware. Verizon <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703791704575114130970301388.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">said recently</a> that it expects the first LTE handsets for calling in mid-2011.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Clearwire, AT&amp;T, and Verizon are able to deploy 4G networks because of huge, specialized spectrum portfolios. Clearwire became a new entity majority-owned by Sprint in 2008 in order to merge a large array of 2.5 GHz licenses that both firms had separately acquired. (It's a long and winding story about how spectrum originally intended for distance learning and other purposes wound up in those companies' hands.) Google, Intel, and several cable firms are minority owners of Clearwire.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                AT&amp;T and Verizon acquired large amounts of 700 MHz spectrum through purchases and auctions, the most prominent of which were in 2008. This spectrum was made available due to the digital television (DTV) transition; the 700 MHz bands were freed up on on the completion of analog television transmission on June 12, 2009.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The 700 MHz band has enormously better range and penetration of buildings than the same power of signal at 2.5 GHz, which is an advantage for Verizon and AT&amp;T. Some experts have said that 700MHz will require as few as one-quarter as many base stations to offer identical coverage to 2.5 GHz.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Both 4G network types can use a large array of channel widths (such as 5, 10, 20, and 40 MHz), spectrum bands, and encoding styles. This makes it often hard to pin down capabilities precisely.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Early reporting on WiMax led the non-technical to believe that it would operate at 70 miles from a base station while you were traveling 70 mph at 70 Mbps. I'm only exaggerating slightly. WiMax, like previous cellular network technologies, can operate at high speeds or long distances, but not both combined; WiMax, LTE, and even 3G are all designed to work at lower rates for truly mobile devices, in cars, trains, and other vehicles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Clearwire has opted for 10 MHz channels, which should allow it to push a raw rate of tens of Mbps. The Clear service promises its highest-paying customers 3 to 6 Mbps in typical performance with peaks of 10 Mbps. Ken Biba of Novarum said that his firm's testing found average rates of 2.2 Mbps in four tested cities, although testers did identify bursts to 10 Mbps.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Measurements of radio signal levels for Clearwire strongly suggest that much more infrastructure must be deployed to get signal and performance to levels required," Biba said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Clearwire <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20100323005816&amp;newsLang=en">said on March 23</a>, 2010, that it would be doubling the amount of gear at each of its transmission sites, increasing end users' speeds by 20 to 30 percent, as well as increasing backhaul by 250 percent. The firm's CEO said in a press release that the average Clear customer consumed 7 GB of bandwidth each month, which makes perfect sense when Clear is being touted as an alternative to either or both wired broadband service and mobile 3G service.

                                LTE deployment is less clear-cut at this point, because we haven't seen what AT&amp;T and Verizon plan to release. <a href="https://www.lte.vzw.com/AboutLTE/VerizonWirelessLTENetwork/tabid/6003/Default.aspx">Verizon says</a> it will use 10 MHz uplink and downlink channels with MIMO (multiple-in, multiple-out) antenna array.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The additional antennas can allow reuse of the same frequency over multiple paths, increasing the potential throughput. The 802.11n flavor of Wi-Fi can achieve over short distances up to a 450 Mbps raw data rate by using a 3x3 array of input and output antennas and 40 MHz channels, due to three separate 150 Mbps data streams that carve unique paths through space.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Verizon says it can support 5 to 12 Mbps downstream and 2 to 5 Mpbs upstream. This doesn't mean mobile devices will receive these data rates; Verizon cites video as being a key application. But it does give Verizon a large pool to play with.

                                As In-Stat's Allen Nogee said, "A phone getting video can only get so much data. If you had 10 Mbps, what are you going to do with it?" Nogee said that what carriers are working on is more like "a reliable 1 Mbps to a lot of people."

                                There's a separate issue associated with 4G: reduced latency. While throughput measures the bits per second traveling over a network, latency measures how long it takes for a request to be answered. Think of potential bandwidth as a water pipe, throughput as the amount of water in the pipe, and latency as the amount of time, after you turn on the tap, that the water flows.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                AT&amp;T, for instance, <a href="http://developer.att.com/developer/index.jsp?page=toolsTechDetail&amp;id=7600078">tells developers</a> that its UMTS/HSPA network can have a latency of 100 to 200 milliseconds (ms) for a round trip, while HSUPA/HSDPA can be well below 100 ms. Establishing an initial connection can take much longer, too: Motorola pegs a "3.5G" flavor (HSPA or HSPA+) at <a href="http://business.motorola.com/experiencelte/lte-depth.html">taking two seconds to establish a connection</a>, and then as much as 100 ms roundtrip thereafter.

                            <p>
                                Voice, real-time multiplayer games, and video conferencing all suffer when latency is high. <a href="http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=606583">A 300 ms round trip</a> is considered at the limits of acceptability for a VoIP call, but lower latency makes the call sound better. Variations on latency within a call can also cause echo or other problems, too. The higher the latency the more sluggish everything becomes until it breaks through to a level that users find noticeably unacceptable.

                                Verizon says LTE latency will be 1/4th that of comparable 3G. Motorola and other sources put latency as low at 10 ms for a roundtrip after an initial connection taking 50 ms. WiMax has relatively low latency as well, but the WiMax Forum and manufacturers aren't specifying a number; below 50 ms for a round trip seems certain, but far lower rates may be achievable.

                                The upshot of all this progress will be more extensive, faster, higher capacity access. Competition among carriers will bring 3G and 4G speeds into the hinterlands as well as major metropolises.

                                LTE as AT&amp;T and Verizon will deploy is just the first of many revisions expected for that spec, which will boost it far higher; a "WiMax 2" (802.1*6*m) is already inching towards production,<br>
                                , and may be in use widely by 2012.

                                What analysts have said is that the devices will continue to pull these networks, and promote competition among them. Interesting devices that can make use of increased bandwidth make the networks on which the devices work more interesting.

                                Let's not lose sight of why these networks are being built, however: the failure of current networks to keep up with the most popular high-consumption mass-market device. As Allen Nogee of In-Stite put it, Verizon "wouldn't be doing LTE if it wasn't for the iPhone." The threat of an iPhone planet drives 3G advances and 4G deployments.
