                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                By now you've heard about that <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/presspol/publications/papers/torture_at_times_hks_students.pdf">surprising new Harvard study</a> finding that news orgs that routinely called waterboarding "torture" for many years suddenly shifted away from the term after it became public that the Bush administration had sanctioned it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The New York Times has now explained the reasoning behind its decision, and it's pretty surprising. The paper disputed the study's accuracy, but it <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/20100701/ts_ynews/ynews_ts3004">gave Michael Calderone a statement</a> acknowledging the shift and conceding that Bush administration entreaties were partly responsible:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    "As the debate over interrogation of terror suspects grew post-9/11, defenders of the practice (including senior officials of the Bush administration) insisted that it did not constitute torture," a Times spokesman said in a statement.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "When using a word amounts to taking sides in a political dispute, our general practice is to supply the readers with the information to decide for themselves. Thus we describe the practice vividly, and we point out that it is denounced by international covenants and in American tradition as a form of torture."
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                The Times' explanation is that once Bush officials started arguing that waterboarding <i>wasn't</i> torture, the only way to avoid taking sides was to stop using the word. But here's the problem: Not using the word <i>also</i> consitutes taking a side: That of the Bush administration.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That's because this debate wasn't merely a semantic one. It was occuring in a legal context.<br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The administration's critics pointed out that the decision to approve waterboarding was illegal under international law designating it torture. The Bush administration argued that waterboarding <i>isn't</i> torture in order to argue that it <i>isn't</i> illegal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The decision to refrain from calling waterboarding "torture" is tantamount to siding with the Bush administration's claim that the <i>act it acknowledged doing</i> is not illegal under any statute. No one is saying the Times should have adopted the role of judge and jury and proclaimed the Bush administration officially guilty. Rather, the point is that by dropping use of the word "torture," it took the Bush position -- against those who argued that the act Bush officials sanctioned is <i>already</i> agreed upon as illegal under the law.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Think of it this way: We all agree that pickpocketing constitutes "theft." A pickpocket doesn't get to come along and argue: "No, what I did isn't <i>theft</i>, it's merely <i>pickpocketing</i>, and therefore it isn't illegal." Any newspaper that played along with a pickpocket's demand to stop using the word "theft" would be taking the pickpocket's side, not occupying any middle ground. There <i>is</i> no middle ground here.<br>
