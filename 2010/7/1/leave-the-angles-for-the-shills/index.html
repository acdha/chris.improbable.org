                                </p>

                                        I'm sorry -- there is no other hand. Waterboarding is torture, period. It's been that way for decades -- it was torture when <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/29/politics/main3554687.shtml">we went after Japanese war criminals</a> who used the ancient and inhumane interrogation tactic, it was torture when <a href="http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/200904270033">Pol Pot</a> and some of the worst dictators known to mankind used it against their own people, and it was torture to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/02/AR2007110201170_2.html">U.S. military which once punished soldiers</a> who adopted the grim practice.&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And waterboarding was described as "torture," almost without fail, in America's newspapers.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Until 2004, after the arrival of George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, and their criminal notions of "enhanced interrogations." For four years -- in what would have to be the bizarro-world version of "speaking truth to power," waterboarding was almost never torture on U.S. newsprint. Then waterboarding-as-torture nearly made a mild comeback in journo-world, until perpetrators like Cheney and Inquirer op-ed columnist John Yoo began the big pushback, when American newspapers bravely turned their tails and fled.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The sordid&nbsp;history is spelled out in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/30/once-america-started-wate_n_631447.html">a significant new report</a> by the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard (you can <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/presspol/publications/papers/torture_at_times_hks_students.pdf">read it as a PDF file</a> here). The report notes:

                                        <em>From the early 1930's until the modern story broke in 2004, the newspapers that covered waterboarding almost uniformly called the practice torture or implied it was torture:</em> The New York Times <em>characterized it thus in 81.5% (44 of 54) of articles on the subject and</em> The Los Angeles Times <em>did so in 96.3% of articles (26 of 27). By contrast, from 2002-2008, the studied newspapers almost never referred to waterboarding as torture.</em> The New York Times <em>called waterboarding torture or implied it was torture in just 2 of 143 articles (1.4%).</em> The Los Angeles Times <em>did so in 4.8% of articles (3 of 63).</em> The Wall Street Journal <em>characterized the practice as torture in just 1 of 63 articles (1.6%). USA Today never called waterboarding torture or implied it was torture.</em>

                                    <p>
                                        The report also notes that waterboarding had constantly been referred to as torture by newspapers when other nations did it, but when the United States did it in the 2000s, it was, to paraphrase Richard Nixon, not illegal. The study proves scientifically something we've been talking about here at Attytood since Day One, about the tragic consequences of&nbsp;the elevation of an unnatural&nbsp;notion of objectivity in which newspapers abandoned any core human values -- even when it comes to something as clear cut as torture -- to give equal moral weight to both sides of an not-so-debatable issue (not to mention <a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1978">treating scientific issues like climate changes in the same zombie-like manner</a>).

                                        Never before in my adult life have I been so ashamed of my profession, journalism.

                                        There's already some good analysis of the report out there from the likes of <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/06/30/media">Glenn Greenwald</a> and <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/adam_serwer_archive?month=06&amp;year=2010&amp;base_name=when_is_torture_not_torture">Adam Serwer</a>, who writes:
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin-left:40px">
                                        <em>As soon as Republicans started quibbling over the definition of torture, traditional media outlets felt compelled to treat the issue as a "controversial" matter, and in order to appear as though they weren't taking a side, media outlets treated the issue as unsettled, rather than confronting a blatant falsehood. To borrow John Holbo's formulation, the media, confronted with the group think of two sides of an argument, decided to eliminate the "think" part of the equation so they could be "fair" to both groups.</em>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The irony that Serwer notes -- and I&nbsp;completely agree -- is that in claiming they were working so hard not to take "a side," the journalists who wouldn't call waterboarding "torture" were absolutely taking a side and handing a victory to the Bush administration, which convinced newspapers to stop unambiguously describing this crime as they had done for decades prior to 2004. It's a tactic that has continued to this day. It's the reason why Cheney-- who'd been nearly invisible when he was in power -- and Yoo were suddenly all over the place beginning on Jan. 21, 2009, because they were desperately trying to keep framing this debate as the newspapers had, that their torture tactics were a public, political disagreement, and not a war crime.
                                    </p>

                                        And tragically, they succeeded. They were America's leaders, they tortured, and they got away with it. And newspapers and other journalists drove the getaway car.
