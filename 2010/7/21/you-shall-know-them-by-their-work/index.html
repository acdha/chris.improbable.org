                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                A few weeks ago, there was a targeted leak of old Journolist threads meant to humiliate and harm David Weigel. That was an awful experience for all involved. Now we're getting the inevitable dregs of that story: right-wing reporters crawling through all of the thousands and thousands of threads from the e-mail list in order to juice the excerpts for a couple more hits. The first round of this was a tragedy. The second is a farce.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yesterday's <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/07/20/documents-show-media-plotting-to-kill-stories-about-rev-jeremiah-wright/">dispatch</a> attempted to detail a conspiracy to bury the Reverend Wright story, or maybe respond to it by calling conservatives racist, or maybe just stick to the policy questions. It was hard to say, because rather than an actual media conspiracy, the Daily Caller had a handful of avowedly liberal columnists arguing with one another about Jeremiah Wright. I didn't participate in that thread, and the next day, wrote <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=05&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=if_wright_were_white">this post</a>, which argued that Wright's comments would be a big deal even if he'd been white and the candidate had been John Kerry. This <a href="http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/50044.html">did not make lefties happy</a>. Some conspiracy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The other piece of evidence in yesterday's story was a public letter signed by 41 members of Journolist protesting ABC News's conduct during one of the presidential primary debate. You may remember this one. Greg Mitchell, of Editor and Publisher (and not a member of Journolist), called it a "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-mitchell/the-debate-a-shameful-nig_b_97122.html">shameful night for US media</a>." On Journolist, Tom Schaller, a professor of political science at the University of Maryland, wrote an angry letter and asked people if they'd like to sign it. Then the letter was posted in public. You can read it <a href="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/04/18/_journalists_slam_abc_debate_t/l">here</a>. Some conspiracy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There's a piece of that story, incidentally, that the Daily Caller -- and their Journolist beat reporter, Jonathan Strong -- knew but did not report. After the letter came out, I thought a lot about whether it was appropriate for a listserv including journalists to be used in that way. I decided it wasn't. I banned further letters from being circulated on the list. The Daily Caller had e-mails of me doing this, and of shutting down future attempts, but they declined to publish them, or even mention my policy. So the one actual attempt at coordination -- lame and earnest as it was -- led to a policy against future attempts at coordination. But the Daily Caller didn't report this. Didn't fit the narrative, I guess.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Which brings us to the Daily Caller. There might be some interesting stories to write about a trove of 25,000+ e-mails -- though, in reality, most of them would say something like "lots of people have lots of different opinions" -- but their approach has been to cherrypick the few snippets that support the most sensational headlines, and then attribute them to "Journolist," or "journalists," as opposed to whichever specific person is being quoted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Today's <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/07/21/liberal-journalists-suggest-government-shut-down-fox-news/">headline</a>, for instance, is "FOX HUNT: Liberal journalists suggest government shut down Fox News." This, uh, <em>never happened</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here's what did happen. On March 12, there was a thread about a column Howell Raines (not a Jlist member, I should note) wrote for The Washington Post about Fox's form of advocacy journalism. In the thread, Jonathan Zasloff, a law professor at UCLA, asked, "is there any reason why the FCC couldn't simply pull their broadcasting permit once it expires?" Michael Scherer, an actual journalist at Time magazine, reacted with incredulity. "You really want political parties/white houses picking and choosing which news organizations to favor?" He replied.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And that's ... it. No one mentioned Zasloff's FCC comment again. The thread moved into broader questions about Fox. The Caller goes on to misrepresent a John Judis post that it says agreed with Zasloff, but what Judis actually said was "Fox, like the business/GOP thinktanks that began in the '70s, are taking advantage of an older Progressive era concept of disinterestedness and objectivity to peddle partisan coverage. It may be that it's counter-productive for the White House to out them, but it would not be unprincipled for the O adm to give precedence to the other networks, and to newspapers like the New York Times and Washington Post that try to adhere to, rather than exploit, the older standard." That isn't even a controversial opinion, and it's certainly not about "shutting down" Fox News.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Moreover, the actual evidence of conspiracy -- public writings on using the FCC to attack Fox -- doesn't exist, at least so far as I know. And yet this story has been leading the Daily Caller's web page -- huge type, huge picture of Obama -- all day.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So let's recap: The Daily Caller's story is wrong. "Journalists" did not suggest shutting Fox News down. A law professor wondered whether the FCC could do it. The journalists in the thread ignored or opposed the idea (which is of course proper; it's absurd to think that the FCC would, or should, pull the plug on Fox), and then there was a long conversation over whether Fox was a news organization or an activist organization.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the Daily Caller's story made sense for the Daily Caller. Tucker Carlson, the site's editor, previewed this story on Sean Hannity's show last night. Presumably he'll go on Fox News to talk about it today. For the Daily Caller, a young organization in need of hits and publicity, it makes sense to feed Fox a story about, well, Fox, and how embattled conservatives are in the face of the mighty liberal media conspiracy, which in this case boils down to a question asked by a law professor in California.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ironically, this sort of thing was exactly what the Fox News thread was about: How do you handle organizations like the Daily Caller that sell themselves as news outlets but "are taking advantage of an older Progressive era concept of disinterestedness and objectivity to peddle partisan coverage?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's a hard question. A better example -- and one much less related to me -- was Andrew Breitbart's decision to pump a partial video clip of an Agriculture Department official explaining how, two decades ago, her association with two white farmers taught her to stop focusing solely on the inequalities of racism and see the struggles that even white people were fighting. But Breitbart's clip omitted the beginning and the end of the story, and focused only on Shirley Sherrod's explanation of the beliefs she had to overcome in herself. In doing, it made her sound racist.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And it worked. The Sherrod tape was treated as news, not a political ad that actual news reporters might want to follow up on. The Daily Caller pitched in happily: "As you look in vain for this in the newspapers and on the nightly news, imagine if Shirley Sherrod was a white person in a position of power and was talking about a poor black person," <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/07/19/so-i-figured-if-i-take-him-to-one-of-them-that-his-own-kind-would-take-care-of-him/#ixzz0uJm8vk88">wrote</a> Jim Treacher. "You wouldn’t be able to walk around in any newsroom in the country, what with all the drool on the floor."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sherrod was fired from her position before the rest of the video -- and the white couple in question, who surfaced yesterday to explain their long friendship and deep gratitude toward Sherrod -- could make its way into the story. As my mother used to say, a lie can make it halfway across the world while the truth is still lacing up its boots.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's safe to say that the Daily Caller will continue pumping the Journolist story. There are tens of thousands of e-mails in that trove, a lot of people speaking unguardedly, unwisely and impolitically. That's a lot of grist you can use for various attention-grabbing headlines, and stories full of quotes out of context. There's not a lot to be done about it, and I won't be trying to answer every story, or explain every thread. I actually expect this to be my final public comment on the subject.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What even the Daily Caller's cherrypicked articles have shown is that Journolist was a long-running argument between people who had different views and different interests. In another wrinkle they haven't mentioned, Journolist included Gautham Nagesh, a Daily Caller reporter (he's since moved to The Hill). He frequently disagreed with other members of the list. It also included almost 400-some other people, including grad students, low-level editors, midwestern academics, and many others I'd never met or known of before they joined. If I had thought there was some deep and dark conspiracy to protect, I can guarantee you I would've been a bit more selective.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But there wasn't. Though the Daily Caller's headlines suggests the listserv of 400 spoke with one voice, their own reporting, and their own reporters, show that the reality was very different. It just doesn't fit their agenda to say so.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And as for the obvious question -- why don't I just release all the e-mails? -- the answer is that I still believe people have the right to assume privacy when they send e-mails to an off-the-record list. They should be careful about what they write, but that's a different question.
