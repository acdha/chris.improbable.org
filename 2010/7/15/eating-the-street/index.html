                                Mexico City’s streets are dense with food vendors. Statistics are hard to come by, since the industry is largely unregulated, but in her 2007 <a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a783637492"><em>Survey of Street Foods in Mexico City</em></a>, anthropologist Janet Long quotes a survey by <em>Reforma</em> newspaper that found 560,000 street vendors in the city proper — an astonishing one vendor for every 8.5 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilango"><em>chilangos</em></a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Certainly, walking around the city it can seem as if almost everyone is eating mysterious and delicious-smelling foods on the street, from dawn to dusk. In his must-read portrait of Mexico City, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594483787?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ediblgeogr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1594483787"><em>First Stop in the New World</em></a>, author David Lida writes that:

                                    The sidewalk is a <em>chilango’s</em> pit stop, his permanent picnic. He likes to eat standing up, the aroma of sizzling meat mingling with those of exhaust fumes, putrefying garbage, dust, and sweat.

                                Fortunately, several <a href="http://postopolis.org/">Postopoleros</a> (including my fellow bloggers <a href="http://www.negrophonic.com/">Jace Clayton</a> and <a href="http://wayneandwax.com/">Wayne Marshall</a>) were lucky enough to be the guinea pigs for an amazing <a href="http://www.eatmexico.com/?page_id=264">three-hour street food tour and tasting</a> by a new outfit, <a href="http://www.eatmexico.com/">Eat Mexico</a>. Under the expert guidance of Mexico City native Jesica López Sol and American expat <a href="http://lesleytellez.wordpress.com/">Lesley Téllez</a>, we slowly ate our way around <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Col.+Cuauht%C3%A9moc+rio+lerma+mexico+city&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=R%C3%ADo+Lerma,+Cuauht%C3%A9moc,+Distrito+Federal,+Mexico&amp;ei=d2s8TIuKA4OKlweN1eigAw&amp;ved=0CBgQ8gEwAA&amp;z=16">the triangle of streets named after rivers</a> between James Sullivan and Paseo de la Reforma in the Cuauhtémoc section of the city.

                                We started out on fairly safe territory, although possibly too greedily, with a giant freshly-made juice each. Next on the menu were <em>tacos al pastor</em>, a delicious Mexican-ised pork and pineapple version of the traditional lamb gyros <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_pastor">introduced by Lebanese immigrants in the 1930s</a>. To quote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594483787?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ediblgeogr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1594483787">David Lida</a> again:

                                    Mexico City has no indigenous cuisine, but if there is such a thing as a municipal dish, it would have to be <em>tacos al pastor</em>. A variation on Middle Eastern <em>shawarma</em>, it is made from pork, marinated with various spices, including garlic and a heavy dose of annatto, which gives it a shrill orange color. The slices of pork are mounted atop each other to form a huge orb, and impaled on a metal stick, which revolves around a vertical charcoal grill.

                                The exact ingredients in each taco stand’s marinade are a closely guarded secret, but various internet sources seem to suggest <a href="http://www.batista.org/pastor.html">Coca-Cola is often involved</a>, as well as the more standard vinegar, chiles, and orange juice.

                                Lesley and Jesica were fantastic hosts, armed with a chopping board and knife in order to divide each burrito, <em>quesadilla</em>, <em>tamal</em>, and taco into sample sizes, as well as a wealth of information about the ingredients, preparation, and cultural background of each food type on our tour.

                                The street food menu has its own temporal rhythm, just as a restaurant would serve different foods at different times of day. We were lucky to find any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atole"><em>atole</em></a> or <em>tamales</em> left at noon, as the corn-based thin porridge-y drink and the steamed, stuffed corn-dough snack are a traditional breakfast combo. Later in the evening, Jesica and Lesley told us, <em>tamales</em> make a comeback, alongside <em>camotes</em> (boiled sweet potatoes) and <em>elotes</em> (corn-on-the-cob, served sprinkled with chile powder and grated cheese).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Of course, the location of street food shifts over the course of the day too. Our tour took place in a business district between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., meaning that the streets were filled with local workers looking for something filling for <a href="http://gomexico.about.com/od/historyculture/tp/mexican_meals.htm">a late <em>almuerzo</em> or early <em>comida</em></a>. In the early mornings, women selling <em>atole</em> frequently circulate around transport hubs to provide commuters with a light <em>desayuno</em>. Meanwhile, as Janet Long points out in her <a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content%7Edb=all%7Econtent=a783637492"><em>Survey</em></a>, in the evenings, <em>elote</em> sellers cluster near movie theatres, and other food stands “may be set up in parks to cater to a different public than the one served during the day.”<br>

                                Among the many foods we tried were some that I didn’t even know existed. My new favourite, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tlacoyo"><em>tlacoyo</em></a>, is a long torpedo-shaped cornmeal pancake stuffed with beans and cheese, and in the case of the one we sampled, topped with <em>nopales</em> (cactus leaves) and more cheese. Later, I went back for a blue cornmeal <em>tlacoyo</em>, topped just with salsa. It was possibly even better.

We tried one filled with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochinita_pibil"><em>cochinita pibil</em></a>, a slow-cooked pork stew, and together the soft taco and tender meat formed a somewhat baby-food-like, yet delicious, mush.

                                At the opposite end of the texture spectrum was our grand finale: <em>taco de carnitas.</em> As Angeleno food critic <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/2009-04-30/eat-drink/pork-in-the-time-of-swine-flu-mexico-city-39-s-pig-cuisine-snout-to-hoof/1">Jonathan Gold describes it</a>, carnitas is basically any and all parts of the pig, “rendered and then seethed in their own lard until the surfaces caramelize, the interiors soften, and the mass reaches a sweet, succulent equilibrium.”

                            <p>
                                I must admit to being a little bit full by this point on the tour, and hence unsure whether I really <em>needed</em> even a small serving of pork fried in its own fat. However, Jesica invited us to sample chunks of pig skin, snout, lung, and <em>nana</em>, or uterus, with such charming enthusiasm, it seemed churlish to refuse.

                                I have to confess, I did hesitate before trying the <a href="http://lesleytellez.wordpress.com/2009/07/31/a-light-breakfast-of-tacos-de-nana-or-the-meat-of-the-pig-uterus/"><em>nana</em></a>. For starters, it looked like a giant purplish <em>fusilli</em>, which defied my limited understanding of anatomy. However, <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/2009-04-30/eat-drink/pork-in-the-time-of-swine-flu-mexico-city-39-s-pig-cuisine-snout-to-hoof/1">as Gold correctly notes</a>, ordering <em>maciza</em> (plain meat only) at a <em>carnitas</em> stand can’t help but feel like a character flaw:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    There is nothing wrong with <em>maciza</em> — you may actually prefer <em>maciza</em> — but as when standing in line at a famous <em>gelatería</em> only to order vanilla, one is occasionally under the impression that there is something less than manly about the decision, that one has declined to consider the possibilities.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                And of course, as it turns out, the <em>nana</em> really is delicious – rich and firm like a <em>filet mignon</em>, and not at all rubbery or iron-flavoured, which were my main fears. I felt as though I had finally earned my stripes as a genuine food blogger!

                                As Janet Long notes in her <a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a783637492"><em>Survey</em></a>, the food sold on the streets of D.F. is for the most part traditional Mexican cuisine: “the same basic diet based on maize, beans, squash, and chile peppers that they have been eating for well over 5,000 years.” Burgers and hot dogs are available, but seem much less popular.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to Long, the practise of street food vending is itself traditional:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Long before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the early sixteenth century, Aztec food vendors were setting up their stands near the Tlatelolco Market in the city, then known as Tenochtitlan, or along the canals that served as roads in the ancient city. They sold fully cooked dishes of insects, fish, and meat stews to the 60,000 people said to congregate at the great market every day.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They also sold a diversity of chile pepper sauces described by the Spaniards as “hot, very hot, very, very hot, and brilliantly hot.”
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Today, each taco stands offers a similar range of salsas for those looking for what David Lida terms, “the exquisite sensation of <em>enchilarse</em> – to be overwhelmed by chile.” In my greedy haste, I kept eating my samples before remembering to add any salsa, although as these prepared sauces have been identified as the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2010-07-13-Salsa14_ST_N.htm">most likely hosts of bacterial contamination</a>, perhaps that was not such a bad thing.

                            <p>
                                Although Mexico City has always had a tradition of street food, as well as a climate that permits year-round outdoor life, Janet Long’s statistics show that the number of vendors has more-or-less tripled in the past decade. The reasons behind that expansion reveal a fascinating blend of socio-economic, political, and infrastructural forces that shape the D.F.’s landscape of mobile dining.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One factor behind the boom in street food vendors is the sprawling growth of the city itself, and its resulting nightmarish traffic. As Long explains, the city’s size and gridlock “force people to travel greater distances to their place of work or study, and make it impossible for them to return home for the mid-day meal, which is traditionally the most important meal of the day in Mexico.” Meanwhile, some recent urban arrivals “must resort to living in single rooms, without cooking facilities,” making them a captive market for taco stands and <em>tamal</em> vendors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <img title="91 Taco Don Guero" src="http://www.ediblegeography.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/91-Taco-Don-Guero.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="306">

                            <p>
                                The rural-urban migration driving the city’s growth is itself a symptom of another major force contributing to the growth of a micro-entrepreneurial street vendor class. Long uses data from the Mexican Institute of Social Security to show that:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Of every ten jobs created in 2005, six were in the informal sector. [...] The formal sector of the economy cannot provide enough jobs to employ a majority of the population. [...] Unemployed workers are basically provided with two options: 1) attempt to cross the border into the United States and find work as an illegal worker or, 2) look for work in the informal sector.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                In other words, street vending serves “as an escape valve to relieve the social and economic pressures created by unemployment.” With a bare minimum of capital investment, would-be workers can sell food to both support themselves <em>and</em> provide a source of cheap food for their fellow low-income <em>chilangos</em>.
                            </p>

                                This combination makes street food vendors politically untouchable, even though they operate for the most part illegally, without paying taxes, for permits, or even for city services — according to Long, “water can be obtained from public fountains and it is common for electricity to be obtained illegally through extensions that are attached to electric lines.”

                                    Since I arrived in 1990, street vendors have been a problem, and each successive mayor has announced plans to do away with them. [...] Still, tacitly, they have been tolerated. In a city where there isn’t enough work to go around, few politicians are willing to take measures that would separate people from their jobs.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                So, although health regulations and vendor permit requirements exist, Mexico City’s government concludes — probably correctly — that they would be impossible to enforce, and therefore, they are universally ignored.

                                In other words, our tacos were an edible symptom of economic desperation, political impotence, and a city stretched beyond its infrastructural capacity.

                                If supply is one aspect of the behind-the-scenes geography of street food vending, storage is another. At <a href="http://www.foodprintproject.com/new-york/">Foodprint NYC</a>, for example, I was intrigued to hear panelist <a href="http://streetvendor.org/">Sean Basinski</a> explain that New York’s food trucks have to be taken to a Department of Health-approved garage every night, for storage and cleaning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                No such formal facilities seem to exist in Mexico City: according to Janet Long, food carts and stands are either “rolled to a safe spot at night,” or “partially dismantled at the end of the day and left on the street, where they are fairly safe, since nothing is left behind except the metal frame.”
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                Perhaps the most fascinating statistic in Janet Long’s <a href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a783637492"><em>Survey</em></a> is that nearly half of the food sold at Mexico City’s street food stands has been prepared in a domestic kitchen. As she puts it, “There is no separation between the public kitchen and the domestic kitchen.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The ubiquitous taco stands and baskets of tamales occupying their three-foot median along Mexico City’s traffic-clogged streets are thus a kind of distributed domesticity and an ad hoc network of unofficially-subsidised street cafeterias, as well as a tourist dining destination.
