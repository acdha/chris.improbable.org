                            <p>
                                Chocolate is an oddity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s one of the few native American foodstuffs to make it immediately to the Old World.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And now, when anyone who has any pride in their foodie credentials praises the fresh and natural, chocolate, one of the most elaborately processed and industrialized foods around, is given a pass and allowed into the hallowed company of heirloom vegetables and fruits and grass fed meat in the foodie ranking of goodies.  That, and the fact that several new articles and books about chocolate have come my way, are the reason for this and three or four upcoming posts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’m going to start with contemporary artisanal processing. I’m re-posting (with permission and a little light editing) a lovely and non-technical <a href="http://yapakyakap.blogspot.com/">blog</a> post by Beatrice Misa in the Philippines about how she processed some beans from her family’s backyard–with one important modern innovation.  It’s about as clear and well-illustrated as anything I have encountered on the subject.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And it reminds us that cacao went east to the Philippines as well as west to Europe, along with the techniques for getting from pod to tablea (tablet of drinking chocolate).

                                    The cacao tree is a humble one, not particularly beautiful, growing well only under canopies. Taken from the forest basins of the Americas, they have traveled well into our muggy, tropical island setting, cultivated in some large plantations and agroforestry areas, and in numerous backyards all over the country. There is still considerable backyard production and kitchen processing going on to turn cacao beans into <em>tableas</em> (tablets for making hot chocolate) most especially in the province.

                                    I took my fruit from my great-uncle’s house in Metro Manila. The pods had been given all these years to the gardener, whose mother would do the tedious processing. As I am not schooled in these matters, I enlisted the help of Wilma, who is from Zamboanga and has been eating and growing the stuff since childhood. I have read about cacao processing in books, but I wanted to get an idea of how it is processed by normal people for everyday consumption.

                                    Seeds roasting on an iron skillet.

                                    The pods at the top of this page yielded many seeds, covered by fruit pulp that is absolutely delicious. I would describe the taste as sweet yet tart, like a mangosteen or a nice yellow mango. The “beans”, which look a bit like <a href="http://fruitspecies.blogspot.com/2007/09/rambutan-red-skin.html">rambutan seeds</a>, were set out to dry. After they were suitably devoid of moisture (a few weeks, given the rain), they were roasted. I thought them to be a bit burnt, but Wilma insisted that was how they liked it.

                                    Just as our house was filled with an aroma good enough to marry, we took the beans off and put them on a bilao (bamboo tray). Wilma used a glass bottle to crush the crunchy beans and force the skin to separate. She did this in a hurry, before everything cooled off.

                                    We then ran out into the garden and got rid of the skins directly into the soil by the same movements that people use to <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/winnow">winnow</a> rice. The instructions of blowing the skin away with a fan seem quite comical and devoid of integrated daily exercise, once you see how gracefully the skin floats to the ground for decomposition.

                                    We decide to grind this for drinking chocolate. We first used a mortar and pestle, which proved to be too much even for our idle, chatty selves. A coffee grinder works nicely.

                                    Once the paste was finished, we scouted the kitchen for a suitable mold. This we found in an old spice jar cap. We washed the paprika out of that and pressed the paste in.

                                    Standardization is important to us.

                                    You can tamp it out with a bit of difficulty. Cacao, at this stage, becomes the consistency of your high school experiment of baking soda and water. It seems solid, but when you press your finger against it, there is a slow melting that occurs. Thus, you cannot scoop it out of the mold without damaging it, you must pound it onto a solid surface with some force.

                                    From three pods, we get five 1-inch tableas.

                                    My excitement was barely enough to contain, so I plunked two of these still-soft tableas into a pot and whisk them with water into tsokolate, kakaw, cacao, chocolate-eh, whatever you may call it if you are from these islands. I feel I’ve come a bit closer to the holy grail of my cacao-loving conquest.

                                    Some things to change next time: It was a bit darkly roasted, more so than I am used to. Though delicious in its own way, I think I will decrease the roasting time. I was left with bits of the bean at the bottom of my cup, which I ate. Yes. I ate them, but it could have used a finer grind, so I may as well invest in a Turkish coffee grinder.

                                Now notice the one place where Beatrice cops out and abandons traditional methods.  The grinding of the roasted beans.  She puts them in the coffee grinder and presses the button.
