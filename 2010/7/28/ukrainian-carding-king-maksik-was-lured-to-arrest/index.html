                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2010/07/tjx.jpg"><img src="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2010/07/tjx.jpg" alt="" title="tjx" width="300" height="293"></a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A Ukrainian carder who earned more than $11 million selling credit and debit card data stolen from top U.S. retailers was lured to a meeting in Turkey in 2007 where he was arrested by local authorities, according to a new report released Wednesday.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Maksym Yastremskiy, alleged to be the underground carding kingpin known as “Maksik,” was sentenced to 30 years in a Turkish prison. He was a key player in the criminal ring of TJX hacker Albert Gonzalez.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Justice Department had said in its 2008 press release on the matter that he was seized <a href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2008/August/08-ag-689.html">while he was on vacation in Turkey</a>. But according to the new information from the U.S. Secret Service, Yastremskiy was actually lured to a face-to-face meeting in Turkey with an undercover operative.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s unclear if the meeting was arranged after he was already in Turkey on vacation or if he was specifically lured to the country for the meeting. The Secret Service did not immediately respond to a call for comment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The information appears in the appendix of the <a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2010/07/2010-Verizon-Data-Breach-Investigations-Report.pdf">2010 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report</a> (.pdf), an annual report that highlights information and statistics gleaned from breach investigations conducted by Verizon’s Investigative Response Team.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This year, for the first time, the report also incorporates data gleaned from cases investigated by the Secret Service. The latter includes some of the nation’s biggest breaches committed by Gonzalez and a team of U.S. and Russian hackers prior to 2008, when Gonzalez was finally arrested.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                                Gonzalez’s arrest was made possible by information obtained from an encrypted vault on Yastremskiy’s laptop.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to the Verizon report, the investigation that nabbed Yastremskiy and Gonzalez began in April 2005, when the Secret Service’s San Diego Field Office initiated an online undercover operation dubbed Carder Kaos, which targeted the top people suspected of committing carding and other online financial crimes. The operation quickly focused on a suspect who went by the online nick “Maksik,” whom authorities say was “the most prolific vendor of compromised credit card numbers in the world.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Secret Service engaged in a number of undercover online transactions with “Maksik” involving the purchase of stolen credit card data, which led to face-to-face undercover meetings with Yastremskiy in Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey. It was during his visits to these countries, the report says, that authorities obtained enough evidence to secure an indictment for Yastremskiy, which was filed in California.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Verizon report doesn’t say so, but court documents in the Gonzalez case suggest that the Secret Service may have secured some of this evidence through a <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/08/gonzalez-evidence/">“sneak-and-peek” search of Yastremskiy’s laptop</a> while he was traveling through Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. On June 14, 2006 the Secret Service worked with local authorities to secretly obtain a copy of Yastremskiy’s hard drive to conduct the search. It’s not clear if they actually did obtain anything from the hard drive at this point, however, since the drive was likely encrypted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then in July 2007, another undercover meeting was arranged in Turkey, according to the Verizon report, at which point Yastremskiy was seized by Turkish police.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Court records have already filled in some of the details that the Verizon report doesn’t offer. The day before Yastremskiy’s arrest, Secret Service agents <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/08/gonzalez-evidence/">obtained another copy of the carder’s encrypted hard drive</a>. They accompanied the Turkish police to a hotel where Yastremskiy was staying. While he was out of the room, the police seized his Lamborghini laptop, which had a Cyrillic/English keyboard, and brought it to Secret Service agents across the hall, who photographed the computer, including a logon screen that displayed the name “Mars.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Four days after the arrest, after the U.S. submitted a formal mutual legal assistant request backed by the California indictment, Turkish police gave U.S. agents a copy of the encrypted hard drive. Yastremskiy evidently gave authorities his password at some point, though it’s not known what led him to do so.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Data obtained from his laptop, along with other information, allowed authorities to zero in on two hackers who appeared to be Yastremskiy’s biggest suppliers of stolen card data. The hackers, who went by the online names “Johnnyhell” and “Segvec,” provided Yastremskiy with data stolen from top retailers such as TJX, OfficeMax and Dave &amp; Busters restaurant chain.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Based on forensic evidence collected from the intrusion into Dave &amp; Busters and evidence taken from Maksik’s computer, authorities identified “Jonnyhell” as Alexander Suvorov of Estonia. He was arrested in Germany in March 2008, while he was en route to Bali, Indonesia, for vacation, according to the Justice Department. He pleaded guilty to the Dave &amp; Busters breach but has not been sentenced yet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Segvec” was eventually identified as Gonzalez, who was arrested in May 2008. This year, in March, Gonzalez was <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/tjx-sentencing/">sentenced to an unprecedented 20 years in prison</a> for his involvement in the crimes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to the Verizon report, the number of breached records in 2009 dramatically decreased over the previous year. In 2008, 360 million records were compromised in cases investigated by Verizon and the Secret Service. In 2009, that number fell to 143 million stolen records.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s not clear how much the arrests of Gonzalez and Yastremskiy affected those figures. The Verizon report suggests other possible causes, such as a glut of payment card data on the black market, which has driven down prices and perhaps caused hackers to pause their activities until market conditions improve and higher prices return.
                            </p>
