                                Free Press is still up in arms over what the <a href="http://www.freepress.net/press-release/2010/7/28/closed-door-meetings-continue-fcc-cut-out-public">reform group calls</a> the Federal Communications Commission's "back room" meetings with big corporations to cut a deal on net neutrality rules.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Despite public outrage and repeated promises of transparency, the FCC continues to meet behind closed doors with the largest companies to negotiate a secret deal that would short circuit public participation in policymaking that will shape the Internet for a generation," declared Free Press's Josh Silver in a message just sent to us. "The great irony here is that the FCC's 'transparency' policy is part of the negotiations behind closed doors."
                            </p>

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                We've been <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/06/who-is-attending-these-secret-fcc-net-neutrality-meetings.ars">following this story</a> since late June, when the news first surfaced about these meetings. They don't seem to be related to any single FCC proceeding. Rather, the focus is  on some compromise deal on Internet nondiscrimination rules with which everyone can live, possibly enacted over on Capitol Hill, rather than via the Commission.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Some stakeholders have shared their ideas with staff at the Commission, including ideas for legislative options," FCC Chief of Staff Edward Lazarus wrote on the FCC's blog. "To the extent stakeholders discuss proposals with Commission staff regarding other approaches outside of the open proceedings at the Commission, the agency's <em>ex parte</em> disclosure requirements are not applicable."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lazarus' point here is that since <em>ex parte</em> rules only apply to specific rule-making or inquiry proceedings, the FCC's disclosure rules technically don't apply.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But for "secret," "closed," "back room" meetings, these have been remarkably open affairs. Here's the sordid history of these allegedly clandestine gatherings, summaries of which we found as <a href="http://blog.broadband.gov/?entryId=518087">plain as day</a> on Lazarus' blog.

The attendants included representatives from Verizon, Google, Skype, and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, but it also included a rep from the <a href="http://www.openinternetcoalition.com/index.cfm?objectid=0016502C-F1F6-6035-B1264DD29499E9D0">Open Internet Coalition</a>, which includes Free Press.

                                Sprint showed up on the last Monday of June. As <a href="http://arstechnica.com/telecom/news/2010/07/few-neutrals-in-debate-over-third-way-net-neutrality-plan.ars">we've reported</a>, the company is in sync with general telco opposition to the FCC partially reclassifying ISPs as Title II common carriers, but less vehemently so than AT&amp;T and Verizon. Sprint's big issue is connectivity with those latter companies.

Two days later the NCTA, Verizon, and AT&amp;T <a href="http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=7020529822http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=7020529822">checked in</a> for another meeting.

                            </p>
                            <blockquote>

                                    <li>Concerns that open Internet principles apply solely to lawful content;

                                The latest: on July 23, the June 22 group did a <a href="http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=7020550687">repeat performance</a> of their prior discussions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These conversations have all been earmarked in the FCC's two main net neutrality proceedings—<a href="http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/ecfs/proceeding/view?name=10-127">broadband reclassification</a> and <a href="http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/ecfs/proceeding/view?name=09-191">open Internet proposals</a>. But because they go beyond specific agency rules and deal with ideas for Congressional action, the Commission has more leeway to pick and choose with whom they wish to meet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In that sense, they're less open than normal FCC gatherings, and it's unclear whether other groups are going to get their chance to tell the agency what Congress should do. But if everybody ran their "secret" meetings the way the Commission is running them here, Washington, DC would be a much more transparent place.
