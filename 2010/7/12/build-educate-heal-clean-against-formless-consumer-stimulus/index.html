                                <i>by Jacob Davies</i>
                                <p>
                                    I am not a fan of the word "stimulus". I am not a fan of many of the things done by the previous stimulus bill. When largely-conservative critics of the stimulus complain about the waste inherent in the government borrowing money to do things not worth doing, I sympathize - even as I think the government borrowing money to dig holes and fill them in again would be worth doing because unemployment is so damaging.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But I am not fond of borrowing to spend on unnecessary consumption, especially because right now we are sitting at the end of a multi-decade period of underinvestment in long-term-productive public goods and overconsumption of unproductive private goods - things that don't even make us happier, let alone form part of a sensible investment for the future. Unproductive consumption consists of things like McMansions, expensive cars, and unsustainably bidding up the price of real estate in major cities; it is part of an unwinnable relative-status game that involves destructively spending far more than is necessary on certain goods without receiving any additional utility or welfare in return. We should be trying to find ways to reduce that, not shoveling money out the door to continue it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And few people are full-on Keynesians to the extent of believing in digging holes, I think that's important to recognize politically. Luckily, we have <i>much</i> better ways to stimulate the economy while doing <i>really useful</i> things. As we push for a second major stimulus bill - even in the certain knowledge that it isn't going to happen in the near future, perhaps until another stock market crash - we should talk about what more useful things it could be spent on.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Some of these are "shovel-ready", some are not, but I am not convinced that is a necessary component of stimulus spending. The <i>certain knowledge</i> that the government is going to be spending $10bn a year on a certain type of activity for the next ten years lets private producers invest in new production facilities in anticipation. And as I think we saw from the previous stimulus, the idea that this is a short-term problem requiring only short-term solutions is probably dangerously mistaken. We have a big, long-term problem, and the hope to return to the "normality" of the mid-2000s debt-driven consumption economy is folly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Build</b>
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Europe and Japan have shown that investment in transit - everything from urban light rail to intercity high-speed rail - is economically efficient, supports healthier cities, and, not incidentally, can substantially reduce the use of air transport, with benefits for the environment &amp; oil imports. HSR doesn't work everywhere in the US, but there is enormous opportunity in the eastern &amp; southern US for a system of both "really high speed rail" - TGV-speed, 200mph, requiring new rights of way - and "sort-of high speed rail" - which could run on many existing routes at about 125mph. The US has, even in the built-up northeast, enormous amounts of empty land, spacious city layouts with plenty of room for rail lines, and existing rights of way and stations that could be re-used. The re-railification of America would be a megaproject second only to the Interstate Highway System. We could even figure out some way to make it a private-public partnership if having corporate logos on the trains would make you feel better. (It didn't change anything in Britain, but hey, hope springs eternal.)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Many American schools, hospitals, bridges and civic buildings are decrepit, aging, or outdated structures. Accelerating their replacement over the next 5 years while reducing the number to be replaced in the 5 years after that (which is a natural corollary) provides a nearly ideal profile for stimulus spending. We can borrow cheap now and build new stuff, and not have to build new stuff a few years from now when the economy is hotter and we need to cut spending.
                                    </li>
                                </ul><b>Educate</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In combination with mandatory limits on increases in tuition fees, we could sharply ramp up the amount issued in Pell Grants and direct grants to reduce tuition fees to public universities and colleges. Generally the amount of education delivered is a trade-off against what they could produce by working. In times of high unemployment, people can go to college without losing the opportunity to work, and doing so reduces the number of applicants for jobs while employing people at colleges. It's not free, but it's cheaper than it would be otherwise. Investments in education pay off in lifetime earnings - college grads earn a lot more and therefore pay a lot more in taxes.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Reducing class sizes in urban schools and other underachieving school districts by hiring more teachers and building more schools (largely achievable through state grants). Reduction in class size has a firmly-demonstrated effect on educational achievement, and reductions in school size seem to help too. This is a good time to invest in educating those who are not getting a great education at present; every person who leaves without a high school diploma is another person likely to be out of work and a net economic drag. I don't believe that money can solve all problems related to education, but when it comes to class sizes and school buildings, money helps a hell of a lot.
                                    </li>
                                </ul><b>Heal</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>As we saw from the free clinics organized last year, there are enormous numbers of people in the US who are in desperate need of routine medical care, much of which could be provided by nurses and other non-doctor providers; smart, careful people who are currently out of work could be trained to do simple procedures under the supervision of nurses and doctors. Providing free &amp; low-cost care at clinics that were scaled up, spread across the country, and held on an ongoing basis would not only employ a lot of people, but make a dent in the number of people kept in poverty by illness. Poor, sick people don't pay taxes, buy much, or produce anything useful. We can't afford that.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>This is one that is actually happening, but, high-risk pools for people who are currently uninsured and uninsurable because of chronic disease or risk factors. Doesn't mess with the private market - these people aren't <i>in</i> the private market. And the benefits are clear &amp; fast.
                                    </li>
                                </ul><b>Clean</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The Superfund program is seriously underfunded. A major allocation of funds to it could be used to clean up some of the hundreds of sites across the country that still need it. The long-term benefits are obvious and significant, and there will probably never be a cheaper time to borrow the money to do it.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The Gulf coast will need cleanup efforts &amp; economic support for years to come. BP conveniently will pay for it. This effort should be comprehensive, extensive, and expensive. If that seems unfair, I have to ask: why? BP has made untold billions drilling for oil. They can afford to clean up their mess thoroughly, and there is nothing unfair about them being made to do so.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
