                                    It always seemed to me that "trickle up" makes more sense than "trickle down" as a general economic model for this country (in a general sense, with the particulars up for debate and variation).  Pumping up the demand side is more efficient in many ways: dollars spent by the lower and middle class will go directly into the domestic economy (quickly), and to the companies that offer the most enticing products and services - thus rewarding innovation/efficiency and, in turn, maximizing on capitalism's engine of positive incentives.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On the other hand, pumping money to all companies and wealthy individuals indiscriminately regardless of the soundness of their business models/product offerings, and regardless of their status as industrial mover or mere heir/heiress/gifted athlete/actor/musician, is an inefficient method that rewards too many unproductive individuals/entities. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Further, considering the fact that our economy is consumer/consumption based, it makes more sense to continue to enable consumption, rather than encouraging accumulation of wealth amongst a tiny group of individuals with limited consumption reach.  After all, if the middle/lower class can't consume at a robust enough pace, then no one will be able to purchase the output generated by our businesses, thus creating a negative economic spiral (although sales of luxury items will remain brisk, as well <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/07/businesses-hoarding-cash-is-a-long-term-trend/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+matthewyglesias+%28Matthew+Yglesias%29">hoarding of cash</a> by corporations, as we've seen).

                                <p>
                                    In addition, as a general rule, lower and middle class spenders tend to keep their money/ consumption on the domestic side of the ledger, where as wealthy individuals and corporate interests have more incentive and ability to pursue overseas investments and offshore operations that move jobs and money to other locales - creating a "trickle across" effect that ends up dissipating the benefits.

                                    Regardless of this basic sketch of the dynamic, after a multi-decade supply side experiment, trends are not going in the right direction.  Robert Reich <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-reich/the-root-of-economic-frag_b_644465.html">explains</a>:
                                </p>

                                        Missing from almost all discussion of America's dizzying rate of unemployment is the brute fact that hourly wages of people with jobs have been dropping, adjusted for inflation. Average weekly earnings rose a bit this spring only because the typical worker put in more hours, but June's decline in average hours pushed weekly paychecks down at an annualized rate of 4.5 percent.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In other words, Americans are keeping their jobs or finding new ones only by accepting lower wages.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Meanwhile, a much smaller group of Americans' earnings are back in the stratosphere: Wall Street traders and executives, hedge-fund and private-equity fund managers, and top corporate executives. As hiring has picked up on the Street, fat salaries are reappearing. Richard Stein, president of Global Sage, an executive search firm, tells the New York Times corporate clients have offered compensation packages of more than $1 million annually to a dozen candidates in just the last few weeks.
                                    </p>

                                        We're back to the same ominous trend as before the Great Recession: a larger and larger share of total income going to the very top while the vast middle class continues to lose ground.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And as long as this trend continues, we can't get out of the shadow of the Great Recession. When most of the gains from economic growth go to a small sliver of Americans at the top, the rest don't have enough purchasing power to buy what the economy is capable of producing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        America's median wage, adjusted for inflation, has barely budged for decades. Between 2000 and 2007 it actually dropped. Under these circumstances the only way the middle class could boost its purchasing power was to borrow, as it did with gusto. As housing prices rose, Americans turned their homes into ATMs. But such borrowing has its limits. When the debt bubble finally burst, vast numbers of people couldn't pay their bills, and banks couldn't collect.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Each of America's two biggest economic downturns over the last century has followed the same pattern. Consider: in 1928 the richest 1 percent of Americans received 23.9 percent of the nation's total income. After that, the share going to the richest 1 percent steadily declined. New Deal reforms, followed by World War II, the GI Bill and the Great Society expanded the circle of prosperity. By the late 1970s the top 1 percent raked in only 8 to 9 percent of America's total annual income. But after that, inequality began to widen again, and income reconcentrated at the top. By 2007 the richest 1 percent were back to where they were in 1928--with 23.5 percent of the total.

                                        We all know what happened in the years immediately following these twin peaks--in 1929 and 2008.

                                    The results of favoring the supply side of the equation are predictable, if not necessarily beneficial.  From <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/08/income-gap-between-rich-a_n_639984.html">Laura Bassett</a>:

                                        The gap between the wealthiest Americans and middle- and working-class Americans has more than tripled in the past three decades, according to a June 25 <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/files/6-25-10inc.pdf">report</a> by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        New data show that the gaps in after-tax income between the richest 1 percent of Americans and the middle and poorest parts of the population in 2007 was the highest it's been in 80 years, while the share of income going to the middle one-fifth of Americans shrank to its lowest level ever.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The CBPP report attributes the widening of this gap partly to Bush Administration tax cuts, which primarily benefited the wealthy. Of the $1.7 trillion in tax cuts taxpayers received through 2008, high-income households received by far the largest -- not only in amount but also as a percentage of income -- which shifted the concentration of after-tax income toward the top of the spectrum.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The average household in the top 1 percent earned $1.3 million after taxes in 2007, up $88,800 just from the prior year, while the income of the average middle-income household hovered around $55,300. While the nation's total income has grown sharply since 1979, according to the CBPP report, the wealthiest households have claimed an increasingly large share of the pie. [...] 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        "If income growth had been shared equally among all income groups, the families at the bottom would have $6,000 per year more than they do now, and the middle would have $13,000 more," he said.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Sherman said one key to closing the gap is a responsible tax policy.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        "It would be a big step in the wrong direction to enact proposals like a big rollback in the taxes on the wealthiest estates," Sherman said. "It would probably help to enact some of the middle class tax extender proposals advanced by the President and the Democrats, including things like the extension of the expanded child tax credit."
                                    </p>
