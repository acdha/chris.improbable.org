                                </p>

                                    A couple of recent pieces on Afghanistan have caught my eye, and the ideas expressed therein are worth discussing further considering the wider implications.  First, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2010/07/05/100705taco_talk_packer">George Packer</a> relies on the fact that the Obama administration is pursuing its preferred strategy in Afghanistan as evidence that it is the only feasible strategy that could be pursued:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        No one, however, has been able to come up with an alternative to the current strategy that doesn’t carry great risks. If there were a low-cost way to contain the interconnected groups of extremists in the Hindu Kush—with drones and Special Forces, as Vice-President Biden, among others, has urged—the President would have pursued it. If a return to power of the Taliban, which may well be the outcome of a U.S. withdrawal, did not pose a threat to international security, Obama would have already abandoned Karzai to his fate. <strong>But anyone who believes that a re-Talibanized Afghanistan would be a low priority should read the kidnapping narratives of two American journalists, Jere Van Dyk and David Rohde, who were held by the Taliban, along with the autobiography of the former Taliban official known as Mullah Zaeef. Together, these accounts show that the years since 2001 have radicalized the insurgents and imbued them with Al Qaeda’s global agenda. Tactically and ideologically, it’s more and more difficult to distinguish local insurgents from foreign jihadists</strong>.

                                    Aside from the assumption that a re-Talibanized Afghanistan would necessarily follow our departure (and other <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2009/10/by-eric-martin--onejustification-for-continuingand-possibly-escalating-ourmilitarynon-military-involvement-centers-aroundt.html">related assumptions</a>), aside from Packer's question begging regarding possible alternative strategies (because Obama has thus far not attempted an alternative, therefore none exists - political calculations or errors of judgment are inconceivable) and, aside from what <a href="http://www.progressiverealist.org/blogpost/our-lack-imagination-about-what-do-afghanistan">Michael Cohen</a>  points out as Packer's lack of imagination and, perhaps, inattention to some of the alternatives already proffered, I want to focus on the bolded portion from the above excerpt. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Interestingly, I, too, read Mullah Zaeef's book and came away with a different impression: rather than cast al-Qaeda and the Taliban as indistinguishable, Zaeef describes a tenuous and contingent relationship, with many Taliban leaders blaming al-Qaeda for their loss of power after the commencement of U.S. military activities shortly after 9/11.  That hostility, and the deep regret for allowing al-Qaeda too much latitude pre-9/11, are also recurring sentiments in <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2009/09/25/the-taliban-in-their-own-words.html">this article</a> from <em>Newsweek's</em> Sami Yousafzai which draws upon the experiences of various Taliban figures (excerpted <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2009/10/by-eric-martin--onejustification-for-continuingand-possibly-escalating-ourmilitarynon-military-involvement-centers-aroundt.html">here</a>).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Along these lines, Mullah Omar has been offering signals for <a href="http://lynch.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/10/22/jihadica_online_rifts_between_al_qaeda_and_the_taliban">many months</a> that the Taliban may be looking to <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/al-qaida-prefers-us-to-stick-around/story-e6frg6zo-1225796639320">distance itself</a> from al-Qaeda and may be amenable to a clean break in order to facilitate the departure of foreign armies.  Which is not altogether surprising given the disparate and, at times, contradictory goals and objectives of the two groups and the complicating factor an alliance with al-Qaeda represents for the inwardly facing Taliban (the Taliban are almost entirely concerned with ejecting a foreign army from its soil and retaking control of Afghanistan, and al-Qaeda is intent on attacking foreign elements in a manner likely to invoke wrath and retaliation in the form of prolonged occupations of Muslim lands such as, importantly, Afghanistan). 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/al-qaida-prefers-us-to-stick-around/story-e6frg6zo-1225796639320">Leah Farrall</a> argues, maintaining a U.S. presence in Afghanistan suits al-Qaeda's goals because it creates a cause for jihad - a beacon to attract potential new recruits and a means to ensure al-Qaeda's popularity - but not the Taliban's goals because it prevents that group from consolidating power even in its own regional strongholds.
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        Both of [the Obama administration's] approaches rest on the longstanding premise that al-Qa'ida wants another safe haven in Afghanistan. However, this premise is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of its strategic intentions. Afghanistan's value to al-Qa'ida is as a location for jihad, not a sanctuary. [...]
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This was one of the driving reasons behind Osama bin Laden's decision to attack the US with the specific aim of inciting it to invade Afghanistan. For bin Laden, this created a new, exploitable jihad. Since the US invaded Afghanistan and then Iraq, al-Qa'ida has become the pre-eminent group fighting a self-declared jihad against an occupying force. These invasions allowed al-Qa'ida to exploit allegations that the US was intent on occupying Muslim lands.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A withdrawal of coalition forces from Afghanistan would undoubtedly hand al-Qa'ida and the Taliban a propaganda victory. However, a victory would deny al-Qa'ida its most potent source of power, influence, funding and recruits -- the armed jihad.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Without a jihad to fight, al-Qa'ida would be left with only its franchises -- all of which are involved in deeply unpopular confrontations with government regimes in the Islamic world. Their indiscriminate acts of violence as well as hostility towards other Muslims not sharing their views have badly damaged al-Qa'ida's brand. This has driven al-Qa'ida to refocus on Afghanistan because jihad against an occupying force attracts a level of support and legitimacy that attacking Muslim governments does not. It provides additional justification for al-Qa'ida and those supporting it to continue striking US targets.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A reorientation of US strategy away from counterinsurgency or a full or partial withdrawal of US troops is therefore not in al-Qa'ida's strategic interest. 
                                    </p>

                                    That is not to say that, as in Iraq, insurgent groups have not developed working relationships with al-Qaeda - mostly, but not entirely, out of necessity.  However, like Iraq, bonds formed under such circumstances may very well prove fragile once the primary impetus is removed or is seen to be withdrawing. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Which brings me back to Packer's post.  He claims that since 2001, al-Qaeda and the Taliban have grown closer such that they are, in his words, "difficult to distinguish."  He overstates the case, and deep divisions and divergent goals remain.  Consider, for example, that despite the groups supposedly being indistinguishable, only a small handful of al-Qaeda operatives are currently in Afghanistan (and only a few hundred more in Pakistan).  One would think that such a unified front would allow for more integration.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Consider, also, how many transnational terror attacks these newfangled Afghan foreign jihadists have committed since 2001.  Answer: None.  That should give some indication about the "global" orientation of those Afghan Taliban.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On the other hand, certain Taliban groups have grown closer to al-Qaeda (Haqqani's contingent being one), with such factions likely to prove problematic to any attempt to craft an al-Qaeda-free Afghanistan as part of an eventual negotiated settlement with Taliban leaders. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Regardless of the exact nuances of the dynamic with respect to the various factions, let's assume for the sake of argument that Packer is right in the general sense as he is in a narrow sense about the increasing comingling.  The conclusion that flows from such an observation is that the longer we occupy Afghanistan and force the Taliban and al-Qaeda to make common cause, the greater depth we provide al-Qaeda in terms of manpower, territory and alliances.  Not to mention all the "accidental guerillas" we create through that same occupation (new report on this phenomenon <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/07/civilian-casualties-create-new-enemies-study-confirms/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">discussed here</a>). 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Further, as Leah Farrall argues, our continue presense prevents the very al-Qaeda/Taliban separation that we, ostensibly, should be prioritizing:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        The Afghan Taliban is moving away from al-Qa'ida and redefining itself as a national liberation movement. For al-Qa'ida, Taliban statements condemning colonialism and inviting good relations with its neighbours put a question mark over their relationship. The solution is the same: to attack the US, forcing a surge in American troop numbers.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This would tie the Afghan Taliban's hands. Taliban leader Mullah Omar's legitimacy would be jeopardised were he to publicly disassociate from al-Qa'ida and guarantee he would not again provide it sanctuary. His refusal to do so would then feed the justification for a counterinsurgency campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan, ensuring the US remains engaged in the conflict.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Al-Qa'ida will continue to try to goad the US into staying involved in the conflict because the sustenance and empowerment the conflict gives al-Qa'ida far outweighs the benefits of a safe haven in Afghanistan. Until this is recognised, the strategies the US employs to protect itself from further attacks are likely to inspire more of them and, more importantly, sustain al-Qa'ida. 
                                    </p>

                                    Altogether, those observations seem like very good arguments for disengaging military and, instead of creating a common cause between the Taliban and al-Qaeda, deepening the natural rifts that exist between two groups in pursuit of largely different end games.
