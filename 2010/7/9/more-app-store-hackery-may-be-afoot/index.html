                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Last weekend there were reports that iTunes and the <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/07/04/reports-of-app-store-hacked-greatly-exaggerated/" title="MacRumors: Reports of 'App Store Hacked' Greatly Exaggerated">App Store had been hacked</a>. However, it turned out that a developer had used other users' iTunes accounts to buy his apps repeatedly, quickly moving the apps up the App Store sales ranking. It now appears that another developer, WiiSHii Network, has started doing the same thing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ars reader Harper Reed contacted us to detail the problem. His account was used earlier today to purchase 34 of WiiSHii Network's apps without his permission, for a total of $168.89. The apps appear to mostly be travel guides for cities in China, and come in both English and Chinese versions—oddly enough, Reed ostensibly bought both.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As expected, WiiSHii's apps are now climbing the charts in the travel category. [EN]GYOYO Shanghai Travel Helper and [EN]GYOYO Beijing Travel Helper are currently at number 7 and 8 on the top paid chart for the Travel category, while [CN]GYOYO Beijing Travel Helper is at number 10.

                                        This is one of the iTunes receipts that Reed got quite unexpectedly.
                                    </div>

                                Apple said that the problem last weekend <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38133471/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/" title="MSNBC: Apple says iTunes Store hack damage minimal">only affected 400 accounts</a>, which is a minuscule percentage of iTunes users overall, and the developer at fault was removed from the App Store. It was alleged that affected users had easy-to-guess passwords, and Apple insisted that iTunes servers were not compromised. Reed—an experienced e-commerce developer known for his work with Threadless—told Ars that he is convinced there is a more serious security problem that Apple isn't sharing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Reed's password, a string of random alphanumeric characters, isn't easy to guess, though it is possible that it could be determined by brute force. It seems likely that, even if hackers aren't able to directly access account information directly from iTunes, there is a systematic attempt to acquire valid users' passwords and use the accounts to boost rankings and sales. Worse yet, these same hackers could use the credentials to obtain additional personal information, though iTunes does at least obscure saved credit card numbers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Reed also noted that iTunes customer support is recommending that customers file a fraud complaint with their credit card company or bank, and request a replacement card—hardly a convenient solution. Attempts to contact Apple for comment were unanswered this afternoon.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our advice is to be vigilant about purchases showing up on your iTunes account, and to report any problem to iTunes customer service as soon as possible. If you notice strange app purchases from WiiSHii Network or other developers, let us know in the comments.

                                <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Just days before we were alerted to this problem by Reed, The Next Web <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2010/07/06/hey-apple-look-at-this-another-category-swarming-with-fraudulent-apps/">noticed</a> WiiSHii's apps began dominating the travel category in the UK App Store and suspected the developer of engaging in fraud. Since then, the site has <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2010/07/10/news-is-breaking-of-new-app-store-hacks-we-reported-a-week-ago/">received three reports</a> of fraudulent charges for WiiSHii apps from readers.

                            <p>
                                <strong>UPDATE:</strong> It appears that Apple has removed WiiSHii Network from the App Store.
