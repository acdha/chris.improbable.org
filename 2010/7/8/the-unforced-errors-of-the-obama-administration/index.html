                                <i>by Jacob Davies</i>
                                <p>
                                    First, some disclaimers. I think Barack Obama was clearly the best choice of the Democratic primary candidates, and because I wasn't repeatedly dropped on my head as a baby, I think he was clearly better than the McCain/Palin ticket, in much the same way that a nice hot cup of tea is "better" than having your home planet destroyed by the Death Star.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Still, not everything has gone quite according to plan, and I think some problems could have been avoided.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>1. Full-bore endorsement of the 2008 bank bailout.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Bush was taking the hit for this. McCain was busy grandstanding without having the faintest idea what was going on. Obama could have easily disavowed or at least disparaged the <i>specific</i> bank bailout that was passed while still endorsing the general idea that urgent action needed to be taken. Instead we had a "show of unity" and the banks got a sweet deal with Obama's fingerprints on it. If Obama had said it was a bad deal for the U.S. and that that much money should not be committed without immediate reforms, we'd be in a much better spot now.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>2. Promise of no new taxes on anyone making under $250k.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    People were so sick to death of Republicans by 2008 that you could have told them you were going to take all their stuff and make them work in a labor camp and they'd still have voted for the Democrat. There was no need to make this promise, and it's a stupid promise. Taxes need to be higher in the long term to pay for all the stuff we need. Not just on rich dudes, but on everyone. Higher taxes are not a big deal. You might have to wait another month to buy that 55" TV, but the good news is, your children will get to go to college without bankrupting you, and when you get cancer you won't end up dying homeless in the street. Instead we got reinforcement of the TAXES R EVIL line and a promise almost certain to be broken.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>3. Retention of Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ben Bernanke seems like a real smart guy who understands the Great Depression. He took firm action to try to head off another depression. But he's also a Republican, and now that he's prevented the depression - which any Democratic Fed chairman would have done in exactly the same way - he doesn't seem to really care about restoring full employment. A Democratic Fed chairman could have put more emphasis on employment and less on the banks.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>4. Escalation in Afghanistan.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The American people were also sick to death of overseas adventures by 2009. Nobody would have complained if Obama had said everyone was coming home from Iraq &amp; Afghanistan by the end of 2010. Everyone knew by about 2006 that we weren't going to catch bin Laden, we weren't going to make Afghanistan into a democratic wonderland, and that once the troops come home we were all just going to try to forget about the whole exercise. Everyone, that is, apart from President Obama. Well, stupid plans are still stupid when Democratic Presidents approve them, as it turns out.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>5. Offshore drilling approval.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Thrown out there as a pre-emptive sop to the other side on climate change, without getting a damn thing in exchange. Predictably, achieved nothing. (Sort of like blurting out that you'll work for $5 an hour and M&amp;Ms during a job interview, in the hope that after you get the job they'll provide you with a Lincoln Town Car and a corner office. This is not how negotiation works.) Timing couldn't have been worse with the BP spill demonstrating that the oil industry is still the oil industry about two weeks later.
