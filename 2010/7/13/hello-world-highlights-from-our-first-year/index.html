                                The news applications team has had one hell of a year. Founded last June, we’ve created new ways to tell watchdog stories online, and along the way, dug up and munged, massaged and mapped a mountain of data. And at every step, we’ve given away the data and documented our processes here so that other teams may follow in our footsteps.

                                On July 29, 2009, the Cook County Sheriff’s office released a database of headstones — they were documenting the graves left undisturbed by a group of crooks worthy of a Coen brothers biopic. To help family members learn if their loved ones remains had not been exhumed and their plots resold, we built this <a href="http://burroakmemorial.com/">simple searchable database</a> in a day’s work.

                                To accompany a piece written about excessive and sometimes silly aldermanic spending, we built the <a href="http://councilexpenses2008.apps.chicagotribune.com/">city council expenses application</a>. The original story was good, if predictable: Your alderman spends city money on a fancy car. But, since we published all the data online, many of our readers sent in tips of unusual-looking expenses from their ward — and one hit paydirt. It turns out that <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-08-21/news/0908200927_1_ald-rents-expense-account">one alderman was renting office space from himself</a>. The day one story was about unethical behavior, the day two was about potentially illegal acts. A big win for giving away the data.

                                Nursing facilities in Illinois aren’t just home to the infirm and elderly. They also house angry gang members, convicted sex offenders and volatile psychiatric patients, creating a hidden world of fear and violence. As an accompaniment to more than a dozen hard-hitting investigative reports, <a href="http://nursinghomes.apps.chicagotribune.com/">our unprecedented Web application</a> answered readers’ questions — “Is my father in danger?” “How can I find a safe home for my mother?” — in the most simple fashion possible: a searchable collection of safety reports.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The response -— from government authorities, industry leaders and citizens —- was swift and powerful. On the third day of the series, Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn appointed a Nursing Home Safety Task Force, and within weeks, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-met-nursing-home-bill-20100508,0,3924114.story">sweeping reforms were proposed</a>. And now, a nursing home safety bill is now on the governor’s desk. It will, among many other reforms, require the creation of similar web tools to what we demonstrated with our application. Better software is about to become Illinois law.

                                Tasked with better informing Illinois voters (they’ve made some questionable choices lately), we built the <a href="http://elections.chicagotribune.com/">Election Center</a>: a one-stop-shopping site for Chicagoland and State-wide elections news, polls, Q &amp; A, endorsements and election-day resources. Among the highlights was an online ballot-builder that would guide you from discovering your candidates based on your address, through making a list of your picks to share via Email, Facebook or Twitter. The site changes with the conditions of the day and it’s currently not in full-bloom.

                                Fifty Chicagoans were murdered in June 2010, and a record of each homicide: the name, cause, location, and a story about what happened, can be found on <a href="http://homicides.redeyechicago.com/">RedEye’s homicide application</a>. (The RedEye is a sister publication to the Tribune.) So far, we’ve collected the data back to 2008, and made all of it available for download — which we have recently learned has been of great service to local anti-killing organizations.

                                Rod Blagojevich makes our jobs easy. To bring readers up to speed on his epic governorship, we worked with reporters to dig up stories from our archives — seven years of scandal and dirty dealing — and rolled them up for easy consumption into a <a href="http://media.apps.chicagotribune.com/blago/chronology.html">photo-driven chronology</a>. But as much as we’d prefer the journalism to be our most popular feature, Rod’s upstaged us. Our second piece for the series presents<a href="http://media.apps.chicagotribune.com/blago/documents.html">documents from the courtroom, including transcripts plus audio</a> of such memorable moments as <a href="http://media.apps.chicagotribune.com/blago/5094-session-281-blagojevich-home-nov-5-2008.html#document/p3">“You Russian motherfuckers” and “I’ve got this thing and it’s fucking… golden.”</a> And the readers have spoken, the numbers are ridiculous — it’s our most popular work yet.
