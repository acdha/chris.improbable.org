                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I believe the term of art to describe <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/the-arrogant-david-brooks-tells-readers-that-stimulus-will-risk-national-insolvency">Dean Baker's treatment</a> of a recent David Brooks offering on economic policy&nbsp;is "evisceration":
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        David Brooks has decided to jump into the debate over stimulus with both feet. In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/06/opinion/06brooks.html?hp">column</a> in which he warns against arrogance he tells readers that additional stimulus would: "risk national insolvency on the basis of a model."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Mr. Brooks doesn't tell readers how he has determined that further stimulus carries this risk. He doesn't explain how raising the country's debt to GDP ratio by 4-8 percentage points over the next few years would jeopardize the creditworthiness of the U.S. government. This is certainly a rather strong assertion, given that even with this additional indebtedness, the debt-to-GDP ratio in the United States would still be far lower than it had been at prior points in its history.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Even after a decade of accumulating debt at a rapid pace, the U.S. would still face a lower debt burden than countries like Italy do today. Italy is currently able to borrow in financial markets at very low interest rates. Projections for 2020 show that the debt burden of the United States would still be less than half of the current debt burden of Japan, which still pays less than 2.0 percent interest on its long-term debt.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Financial markets also don't seem to share Mr. Brooks view that national insolvency is a serious concern. The people who are putting their money on the line are willing to buy 10-year Treasury bonds at just 3.0 percent interest rates. That would seem to suggest that insolvency is not a real concern, but Mr. Brooks insists that President Obama should hesitate on stimulus because he thinks that insolvency is a problem anyhow, and the people who disagree with him are arrogant. [...]
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After inventing a crisis of national insolvency to concern the president (should President Obama also worry about invading Martians?), Mr. Brooks tells readers that:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        "The Demand Siders donâ€™t have a good explanation for the past two years."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Hmmm, is that right? Seems to me that we have a very simple theory to explain the past two years. There was a huge bubble in housing that burst beginning in 2006. This led to a plunge in residential construction that cost the economy more than $500 billion in annual demand. In addition, the loss of $6 trillion in housing wealth, coupled with the loss of around $7 trillion in stock wealth, has cost the economy more than $500 billion in annual consumption demand. This is the result of the wealth effect on consumption, a phenomenon that economists have been writing about for close to a century. In addition, there was a bubble in non-residential real estate that collapsed about a year after the collapse of the housing bubble. This cost the economy about another $150 billion in demand. That gives a total loss in annual demand of around $1.2 trillion. All of this was completely predictable and <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=405">predicted by at least some demand siders</a>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It was also easy to see that the stimulus approved by Congress was inadequate. Demand siders rely on something called "arithmetic" to reach this assessment. After pulling out the $80 billion fix to the alternative minimum tax, which had nothing to do with stimulus, and the $100 billion or so designated for later years, the stimulus provided for roughly $600 billion in spending and tax cuts over the years 2009 and 2010. This comes to $300 billion a year. Roughly half of the federal stimulus was offset by cutbacks and tax increases at the state and local level, leaving a net stimulus from the government sector of roughly $150 billion a year.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Demand siders <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/the-state-and-local-drag-on-the-stimulus/">did not believe that $150 billion in annual stimulus from the government</a> could offset the contractionary impact of a reduction in annual spending by the private sector of $1.2 trillion ($1.2 trillion &gt; $150 billion). That is how demand siders explained the failure of the stimulus to have much impact in reducing the unemployment rate. Perhaps this explanation is too complicated for Mr. Brooks (he repeatedly complains about the high IQs of the demand siders), but it actually seems fairly straightforward. If he wants to be honest, he could at least say that he doesn't understand the demand siders' explanation, rather than asserting that demand siders do not have an explanation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Brooks has also developed his own theory of consumer and investment behavior. He decided that consumers are not spending because of concerns about the debt. This is an interesting theory. Consumer spending is probably still somewhat higher than would be expected given the loss of stock and housing wealth. (The savings rate is between 4-5 percent, compared to a long-term average that is more than 8.0 percent.) Furthermore, with many experts and media pundits (like Mr. Brooks) insisting that the government must cut Social Security and Medicare, it is really surprising that the huge cohort of baby boomers approaching retirement is spending as much as they are. In short, it doesn't seem like the evidence fits Mr. Brooks theory very well.

                                    There were at least two things that were entirely predictable, and predicted, during the Bush administration's tenure:

                                    1. The Party of "deficits don't matter" would become <em>hyperconcernd</em> with deficits and the debt once they no longer held the White House (and once back in power, again, deficits wouldn't matter).&nbsp; But for now, this disingenuous argument is all the rage at&nbsp;a time when increased government spending is vital to juicing the demand side which is lagging in the throes of a global slog.

                                    2. The large debt built up during the Bush years (with big contributions from tax cuts <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61178-2004Aug12.html">primarily benefitting</a> the uber wealthy, and two wars - at least one of which was entirely pointless and unnecessary) would be used to justify the "unfortunate" need to cut social security - taking advantage of serendipitous timing&nbsp;of the impending baby boomer coming of age.

                                        It has been the stated and unstated goal of conservatives in America to undo the legacies of the liberal policies enacted under the rubric of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's visionary New Deal and Lyndon Johnson's bold Great Society. The elimination of these programs is a central tenet of the goal to shrink the size of the federal government, to "starve the beast" and usher in an era of truly small government. The two most prominent survivors of this siege, Social Security and Medicare, have been the nemeses of conservative lawmakers, almost since their inception... They represent the last vestige of the American voters' refusal to vote against their interest. [...]

                                        A frontal assault on Medicare and Social Security has proven impossible to mount, and certain political suicide for those that try. But perhaps there is another way - a back door of sorts.

                                    That back door would involve a massive tax redistribution to the wealthiest Americans, followed by a spike in spending (much of it on the defense side), at a time when economic conditions would suggest that spending should&nbsp;be tightened and tax cuts put off indefinitely.&nbsp;

                                    Even&nbsp;with large deficits and debt,&nbsp;though, taking the scalpel to Social Security would be a hard political sell.&nbsp; Presumably.&nbsp; However, the one&nbsp;aspect of this predictable&nbsp;sequence that&nbsp;has&nbsp;caught&nbsp;me off guard is that&nbsp;a Democratic administration has <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/07/debt-commission-eying-mostly-cuts-package/">been</a> so <a href="http://emptywheel.firedoglake.com/2010/07/09/breaking-bob-corker-kills-the-catfood-commission/">complicit</a> in the selling.&nbsp; Let's hope the Obama administration doesn't really intend to&nbsp;follow through with such political, and policy, folly.
