                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                So, I’ve been working on sf.net in various ways for about a year now.<br>
                                <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/">http://sourceforge.net/p/</a>. It’s written in Python using modern open source tools, from RabbitMQ, and MongoDB, to Git and Mercurial. And we are committed to making this the most open forge possible. We’re committed, to open processes, open code, and perhaps most importantly open data.<br>
                                <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mramm/todo/"><img src="http://compoundthinking.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/tickets.jpg" alt="" title="tickets" width="400" height="315" align="right"></a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first thing we did was create some new pages for downloads. Recently we releases <a href="http://sourceforge.net/downloads">a new service</a> designed just for open source project leaders who want to use <a href="http://compoundthinking.com/sf.net/directory">sf.net</a> as a directory and downloads service.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But, we’re also aware that one of the most important services we provide is project hosting. For the last several months a small group of us have been trying to bring sourceforge.net’s tools into 2010. And now we’re releasing an early preview of those new developer/community tools:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We have a long way still to go, but every long journey begins with a single step, and today’s step is allowing you to try the new forge, to create new projects at:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="https://sourceforge.net/register">https://sourceforge.net/register</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Where you can go to get a new project, with our new tracker, wiki, git, svn, and other tools. Projects can have subprojects, and links to other tools hosted off site, along with the many features that sf.net brings (free web hosting, hosted apps, etc).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>But, why do all this?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>In 1999 SourceForge was cool.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It provided all the tools that an open source project needed to get going, from cvs hosting, to bug tracking, and e-mail list support.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They pioneered free free software project hosting, and helped to transform the software development culture from one which barely new about free software or open source, to one where nearly everybody I know uses open license software. Oh sure, some of them might not know it, but they have it on their phones, in their TVs, their wireless routers — not to mention all the websites they use everyday that run on open source.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>But, time passed.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                More alternatives came out, more projects (including my own) started self hosting, and the landscape of open source software development changed. SourceForge.net took a long time coming out with support for new tools like svn, and then git.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Still, SourceForge has a special place in my heart. Partly it’s nostalgia, I suppose, but I still think:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>the core mission is still right
                                </li>
                                <li>and there is still a real need
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                We (Open Source developers) still need tools like git, mercurial, and svn hosting. We still need bug trackers and mailing lists. And in a meeting of other open source project leaders last fall, nearly every single one of them identified the time wasted integrating and administering these tools as one of their most important frustrations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Not enough…</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But, for many sourceforge.net and other free project hosting services were just not good enough, they weren’t scriptable, the weren’t extensible, their data wasn’t portable, and so they felt like they had to take on that cost.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And I fundamentally believe that open source projects live an die by communication, and that sourceforge.net can do something new by integrating the various kinds of “conversations” that happen around the project. We can integrate mailing lists and forums, we can integrate SCM and ticket trackers, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>New and improved</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, a couple of us have been quietly working on something new. The new forge is designed around a few core ideas:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>that data should be portable (every project gets their own database, which they can take with them if they want),
                                </li>
                                <li>that the open source community ought to be able to extend and enhance the tools they need,
                                </li>
                                <li>that integrating and cross linking the various kinds of conversations that open source projects need to have ought to be easier.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                So, what we’re announcing today is more of a commitment to getting there on all these things, and a commitment to the “release early, release often” project management strategy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, expect us to take your feedback and make things better. Expect us to release lots of small fixes, and expect a few places where things are broken/incomplete because we value feedback more than polish at this point.
                            </p>
