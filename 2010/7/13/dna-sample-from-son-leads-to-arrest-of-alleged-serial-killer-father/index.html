                            This is another example of an area where the allow/ban division used to structure the story hinders real solutions. This technology seems to useful to prevent it being used (imagine the PR campaign any time it might have helped) and there aren't enough strong libertarians to sustain a ban on philosophical grounds - we should be talking about strong oversight and punishment for misuse, which we might actually get.

                                Authorities in California arrested an alleged serial killer after matching a DNA sample from his incarcerated son to crime-scene evidence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The relatively new familial-DNA search technique is a controversial method that critics say raises ethical and legal questions that need to be examined by legislators.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lonnie David Franklin, Jr., was arrested July 7 on suspicion that he was the so-called “Grim Sleeper” serial killer, allegedly responsible for killing nearly a dozen women in Los Angeles over a period of 25 years. The gruesome name stems from the fact that the killer took a break from murder for a dozen years at one point before resuming his killing spree.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Police had forensic evidence from the crime scenes, but no match to suspects in the FBI’s DNA database, which contains samples from anyone arrested on suspicion of committing a felony crime. Then last year Franklin’s son Christopher was incarcerated on a felony weapons conviction. When police ran a so-called “familial search” of the database to find a match with the Grim Sleeper’s DNA, they got a match on Christopher.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The FBI DNA database, CODIS, contains the genetic fingerprint of millions of people who have been arrested or convicted of a felony. The database initially contained only DNA profiles of people convicted of violent felonies, but it expanded to include anyone arrested under suspicion of committing a felony. A disproportionate number of people with profiles in the database are African American.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The database allows police to compare crime-scene DNA samples to the genetic profiles of people who have been previously arrested.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But states have begun allowing authorities to conduct “partial” and “familial” searches in the database to expand the scope of the database.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Partial matches are fortuitous matches that come about unintentionally when conducting a search for a complete match and can uncover people who share part of their DNA makeup with the unknown suspect who left evidence at the crime scene. Familial matches are intentional searches that are usually conducted with special software. Both can allow authorities to widen their search capability to people who may not be in the DNA database — such as parents, siblings and children who have never been arrested but share a good chunk of their DNA with someone who has been arrested and is in the database.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When authorities run an intentional familial search from evidence left at a crime scene and find an incomplete DNA match in the database, the owner of the DNA sample in the database may not have committed the crime, but it’s possible that a relative is the real offender. By then doing DNA testing on relatives, police can ferret out their suspect.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2256966/pagenum/all/#p2">critics say these searches may not be legal</a>. In a column published in Slate last month, two co-authors said that the method allows authorities to increase the scope of the database to cover millions of innocent people never arrested or even suspected of a crime who are then potentially targeted for investigation simply by virtue of sharing DNA with someone. And because the technique is so new, there are no regulations governing when and how it can be used.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Courts have held that convicts and arrestees have a lower expectation of privacy than ordinary citizens and that the state has a weighty interest in identifying criminals and preventing recidivism. On balance, courts have determined, these factors permit offenders’ DNA profiles to be stored in CODIS. But none of these reasons justifies collecting information about offenders’ kin. Directly including the DNA of innocent family members in CODIS would be unlawful under existing statutes and likely prohibited under current Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. And if actually including them in the database is prohibited, shouldn’t their effective inclusion be so too?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The police may argue that familial searching and partial matching present no Fourth Amendment problems, since nothing has actually been seized from the relatives and they have not been personally searched. In a sense, they are correct—the family members aren’t actually in CODIS—but they are nonetheless “reachable” through a profiled relative. Their inclusion is virtual, a product of biological happenstance. But this end-run shouldn’t satisfy lawmakers: If offenders’ relatives are to be treated like offenders, there must be a good reason to single them out. There is none.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                While searching the DNA database in this way doesn’t amount to a literal Fourth Amendment violation, critics say it constitutes an end-run around the law.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “This does not violate the US Constitution’s Fourth Amendment protections against unlawful search and seizure,” says Tod Burke, professor of criminal justice at Radford University in Virginia <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/0708/Grim-Sleeper-case-raises-privacy-concerns-over-use-of-DNA">told the <em>Christian Science Monitor</em></a>“But the bigger question is moral and legal: Is this Big Brother? And the answer really is, ‘Yes.’ ”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Given that most of DNA profiles in the database belong to African Americans, they are <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/07/08/familial.dna/?hpt=C2">more likely to be affected by familial searches</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Race is a big issue; it’s a legitimate question to address, and it’s a troubling fact,” said Hank Greely, a Stanford University Law School professor told CNN. “We can talk all day long about why it is that more African-Americans are arrested, but the fact is that the database reflects that. Inevitably that means familial DNA matching will net more African-Americans than any other group of people.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                California Attorney General Jerry Brown approved the use of familial DNA searches in that state in 2008, the first state to do so. Since then, authorities in the state have used the technique 10 times. Other states have tacitly allowed the procedure, without having any regulation or even formal policy in place to govern its use.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The U.S. isn’t the first to use the technique, however. The United Kingdom has conducted familial DNA searches 70 times since 2004, yielding 18 matches and 13 convictions, according to Jeffrey Rosen, a law professor at Georgetown University Law School, who <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/07/08/familial.dna/?hpt=C2">spoke with CNN</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In one case, UK authorities tracked down a serial rapist using the technique. The culprit, who became known as the shoe rapist because police say he stole and kept his victims’ shoes, was caught after authorities <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article689011.ece">matched crime-scene DNA with the rapist’s sister</a>, who was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving.
