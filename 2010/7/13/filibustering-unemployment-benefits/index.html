                                The filibuster has become such a routinely used tool, that reporters now speak of 60 votes required to pass nearly anything through the US Senate. &nbsp;I'm temperamentally conservative, so I'm loathe to get rid of procedures. &nbsp;But I'm temperamentally conservative, so I don't like seeing the social conventions against using emergency measures only during emergencies ignored such that emergency measures become routine. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                                <br>
                                But before we decide to get rid of the filibuster entirely, we need to look at why it has become so ugly. &nbsp;The reason is simple. &nbsp;It is an emergency measure, with a theoretically legitimate use to keep an under-debated topic under consideration for debate. &nbsp;In theory, it is a strong statement by a Senator that this particular topic is so important that he is willing to devote all of his time to keeping the debate open. If 60 Senators disagree, they can shut him up, and bring the matter to vote.<br>
                                <br>
                                That is the filibuster in theory. &nbsp;In recent practice, no one really debates in a filibuster. &nbsp;They just threaten to debate, and the majority gives up until they can get 60 votes. &nbsp;The reason it has become so common, is that if the minority party is never called on it, it is essentially costless. &nbsp;They can threaten to debate, and instead of needing a 51% majority, they just need a 41% minority to defeat bills. &nbsp;<br>
                                <br>
                                An excellent explanation of this is found at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.themonkeycage.org/2009/08/well_how_did_we_get_here_the_r.html">The Monkey Cage</a>:<br>
                                &nbsp;
                                <blockquote>
                                    &nbsp; Just as there is more than one way to filibuster, there is more than one way to defeat a filibuster. I classify them as “closure” (a classic term meaning any rule for bringing about a decisive vote), “reform” (changing the rules, or making an unorthodox use of existing rules), and “attrition.” Attrition means that the coalition seeking to pass a bill remains in the chamber, dragging out the debate until the obstructionists are tired, have run out of opportunities to speak (there’s a limit of two speeches per topic), or leave an opening to start a vote—once a vote starts, it cannot be stopped. Attrition was the typical response to a filibuster before the Senate had a cloture rule and, as Gregory Wawro and Eric Schickler demonstrate, majorities did not NEED a closure process to win before 1917 (although Wawro and Schickler emphasize the role of informal norms as a restraint on pre-1917 obstruction).<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The 1939 movie “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” concludes with a very realistic depiction of 1930s style attrition. Smith gains the recognition of the chair and begins speaking from his desk.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    And Smith speaks through the night. His speech doesn’t have to be about the appropriations bill on the floor, so he can read from books, talk about the Constitution, etc. And, periodically, he can note the absence of a quorum and compel the other senators to show up in the Senate and prove there are enough senators around to conduct business.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But after a few hours, Smith is exhausted. And public opinion (“astroturfed” in the movie) has arrived in the form of telegrams, telling Smith to quit.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Note, though, that the senators do NOT file a cloture petition, wait two days, and then vote. That would take too long, and would force them to vote to stop a filibuster. Attrition, even if it means lost sleep or a nap on an army cot, is preferable. Second, a filibuster is a public event: the media perks up at the outbreak of a filibuster (as they had when Huey Long was entertaining them from 1933 to 1935), and the filibuster is Smith’s means of “expanding the game” to allow the public to weigh in on the Senate’s proceedings with editorials and telegrams.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    ...<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So why did the Senate change? The stock answer is that the chamber’s responsibilities grew with the size and scope of the federal government, so it became more costly to sit around watching obstructionists kill time. There is some truth in that explanation. Also, however, senators’ work habits changed. The introduction of railroads, cars, and (especially) air travel made sitting around in the Senate chamber so…boring. Tedious. Totally lame. During the mid-20th century, the Senate increasingly became a Tuesday-Thursday club, and individual senators began insisting that major legislation be kept from the floor to accomodate their travel schedules. A serious attrition effort would mean cancelled speeches in Manhattan and Chicago, no trips to the Delaware coast, and waiting longer to return to the ranch back in Texas.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Several stock explanations do NOT have a significant effect in my analysis: Senate turnover, partisanship, and the threat of reform are not strongly correlated with Senate filibustering (1901-2004). Most cloture rule changes (1917, 1949, 1959) have no clear effect, while the 1975 change is correlated with an INCREASE in filibustering. One reform that did matter was the 20th amendment, which cut down on filibustering during the final months of each Congress by changing the Congressional schedule.<br>
                                    ...<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The perceived relationship may also stem from the adoption of cloture as the dominant response to a filibuster. The necessary condition for an old-school attrition filibuster was a team of intense warriors ready to defy the rest of the chamber—“a little group of willful men” as Woodrow Wilson put it. These groups were typically identified in press reports by ideology (liberals, conservatives, progressives), region (Southerners, Westerners, etc.), or policy preference (isolationists). Even filibusters conducted on behalf of a party (say, to forestall an investigation into a questionable election) were carried out by a few senators identified by name.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Once cloture became the test of a filibuster, however, the necessary condition for a successful floor filibuster was a coalition big enough to prevent cloture. In the context of a Senate that is polarizing for other reasons (hint: not because of redistricting), this increasingly means uniting one party or the other behind a filibuster.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                </blockquote>Essentially, Senators filibuster so often now because it is so easy to do. &nbsp;If you don't want filibusters to be routine, you have to make them cost more than just a simple vote. &nbsp;At some point you have to test the threat of a filibuster with attrition. &nbsp;But to do so requires that the majority break the filibuster on something they are willing to take a stand on, and that they are willing to put in the few days of constant work required to break the back of a stupid filibuster. &nbsp;<br>
                                <br>
                                I believe that Democrats have been unwilling to do so because either they are lazy, or because they are scared. &nbsp;If it turns out that it is because they are merely lazy, there isn't much we can do about it. &nbsp;So I will operate under the assumption that they are scared. &nbsp;The fact is that the trend of elections during a recession is worse for incumbents than just about any other scenario. &nbsp;See for example this by&nbsp;<a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/07/whos-going-win-year">Kevin Drum</a>.<br>
                                &nbsp;<br>
                                Fair or not, people tend to blame incumbents for the current state of the economy. &nbsp;So Democrats ought to be very scared for their seats. &nbsp;But this brings us to the recent votes on unemployment benefits. Republicans have offered a perfect opportunity for Democrats to portray Republicans as heartless SOBs who would rather let people suffer in misery that they themselves can't fix, during the middle of the deepest recession since World War II. &nbsp;Until Byrd died, there were 60 votes for the unemployment extension. &nbsp;But when he died, Republicans threatened a filibuster. &nbsp;<br>
                                <br>
                                Democrats should have taken them up on it. &nbsp;They need a key issue to remind voters of how Republicans helped get us here, and how their responses aren't making things better. &nbsp;Making individual Republicans stand and debate about how the unemployed don't need benefits couldn't possibly lose net centrist voters. &nbsp;Get a few good video editors. &nbsp;Plaster the worst offenders all over youtube. &nbsp;Break the back of the routine filibuster without killing it for real emergencies. &nbsp;Win more votes. &nbsp;<br>
                                <br>
                                Or just continue whining. &nbsp;<br>
                                <br>
                                UPDATE: I understand that WV is rushing a Senator in for the Unemployment extension vote. &nbsp;That's great, but if you don't get 60 votes, make the Republicans talk. &nbsp;Hell don't even ask for cloture. &nbsp;Propose a vote and make them talk until attrition wins it for you.
