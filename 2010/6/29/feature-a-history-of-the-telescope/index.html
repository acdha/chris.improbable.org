                                Astronomy. What's the first thing you think of when you read that word? The many beautiful vistas returned from Hubble? A family in a backyard huddled around a small telescope? Giant research observatories such as the Keck? Whatever may come to mind, it usually involves a telescope. But the very nature of telescopes has changed over the centuries, with different arrangements of lenses dominating for decades before succumbing to some combination of basic physics or technical limitations. &nbsp;We'll (somewhat belatedly) celebrate the 400th anniversary of Galileo's telescope by taking you on a quick tour of four centuries of progress and frustration.

                                The birth of the lens
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                As early as the thirteenth century, artisans in Venice and Florence were producing seeing glasses for elderly presbyopic (long-sightedness caused by age) scholars. Magnifying glasses were common among universities and monasteries at the dawn of the fourteenth century, where they became a symbol of wisdom and respect. These glasses were held against the eye, where, due to their small size and rounded shape, they were named "lentils of glass" or, in the latin, "lenses."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The glass wasn't good by modern standards, having inclusions of air bubbles and a notably greenish tint from iron. By 1350, when we see them appear in illustrations, the two-lensed spectacle had been invented in Venice and rapidly became a sign of education and wisdom among the scholars and noble elite of the day.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The fifteenth century saw the convex lens' opposite appear: the concave lens for myopia, a vision impairment of the young. We have documentation of these being available as early as 1450. The problem solved, nobody seemed to hold any further interest in optics until Thomas Digges, the first astronomer to attempt a measurement of parallax.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Digges (or his son Leonard, or both—it isn't clear) used a convex lens and a concave mirror to magnify distant objects, but the shortcomings of such an arrangement were obvious: the observer was in the way of the mirror. His device was forgotten, and Digges was best remembered for his popularization of the heliocentric system.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 1608, Hans Lipperhey in the Netherlands applied for a patent on a pair of lenses, one with a much shorter focal length than the other, arranged in a tube. He called it a "spyglass" as it allowed the observation of greatly distant events from a secluded retreat—Lipperhey noted that counting coins from afar was a suitable use. The patent was denied because the device was so very easily constructed. Lipperhey's design was biconcave, two concave lenses arranged so as to compress incoming light into a smaller area, where it would appear magnified.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By early 1609, small spyglasses of two to three powers were being produced by the spectacle makers of Paris and Venice. By mid-1609, they were dotted around France and Italy. In August 1609, Thomas Harriot is known to have turned such a spyglass on the Moon, but with only three powers, he was unable to correctly discern craters and mountains. Such a feat would require at least five to six powers.

                                The spyglass meets astronomy
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                We need to go back further, though, to see why the telescope was even necessary for astronomy, as obvious as it may seem to the modern reader. Tycho Brahe and his contemporaries didn't have telescopes, but they did have similar devices to enhance the precision of the eye. A <a href="http://www.aip.org/history/cosmology/tools/tools-nakedeyes.htm">wall quadrant</a> such as the one Brahe invented (though 'built' may be the better word) could be used to derive the position of a celestial object with great accuracy using no more than one's naked eye—greater accuracy than a 5 power telescope could manage alone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The positions that allowed Kepler to nearly derive Newton's law of universal gravitation were taken using such a device. Even "almost derive" was good enough; Kepler's Laws (strictly a special case of Newton's Universal Gravitation where one mass is irrelevant) were enough to give him a place in the history books, even though he never had the benefit of a telescope.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was this wall quadrants device that gave birth to the astronomical telescope. One does not compare the car to the industrial steam engine, even though they share great commonality—one instead compares it to the horse and coach. Astronomy's horse and coach were the quadrants, its car was the telescope; they may be entirely unrelated devices in operation, but they were put to use for the same purpose.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The big breakthrough came when Galileo was informed of Lipperhey's failure to secure a patent. He was certainly aware of the Venetian prowess in lens grinding, as well as work in optics that Kepler had done. Galileo decided to make such a device for himself, inspired by a mixture of Renaissance gung-ho and a desire to make his name. Presumably, he reasoned that a device able to magnify distant objects would also minimize the uncertainty in their position, providing an improved version of the wall quadrant.

                                What his telescope gave him was nothing short of astonishing: far from simple positions, Galileo discovered mountains on the moon, <a href="http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Smoon4.htm">librations</a> that proved the Moon was spherical and not a flat disc, moons of Jupiter that flew in the face of contemporary Catholic thought, and a view of the Milky Way that indicated it wasn't an "atmospheric phenomena," but rather was made of countless faint stars. The unquestionably true dogma of many Christians was now unquestionably false. Galileo began to question the knowledge of Ptolemy, Plato, Pythagoras and Aristotle, setting into motion the golden age of astronomy and its ascendance to being a true science.

                            <p>
                                Galileo's telescopes were nothing spectacular—any ten year old child can easily put together a far better instrument using modern glass—but Galileo had access (via the influence of his various patrons) to the very best lensmakers of the day. Galileo's device was a 20-magnification instrument that used a convex objective lens and a concave ocular lens. This design was the only real workable telescope of the day. His only innovation was the magnification of the instrument: in a day where most were between three and eight powers, Galileo had twenty.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This telescope was not without its problems. The objective lens had a focal length of roughly 800 mm, the ocular lens around 50 mm, but the glass used was full of bubbles, tinted green due to iron, and only good as an optical instrument near the center. Galileo and most contemporaries had to stop-down their objective lenses to an aperture no more than 25 mm to avoid unacceptable images. A 20-power telescope was about the best a 25 mm aperture could be used with before the image becomes dull, loses contrast, and cannot show faint objects.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not only that, but Galileo's device had a tiny field of view, roughly 10 arcminutes, so it couldn't even fit in half the moon. As the magnification went up (Galileo himself experimented with a 40 power instrument and found it only barely usable) the field of view went down. Galileo's telescope did have one saving grace: it produced erect images because it never brought the light to a focus. Parallel rays entering the telescope were still parallel when they left (which indicates a telescope in focus), and had not "crossed over" at a focal point.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With astronomy being so revolutionary, there were no end of patrons willing to sponsor an astronomer's discoveries in their name. Who wouldn't want their name permanently affixed in the very heavens? This led to rich backers starting a telescopic arms race.

                                Changing lenses
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Kepler had written in 1611 that a convex ocular placed after the focal point of the objective would produce an image, but this approach had not caught on, as the lenses of the time were very poor and people found it easier to aim a scope that produced a direct image. Doubly convex telescopes today are known as "Keplerian," as opposed to the concave ocular of the Galilean. Galileo used plano-concave lenses with a concave and a planar surface (two concave surfaces is "biconcave"), as these were the easiest to grind to accurate spherical curves. Kepler suggested the use of plano-convex lenses instead. Kepler's design had the additional benefit of an innately longer focal length, as the rays were brought to a focus inside the telescope and the ocular lens was after the focal point. This gave greater magnification.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's possible to flip the image upright again with an additional lens and this was known as early as Kepler's time. But the requirement for a third lens to erect the image was a major drawback; two lenses were bad enough given the quality of glass in the day—three was a deal-breaker. However, lenses continued to improve, and Christoph Scheiner's work <em>Rosa Ursina</em> in 1630 described the doubly convex telescope again—this time, it caught on. Scheiner had been trying to make a device which would project an erect image of the Sun, but, when he looked through it, he saw the image was not only brighter and clearer than a Galilean telescope, but he had a much wider field of view.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With these advantages in hand, the magnification limitations of the Galilean telescope (where a higher power would cause a corresponding drop in field of view) were lifted. Now, all that held an astronomer back was the simple ratio of the focal lengths. For example, this author's Newtonian reflector has a focal length of 900 mm. The ocular lens most commonly used has a 20 mm focal length. 900/20 = 45. 45 power is about right for most observing, though a 12.5 mm lens is available should a 72 power be needed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the magnification that keeps many backyard amateurs happy today wasn't enough for 17th century astronomers, which meant that telescopes started to become very, very long. Galileo made telescopes no more than about one and half meters long but, by 1656, Christiaan Huygens had made a 100 power telescope that was 7 meters (23 feet) long, with an aperture of about 150 mm (6 inches). That's roughly equal (in magnification, at least) to entry level amateur telescopes today.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The telescopic arms race had only just started.

                                The field lens was placed at the focal point of the objective and had the effect of bending rays that would otherwise miss the ocular, redirecting them to the ocular. Of course (hence the name) this greatly expanded the field of view. Without a field lens, it wasn't possible to use very short focal lengths on the ocular (and hence higher magnifications) since the field of view would shrink to almost nothing.

                                With a field lens, telescopes could become extremely long to accommodate an objective with a ridiculously long focal length. This also minimized optical defects in the objective, as the grinding techniques of the time dictated that a flatter lens had fewer defects and was more accurate—very large and very flat lenses were the order of the day. These telescopes were very difficult to use, as the slightest breeze or touch translated into a vibrating image. The magnifications were so high that any tiny motion was amplified just as much.

                                Coming to the rescue was Christiaan Huygens, already known for producing highly capable instruments, who developed the aerial telescope. Here, the objective lens is suspended on a pole or the side of a building and the ocular and field lenses are in a separate, small tube, long enough to eliminate stray light, but still only a few feet long. Between the eyepiece assembly and the objective lens was nothing but free air. The objectives were mounted on a hinge or ball bearings and rotated by means of two strings (or, in some cases, a ladder and a boy!). The focal point could be found during the day by seeing where the Sun's rays would converge.

                                Until this point, magnifications had become high, but aperture had kept up (a rule of thumb is 50x per 25 mm or one inch), so the images remained sharp and clear. However, Descartes, Snell, and others had seen that new telescopes were returning poor results; when used at their best power, they were blurred and suffered color fringing. The sinusoidal nature of refraction was quantified by Snell as Snell's Law, while Descartes quantified spherical aberration. Descartes, Snell, and Beeckman showed that the way forward was a plano-hyperbolic lens, where the surface of the lens describes a hyperbola, a special case of an ellipse with an eccentricity of one, the distance between each focal point of the ellipse being infinite. Snell also discovered that an easier lens to produce was spherico-ellipsoidal, and that this too would eliminate spherical aberration.

                                Try as they might, lens grinders could not produce an optically sound plano-hyperbolic or spherico-ellipsoidal lens that would be immune to spherical aberration. All their tools and equipment were designed to create spherical lenses, and other ellipses were just not possible with that tooling. While Descartes could model hyperbolae in mathematics fluently, this did not translate into better lens grinding.

                                In 1672, Newton had published his description of chromatic aberration, which seemed to mean the lenses were living on borrowed time. Even his brilliant mind could not find any combinations of lenses to bring all the colors to the same focus, and the problem of chromatic aberration became something of an obsession for Newton.

                                It had been known since the most ancient of times that a concave mirror would focus light (it has even been suggested that the Greeks used them as heat ray weapons!) and some had attempted to create a telescope with them, but they made little progress. &nbsp;They had no idea how to shorten the focal length—a lens can be put out in front, but a mirror has to go behind.

                                Even before Newton, many had attempted to use a curved mirror (such as Digges). Newton eventually solved the chromatic aberration problem with a spherical mirror, his prototype being a two inch diameter polished alloy of copper and tin known then as speculum metal. This ingeniously solved the focal length problem of a rear mirror by reflecting the focal plane 90 degrees using a 45 degree plane mirror. Then, a simple plano-convex lens, which had been available at reasonable qualities for some time, would serve as the ocular.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Other than causing a minor wave of interest at the Royal Society, Newton's reflecting telescope was little more than a curiousity with severe flaws. The mirror would quickly tarnish, and silvered glass mirrors, which wouldn't tarnish, were both entirely unsuitable and very much in their infancy. Polishing the mirror every few weeks was expensive and damaged the curve of the instrument. The flat (the plane mirror used to reflect the focal plane) got in the way of incoming light, meaning that Newton's original demonstration had an effective aperture of under one inch. It was entirely useless for any form of astronomical observation.

                            <p>
                                Adding to the insult, the original Newtonian reflector quite simply was not a good telescope. It could have perhaps been used to a maximum magnification of about 40x with a 50 mm mirror, but nobody could create a mirror large enough to be used with a long enough focal length for higher magnifications. At this power, the image would lack contrast and be washed out, as the instrument would just not collect enough light. Newton's spherical mirror was indeed optically workable, but it would not scale up, since a sphere does not produce a single focal point for all incoming rays: spherical aberration applies to a spherical mirror (as well as any other ellipsoidal reflector/refractor). Newton had made a proof of concept, but many were questioning the very concept.

                            <p>
                                In short, Newton's obsession had solved chromatic aberration, but astronomers could live with that; he had not solved spherical aberration, which astronomers couldn't live with. Nor had he produced a workable telescope. While his device certainly worked, it could see no more than what Galileo could seventy years before and, due to spherical aberration, his device didn't scale up.

                                At the dawn of the eighteenth century, the refractor race was over. Uncertain economic times, the end of the Renaissance, and simple physics meant that the unlikely aerial telescopes had gotten as big as they were going to get; after 1692, very few aerial telescopes of the largest size were erected. But the smaller, wide-field, doubly convex telescopes were proliferating as their price dropped and lenses became more accurately ground. Reflectors were extremely difficult to make (and therefore expensive) and required near-constant maintenance.

                                The top-end, discovery-making telescopes stagnated, but a new type of telescope market had opened up. Compact field-lens telescopes based on the doubly convex Keplerian design had become small enough to be stored away in the home when not in use. The amateur astronomer had been born.

                                Newton's reflector was a worthless instrument and met a chilly reception. However, in the 1720s, Hadley had worked out that a huge aperture ratio (f-ratio)—that is, the ratio of the focal length to the aperture—would greatly reduce spherical aberration. Ratios such as f/10 to f/15 became the standard for Hadley's designs, and even modern reflectors rarely go under f/8. By 1730, reflectors with 150 mm mirrors had been made according to the aperture ratio rules. These performed up to 200x magnification and weren't as tall as a building.

                            <p>
                                By 1760 the final two pieces of the puzzle came when someone worked out how to grind a mirror to a parabola. Not only that, but optically sound ocular lenses with very short focal lengths came into use. Magnification is the ratio between the focal lengths of the primary and the ocular but, until then, the gains had always been made by making the primary longer. As William Herschel turned his parabolic reflector to the sky, he had 10 mm oculars available to him, and the short focal length meant he didn't need a hugely long focal on his primary mirror.

                                Large reflectors became the order of the day, largely split into two groups. Newtonian reflectors had a 45 degree flat, Cassegrain telescopes used curves on both mirrors, a parabolic primary and hyperbolic secondary (though originally spherical, elliptical, and primary-hyperbolic Cassegrain telescopes exist today). The Cassegrain telescope, however, was first experimented with a decade before Newton even thought of using a mirror; its big advantage is that it has a huge f-ratio and so monochromatic aberrations are minimal. The Cassegrains used at large observatories are made such that their aberration is below the diffraction limit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The 19th century saw the great minds of Maxwell, Abbe, and Gauss prove that a spherical reflector or refractor would unavoidably succumb to spherical aberration. &nbsp;But they also quantified other forms of monochromatic aberration, leading to the conclusion that absolutely no combination of lenses or mirrors could eliminate all monochromatic aberration. It should be noted that it was and is traditional for astronomers to use "monochromatic" and "spherical" interchangeably for all non-chromatic aberrations, even if the aberration isn't strictly spherical.

                                The first "modern" research telescopes were made in the late 19th century. These were both Cassegrain and Newtonian: They had a Newtonian focus and the holed mirror (hyperbolic usually) for a Cassegrain focus, so it was a simple matter of changing the secondaries. Modern research telescopes, such as Keck, continue this design.

                                Some, however, are purely Cassegrain and use two hyperbolic mirrors (called the Ritchey-Chrétien design) which limits spherical aberration to far below its own diffraction limit; other aberrations, such as coma, are negligible. The Hubble Space Telescope is a doubly hyperbolic Cassegrain.

                                The telescope story has come a long way from its beginnings with Italian glassworkers, but the basic principles were the same all the way through. Our giant space telescopes (including spy satellites that dwarf the Hubble in quality and price), down to the large optical interferometers with adaptive optics, then city-observatory telescopes of a meter or two aperture, then finally to the backyard amateur with a six-inch Newtonian. They all work the same way with the same rules.
