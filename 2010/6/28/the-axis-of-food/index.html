                                <a href="http://ficeda.com.mx/index.php">La Central de Abasto de la Ciudad de México</a> is enormous. It sprawls across a 327 hectare site on the eastern edge of the D.F., dwarfing fellow wholesale food markets such as <a href="http://www.huntspointcoopmkt.com/">Hunt’s Point</a> (24 hectares), <a href="http://www.tsukiji-market.or.jp/tukiji_e.htm">Tsukiji</a> (23 hectares), or even the massive <a href="http://www.rungisinternational.com/">Rungis</a>, outside Paris (232 hectares).

                                La Central has its own postcode, its own 700-member police force, and its own border-style entry gates, but during my visit, its enormity truly hit home only when we had to take a taxi to get from flowers to fish. It was a solid fifteen minute ride from one section of the market to another!

                                When the Central de Abasto was opened in 1982, approximately eighty percent of Mexico’s food supply passed through its 111 kilometres of passageways. In other words, an incredible four fifths of everything that every Mexican, from Cancun to Monterrey, ate every day passed through one single site in the nation’s capital. It was “one of Mexico’s last experiments in central economic planning,” as sociologist Gerardo Torres Salcido told <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-10-19-mexico-markets_N.htm"><em>USA Today</em></a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even today, between twenty and thirty percent of the country’s food is sold at La Central. According to <a href="http://davidlida.com/">David Lida</a> (whose enjoyable book about Mexico City, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594483787?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ediblgeogr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1594483787"><em>First Stop in the New World</em></a>, contains an entire chapter on food, and who I was lucky to see in conversation as <a href="http://www.negrophonic.com/2010/postopolis-df-june-8-12/">Jace Clayton’s guest</a> at <a href="http://postopolis.org/">Postopolis! DF</a>), “on a daily basis thirty thousand tons of food are trucked here from the rest of the country, and sold to three hundred thousand customers — mainly people who sell in smaller markets, to restaurants and food stands all over the city.”

                                    About $8 billion a year changes hands, mostly in cash; as such, merchandisers are prime prey to kidnappers. One vendor handed over half a million dollars to have his son released from captivity. He had that much money lying around at home; it was his float.

DF</a>, things were still pretty busy. For the most part, traffic consists of men (<em>cargadores</em>) pushing trolleys or pulling handcarts at a half-run, on which anything from two to twenty pallets of mangoes, crates of canteloupes, or boxes of oranges are stacked.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you are in their way (there is almost no way not to be), the <em>cargadores</em> whistle — and, by the end of our visit, I had started to notice that the pitch and phrasing of these whistles varies according to the navigational information it communicates. In other words, “Passing on your left!” sounds different from “Watch out, I’m about to cut you off.”
                            </p>
                            <p>

What’s more, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594483787?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ediblgeogr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1594483787">according to Lida</a>:

                                    The cargodores do not even earn a salary. Indeed, to rent their handcarts, they have to pay a little over a dollar a day to a character known as El Chino, a former street child and <em>cargador</em> himself. The workers vary between twelve and seventy years old. They charge between twenty and forty cents per box, depending on how heavy the load is and how far it has to be carried. An old man calculated that he earned about seven or eight dollars for a day’s work.

Many said fairly predictable things, like “Best Quality!” and “Lowest Price!” Others seemed to show a delightful sense of humour, such as the green beans “Without Cholesterol!” or the carrots “As Seen On TV!”

In both cases, the market had expanded beyond its central site, and was denigrated by city officials as cramped, dirty, and unsafe. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Merced_Market,_Mexico_City">La Merced</a> was (and still is) notorious for its <a href="http://todayspictures.slate.com/womeninmexico/">underage prostitutes;</a> Les Halles — Zola’s “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199555842?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ediblgeogr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0199555842">belly of Paris</a>” — was equally surrounded by rough-edged bars, restaurants, and brothels.

                                Cities with a centralised food distribution system traditionally kept markets close to the seat of government, recognising the power of food as a political tool. That proximity was intended to help kings and ministers maintain tight control over the urban populace through the supply of food, but as cities and the markets that fed them grew, the strategy backfired. As Carolyn Steel puts it, in her excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0099531682?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ediblgeogr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0099531682"><em>Hungry City</em></a>: “By concentrating all the city’s food in one place, they created a powerhouse strong enough to defy them.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By the 1970s, as Robert Moses rammed thirteen expressways through New York City, it seemed rational to authorities in Paris and Mexico City to start afresh, and move the messy business of food to spacious, orderly, hygienic, and purpose-built facilities at a safe distance outside town. La Central de Abasto’s <a href="http://www.ficeda.com.mx/editorial.php?idEditorial=1">stated mission</a> is to: “Be the axis of the country’s food supply system, in order to regulate the market and offer the consumer quality and price.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <img title="22 Lorries at Central de Abastos" src="http://www.ediblegeography.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/22-Lorries-at-Central-de-Abastos.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="321"> If the construction of La Central tells us a fascinating story about the evolution of governmental attempts to control food in order to tame cities, the market’s declining market share, down to handling between twenty and thirty percent of the nation’s food supply from eighty percent when it was first built, is testament to radical shifts in scale within the food business.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In other words, La Central was built to be the giant hub that tied together smallish farmers and merchants with smallish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianguis">tianguis</a> and restauranteurs. Food flowed through a single site that connected producers to vendors in a process that theoretically created greater efficiency and more competitive prices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <img title="43 Central de Abastos" src="http://www.ediblegeography.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/43-Central-de-Abastos.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="306"> But following on from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Free_Trade_Agreement">NAFTA</a> in the early 1990s, food producers and vendors have consolidated and expanded in scale, shrinking the role of the hub in the middle. Walmart has set up <a href="http://www.theworld.org/2010/04/22/mexicos-markets-going-mainstream/">its own supplier relationships and distribution networks</a>; <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/2009-04-25-swine-flu-smithfield/">Smithfield Factory Farms</a> is perfectly capable of finding customers without trucking its pigs all the way to a covered market on the outskirts of Mexico City.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although supply and demand no longer meet at one central market, Mexico’s food system has not decentralised — it has just centralised elsewhere along the chain.

It’s also easy to imagine the food safety issues, from terrorism to traceability, associated with concentrating eighty percent of the national food supply in a single site.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, the Central de Abasto system is not being replaced with a solution that makes those problems any less pressing.

                                Despite its transformation, La Central still preserves some of what made central markets such a vital part of the city: noise, rubbish, smells, and a heterotopic mixing of rich and poor, city and countryside. Overwhelmed by its size, chaos, and the sheer volume of food, a visitor can gain “an awareness of what it takes to sustain urban life,” to again quote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0099531682?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ediblgeogr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0099531682">Carolyn Steel</a>.
