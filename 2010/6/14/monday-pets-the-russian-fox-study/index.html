                            <p>
                                In 1948, Soviet scientist <a title="Dmitri Belyaev" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Belyaev">Dmitri Belyaev</a> lost his job at the Department of Fur Animal Breeding at the Central Research Laboratory of Fur Breeding in Moscow because of his commitment to classical genetics. At the time, in Soviet Russia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism">Lysenkoism</a> was all the rage (and by that, I mean, it was state doctrine). Lysenkoism (named for its champion Trofim Lysenko) is akin to Lamarckian inheritance - than acquired characteristics could be passed down to offspring. We now know, of course, that Lamarck was basically wrong and an organism's experiences can not be <strong>genetically</strong> passed to its offspring (though there may be <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/epigenetics.php">other mechanisms</a>).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our hero Belyaev was kicked out of the Fur Breeding Lab in Moscow, but he continued to study genetics under the guise of studying animal physiology throughout the 1950s. Then, in 1959, he became the director of the <a href="http://www.bionet.nsc.ru/indexEngl.html">Institute of Cytology and Genetics</a> of the Russian Academy of Sciences, in Novosibirsk, Russia. He remained director through 1985.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At the time, biologists were puzzled as to how dogs evolved to have different coats than wolves, since they couldn't figure out how the dogs could have inherited those genes from their ancestors. Belyaev saw silver foxes as a perfect opportunity to find out how this happened.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Belyaev believed that the key factor that was selected for was not morphological (physical attributes), but was behavioral. More specifically, he believed that tameness was the critical factor. How amenable was an animal to interacting with humans? This would certainly impact how well an animal would adapt to life with humans.
