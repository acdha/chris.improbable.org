                                Quick, out behind the bike shed, Professors Pendry and Leonhardt are having a fight over a completely hypothetical situation. If we hurry, we should catch the end of round three. Science: it is exactly like that <em>all the time</em>. It's just that, most of the time, the participants keep their disapproval of each other much more hidden.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So what am I talking about? The story takes place in an area of physics that has been long-neglected: friction. Everyone knows it exists, engineers have a bunch of empirical formulas to calculate it, but no one gave much thought to what actually causes friction. Physicists started to pay serious attention about 10 years ago and, since that time, a lot of heat seems to have been generated. There seems to be considerable disagreement between physicists at the moment, with each having their own pet theory, their own predictions, and absolutely nothing in the way of experimental data to back any of them up.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our protagonists are two theoretical physicists, one at Imperial College London and the other at St. Andrews in Scotland. The heart of their disagreement boils down to trying to decide what happens in a seemingly simple situation. Imagine two perfectly smooth plates of material at a temperature of absolute zero, sitting in a perfect vacuum. The plates are separated from each other by a small distance and one is moving past the other at a constant rate. The big question: do these plates experience friction?
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Finding friction
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                If you were somewhat naive, you would say, "no, of course not; they are not touching, so there can be no friction." Indeed this is what an engineer's formulas would tell you.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But it is not so simple, for two reasons. First of all, materials are made up of charges, and the movement of their electrons means that, at any given moment of time, parts of the two surfaces will have net positive or negative charges. What's more, the only stable configuration is for oppositely charged areas to sit directly across from each other. The weak attractions that result are called van der Waal's forces—they are real, and, yes, they cause friction. This is the part that most people agree on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The plates are moving relative to each other, meaning that the mirroring of charged regions described above has a time-lag to it—the oppositely charged areas won't be aligned exactly opposite to each other. This causes friction, because the force of attraction is not only pulling the plates towards each other, but also opposing their motion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But life is never simple. The plates are at absolute zero, which raises the question of whether the charges rearrange themselves. The answer, according to a 2009 <em><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/11/3/033035">New Journal of Physics</a></em> article by Philbin and Leonhardt, is no. They discuss the vacuum fluctuations in the space between the plates in terms of the fields&nbsp;they generate&nbsp;(light waves, really) and the resulting forces upon the plates. When classical electrodynamics is used to calculate the forces, the authors find that, although the plates are attracted to each other, the forces don't act to slow the motion.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                No friction at all. And the solution is exact, so it must be right.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Producing intellectual friction
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                This obviously aroused a bit of suspicion, because Pendry wrote a response to the same journal earlier this year, entitled "<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/12/3/033028">Quantum friction—fact or fiction</a>." In this paper, which on occasion drips with sarcastic malice, Pendry focuses on the charges and their behavior.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He comes up with a quantum mechanical description of the charge motion in which it's viewed in terms of the annihilation and creation of surface plasmons. Again, the description to this point is exact, but, in order to get the frictional force, Pendry has to assume that it is just a small perturbation to the zero-force solution. Given that assumption, the result is that, yes there is a frictional force, and his description of it agrees with other, non-quantum descriptions. Pendry must be right, because of quantum mechanics.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, why do these results disagree with the earlier ones? Pendry took a look at that as well. Apparently Philbin and Leonhardt had forgotten to take into account the effect of the Doppler shift in their calculations.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Philbin and Leonhardt use fields and waves to calculate forces and, at every interface, part of the wave is reflected exactly like light from a glass surface. However, the plates are moving with respect to each other, meaning that the wavelength changes due to the Doppler shift. This changes the balance of forces and friction returns.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                End of story, right? Wrong.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Physics done in anger
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Leonhardt was obviously pretty ticked off at Pendry, because he penned a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/12/6/068001">poisonous reply</a>. In his comment on Pendry's article,&nbsp;Leonhardt&nbsp;takes issue with the title, the perceived claim of an exact solution, and, finally, the physics.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Leonhardt argues that the&nbsp;title is inappropriate, because experimental evidence is the ultimate arbiter, and no one has any. A good jab, but hardly damaging. He then takes issue with Pendry's solution. It's not exact, and therefore can't be right—nevermind that Pendry's approach is widely used and we have a good sense of when it doesn't work. Finally, the physics. According to Leonhardt, Pendry has made a mistake.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here's the tricky part. In a static situation, electric fields are electric fields, magnetic fields are magnetic fields, and the two are quite separate. In motion, this changes. Electric fields acquire a magnetic component, while magnetic fields acquire an electric component.&nbsp;Since our two plates—remember the plates? this is all about the plates!—are moving, the fields have both an electrical and a magnetic nature. Furthermore, Leonhardt argues, not taking this into account leads directly to the wrong, too frictional, answer.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In fact, he claims that, if Pendry's solution is to be taken seriously, one can extract infinite amounts of energy simply by making one plate really massive so that the frictional force causes the other, lighter plate, to accelerate to match its velocity. If one then replaces the lighter plate with a train of such plates, endless energy results. It's a perpetual motion machine smackdown.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Pendry has, of course, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/12/6/068002">responded</a>. First, he shows that, for his description of friction, the magnetic contribution to the total force is very small, and that its contribution to the frictional component of the force is exactly zero. Pendry also acknowledges that the frictional model he proposed was incomplete and, that yes, if it were the whole story, you could extract infinite energy from it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The point of his model was twofold, he argues. First, its simple surface plasmon description only allows for frictional forces or zero forces. That is, you can't make an anti-frictional surface from them. Therefore, if you can show that these have frictional forces, then it is quite likely that they are, indeed, there—though not in the precise form that Pendry describes them.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The more important point was to use the model to bring Leonhardt's work into agreement with the rest of the literature on the subject. This has been achieved, he claims, by including the Doppler shift in Leonhardt's original work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What's next? I suspect there will be the odd tense moment the next time these two meet at a conference. If I had to guess, I would say that Pendry's view will win out in the end, but the real point is that this sort of aggressive argumentation is what real science is like. It's just that usually the protagonists hide it a lot better.
