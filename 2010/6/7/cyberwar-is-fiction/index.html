                        <blockquote>
                            <div style="clear:both;text-align:center">
                                <a href="http://www.china-defense-mashup.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/challenger3.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://www.china-defense-mashup.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/challenger3.jpg" width="320"></a>
                            </div>I'm reading various articles about the Russia's proposal, with support from the UN, for a "<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703340904575284964215965730.html">cyberwarfare arms limitation</a> <a href="http://volokh.com/2010/06/06/going-wobbly-on-russias-cybersecurity-disarmament-proposal/">treaty</a>". What astounds me is that nobody seems to realize that "cyberwarfare" is a fictional story, and that "arms" in cyberspace don't exist.<br>
                            <br>
                            "Cyberwar" and "cyberweapons" are fiction. The conflicts between nation states in cyberspace are nothing like warfare, and the tools hackers use are nothing like weapons. Putting "cyber" in front a something is just way for people to grasp technical concepts, the analogies quickly break down, and are useless when taken too far (such as a "cyber disarmament treaty"). Unfortunately, it's the clueless people who believe in these analogies that are driving national policy.<br>
                            <a name="more" id="more"></a><br>
                            <div style="clear:both;text-align:center">
                                <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TJ2XNCjin0s/TAy8Diya46I/AAAAAAAAAO8/YqHkPjh3o9s/s1600/iphone_home.gif" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_TJ2XNCjin0s/TAy8Diya46I/AAAAAAAAAO8/YqHkPjh3o9s/s200/iphone_home.gif" width="121"></a>
                            </div>I can disable the national power grids of half the countries in the world using nothing more than an iPhone. There is no such thing as "cyberweapons". Sure, there are tools that make this easier, but it's the person using the tools, and not the tools themselves, that are important.<br>
                            <br>
                            What makes special forces (like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Army_Special_Forces">Green Berets</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_seals">Navy Seals</a>) so much better than the average soldier? Is it better weapons? No, it's better training. These guys are trained to kill you with their hands, or with a knife, or with anything that's available. The same is true with hackers: all we need is some crappy computer and a network connection, and we can hack into <i>anything</i>. (During a "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test">pen-test</a>", I've had my finger on the "off" switch for an entire country's power grid from a mobile phone).<br>
                            <br>
                            Hacking is very technical, so we use analogies to explain how it works. The thing to remember is that <i>these are just analogies</i>. Any conclusions you might draw from the analogies could be wrong.<br>
                            <br>
                            <div style="clear:both;text-align:center">
                                <a href="http://westcentralcommunityeducation.com/images/catapult%20and%20castle.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"><img border="0" height="238" src="http://westcentralcommunityeducation.com/images/catapult%20and%20castle.jpg" width="320"></a>
                            </div>For example, let's say that you want to attack a castle. You use catapults to hurl rocks at the walls, but the walls are too strong. So, you get bigger catapults to hurl bigger rocks.<br>
                            <br>
                            But then somebody comes to you with a better idea. He has a trained dog that can sniff out secret tunnels. You send the dog out, he finds a tunnel, your soldiers sneak in, and take control of the castle.<br>
                            <br>
                            So, the next time you attack a castle, you send the dog out to find tunnels. However, the dog comes back without finding anything. Therefore, you conclude, <i>you need a bigger dog</i>. The "dog" is analogous to a "catapult", and if a bigger catapult does its job better, so must a bigger dog. (I'm assuming at this point the reader understands the foolishness of this analogy, and that the size of the dog is irrelevant).<br>
                            <br>
                            The same is true of "cyberweapons", an analogy used to describe tools like "exploits". An "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)">exploit</a>" is a program that you aim at another computer in order to take control of it. Most people in our military think that if an exploit doesn't work against a well-defended computer, then you need a more "powerful" exploit. This is wrong, in exactly that same way that a "bigger dog" won't help. (Like finding secret tunnels to sneak into castles, hackers find programming bugs, then exploit them to sneak into computers).<br>
                            <br>
                            This is why the military will never understand cyberspace. Their idea of attack and defense is based on the idea of "brute force": just throw more resources at it, such as bigger bombs, more soldiers, higher tech airplanes. Defeating enemies in cyberspace is different, means outsmarting them, and the military doesn't do smart.<br>
                            <br>
                            Moreover, the military is very goal driven. They want weapons that have a specific effect. That's not how hacking works. Hacking is opportunistic. For example, let's say that you want to attack Iran. You might give your cyberwarriors the task of taking out their radar. That's not something the cyberwarriors could do: chances are good that the exploits they have will have no effect on Iranian radar computers.<br>
                            <br>
                            <div style="clear:both;text-align:center">
                                <a href="http://faculty.unlv.edu/pwerth/Map-Iran-1982.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://faculty.unlv.edu/pwerth/Map-Iran-1982.jpg" width="198"></a>
                            </div>Instead, the correct thing would be to assign your cyberwarriors the task of doing anything they can, attack any Iranian computers vulnerable to the exploits they have. It's hard to predict what the outcome would be: maybe a crash of their financial markets, disruption of their military communications, or massive blackouts.<br>
                            <br>
                            This is why a nation's army will not be involved in a true "cyberwar": hacking just doesn't fit into the military model.<br>
                            <br>
                            It's also why China and Russia are winning a cybewar against the United States: because it's not their armies conducting the war.<br>
                            <br>
                            Totalitarian governments, like China, Russia, or Iran, need dirty work done, but without getting caught. They need "plausible deniability". Unfortunately, this is essentially impossible: you really can't have big conspiracies without leaking information.<br>
                            <br>
                            <div style="clear:both;text-align:center">
                                <a href="http://thedecliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/nashi.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://thedecliner.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/nashi.jpg" width="320"></a>
                            </div>To fix this, these governments sponsor nationalistic youth groups, like the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashi_%28youth_movement%29">Nashi</a>" in Russia, or the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basij">Basij</a>" in Iran. These groups are sympathetic to the government, but not technically under control of the government. These groups love their national government, and tend to do things that government would want, without being told.<br>
                            <br>
                            Thus, when journalists in Russia says something critical of the government, they are beaten up (or murdered) by the Nashi. The government never tells the Nashi to beat anybody up - it just happens. At most, the government will instruct police not to investigate the crimes too heavily. As a result, Russia is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists, but without a national policy to kill journalists.<br>
                            <br>
                            The problem with these youth groups is that since they aren't being controlled by the central government, they don't always get the right results. Sometimes the wrong people are killed, or the right journalists are ignored. It's the price the government has to pay in order to keep its hands clean.<br>
                            <br>
                            <div style="clear:both;text-align:center">
                                <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/04/27/world/estonia.lede.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"><img border="0" height="171" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/04/27/world/estonia.lede.jpg" width="320"></a>
                            </div>This is what happened in the "cyberattacks" against Estonia and Georgia. The attacks were carried out by nationalistic hackers working independently from the main government. The government doesn't tell these hackers what to do; they just know that in any conflict, nationalistic youths will hack their enemy. The price Russia pays for this, though, is a lot of cybercrime within the country. (Russian hackers aren't just a problem here in America, they cause a lot of problems within Russia as well).<br>
                            <br>
                            <div style="clear:both;text-align:center">
                                <a href="http://cache1.asset-cache.net/xc/78365435.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=9E7D312EDC8D63D00B86EFCDA0F1517FB87425A4017545C339D1DBA656B96C3DE30A760B0D811297" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"><img border="0" height="150" src="http://cache1.asset-cache.net/xc/78365435.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=9E7D312EDC8D63D00B86EFCDA0F1517FB87425A4017545C339D1DBA656B96C3DE30A760B0D811297" width="200"></a>
                            </div>Our own military and intelligence organizations do not believe in this. They can only believe in conspiracies run by government - they cannot deal with the fact that the attacks coming from China and Russia are not being directed by those governments. But both Russia and China understand this. This is why Russia is pushing for a "cyberspace disarmament treaty". It would only hindered American military and intelligence services, but wouldn't affect nationalistic youth groups. American has no nationalistic youth groups. Indeed, in America, such youths are more concerned about attacking our own government and corporations ("fighting the Man") than they are about fighting foreign adversaries.<br>
                            <br>
                            The basic truth in cybersecurity is that you don't have to build products/services that outwit hackers, you only have to outwit your customers. As long as you know a tiny bit more about hacking than your customers, they will buy anything from you. I'm seeing that a lot lately, such as the recent case of <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/04/booz-allen/">Booz and Allen hyping fictional stories</a> about the <a href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2009/11/brazil-outage-not-caused-by-hackers.html">power grid</a> in order to secure a $34-million contract from the government. Another example is the <a href="http://csis.org/">"Center for Strategic and International Studies"</a> (CSIS). It's a lobbying organization that produced a <a href="http://csis.org/program/commission-cybersecurity-44th-presidency">document</a> that has become a blueprint for cybersecurity regulation that threatens our liberties in cyberspace. This sort of cluelessness is a bigger danger to cyberspace than Russian hackers.<br>
                            <br>
                            <div style="clear:both;text-align:center">
                                <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Keith_B._Alexander_official_portrait.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Keith_B._Alexander_official_portrait.jpg" width="160"></a>
                            </div>The military has set up a "cyber command" to coordinate all offensive/defensive operations in cyberspace. Its commander, General Keith Alexander, gave a <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/speeches_testimonies/100603_alexander_transcript.pdf">speech</a> at CSIS recently. I don't know what to make of it. On one hand, he said things that demonstrate cluelessness, but on the other hand, he said things that demonstrate competence with the subject. Generals tend to be geniuses, so I would be a fool to assume Gen. Alexander is clueless, so I'll have to assume he was simplifying things for a clueless audience. I'm worried nonetheless.<br>
                            <br>
                            So, to summarize, the idea of nation states waging cyberwar with powerful cyberweapons is utter fiction. It's an analogy we might use to describe some things, but it's not what really goes on in cyberspace. <b>The conflicts between nation states in cyberspace are nothing like warfare, and the tools hackers use are nothing like weapons.</b> However, this fiction is what is driving national policy, and that worries me a lot. I feel this cluelessness is a bigger danger to cyberspace than foreign hackers.<br>
                            <br>
                            UPDATE: I just thought of another way to describe this: <b>The military tries to make cyber fit within normal military practices, rather than changing military practices to fit in cyberspace.</b><br>
