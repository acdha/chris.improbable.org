                                Of the three mobile network operators in the Netherlands, only T-Mobile sells the iPhone. And only T-Mobile has a large part of its customer base irate from lack of 3G data access, dropped calls, and calls going directly to voicemail even with full 3G coverage.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So no, such problems aren't limited just to AT&amp;T. And as with AT&amp;T, the problems are worst in the largest and most tech-savvy cities. Those problems are now so bad that T-Mobile is offering a little cashback for affected users.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                3G problems
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                iPhone users have complained about T-Mobile's data performance for some time, but recently the problem seems to have spun out of control. Not only is 3G data service slow, but voice service is also suffering in certain locations on 3G phones—not just the iPhone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Turning off 3G magically makes the voice problems disappear, but it doesn't really help with the data slowness because T-Mobile doesn't have EDGE 2.75G service. Instead, it has GPRS, which can just about manage to beat 56Kbps dial-up on a good day.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Earlier, T-Mobile said it was working on the congestion in its 3G network by adding new base stations, something that would take until the end of the year. However, now the problems are supposed to be mostly fixed in "one or two weeks" by doubling the capacity of existing base stations in affected locations, though the longer-term plan to increase the number of base stations continues.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the meantime, Dutch T-Mobile users who document their issues on the "<a href="http://www.t-mobile.nl/persoonlijk/htdocs/page/service-contact/dekkingsvragen.aspx">coverage questions</a>" page on the carrier's website can expect a refund of two months' worth of data usage. However, the iPhone plans, which start at €30 per month, don't explicitly list data charges. Reportedly, the cashback will amount to €30 for iPhone users. It's also unclear what happens to 3G users who don't have a data plan.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ironically, T-Mobile almost got fined for leaving 3G frequencies unused late last year. There are currently three mobile network operators in the Netherlands: KPN, Vodafone, and T-Mobile. There used to be five, but KPN took over Telfort and T-Mobile picked up Orange. After those deals, KPN and T-Mobile left Telfort's and Orange's 3G frequencies unused, contrary to the obligations set out by the government. KPN chose to return Telfort's 3G frequencies to the government, but T-Mobile put Orange's into token use in order to hang on to them while escaping fines. Quite likely, the current efforts to double the 3G capacity in congested locations make use of these frequencies, although no spokesperson would ever dream of boring the public with such details.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The question is, how long will the new and improved T-Mobile 3G network last? Dutch Railways is rolling out free WiFi access in its intercity trains, using T-Mobile's 3G network for backhaul. That's a potential audience of 150,000 free WiFi users by the end of the year. And the Dutch just love using anything that's free to its fullest. (Belgians joke that copper wire was invented by two people who spotted a penny on an Amsterdam street at the same time.)

                                The iPad will soon arrive in the low country, along with a newer iPhone with new data-intensive features such as video chat. For a while now, the mobile industry has been struggling with increased data use by smartphone users, but with "unlimited" plans the increase in use doesn't lead to an increase in revenue, so expensive network upgrades directly impact the bottom line (and not in a good way). In this light, AT&amp;T's move <a href="http://arstechnica.com/telecom/news/2010/06/new-att-data-plans-milk-data-gluttons-lower-costs-for-most.ars">away from unlimited mobile data</a> makes a lot of sense. Then again, users <em>hate</em> volume-based pricing for Internet access.
