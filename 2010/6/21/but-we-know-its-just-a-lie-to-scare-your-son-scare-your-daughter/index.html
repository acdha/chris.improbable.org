                                    Paul Krugman provides a <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/zombies-have-already-killed-the-deficit-commission/">concise take-down</a> of the "ZOMG! Social Security is going bankrupt!!!" canard, and indirectly makes the argument that maybe Social Security/the federal government would be a little more solvent if the establishment media had spent less time snickering about the fact that Al Gore said "lockbox" several times, and more time wondering whether or not "would rather have a beer with" was the right criteria with which to choose the next President.

                                        Specifically, Simpson has resurrected the old nonsense about how Social Security will be bankrupt as soon as payroll tax revenues fall short of benefit payments, never mind the quarter century of surpluses that came first.
                                    </p>

                                        We went through all this at length back in 2005, but let me do this yet again.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Social Security is a government program funded by a dedicated tax. There are two ways to look at this. First, you can simply view the program as part of the general federal budget, with the the dedicated tax bit just a formality. And there’s a lot to be said for that point of view; if you take it, benefits are a federal cost, payroll taxes a source of revenue, and they don’t really have anything to do with each other.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Alternatively, you can look at Social Security on its own. And as a practical matter, this has considerable significance too; as long as Social Security still has funds in its trust fund, it doesn’t need new legislation to keep paying promised benefits.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        OK, so two views, both of some use. But here’s what you can’t do: you can’t have it both ways. You can’t say that for the last 25 years, when Social Security ran surpluses, well, that didn’t mean anything, because it’s just part of the federal government — but when payroll taxes fall short of benefits, even though there’s lots of money in the trust fund, Social Security is broke.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And bear in mind what happens when payroll receipts fall short of benefits: NOTHING. No new action is required; the checks just keep going out.
                                    </p>

                                    Right.  When there's a Social Security surplus, the money gets eaten by general expenditures and, in the case of Bush, massive tax cuts aimed primarily at the uber wealthy.  But if there's a prospect of a Social Security deficit, eventually, we can't possibly buttress the Social Security pool with general revenue (perhaps even boost said revenue by repealing some of those deficit busting tax cuts*).  No, it's time to cut benefits and extend the retirement age to 70.
