                            <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/06/2002-megaflood-carved-22km-canyon-in-three-days.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss"><img vspace="4" hspace="4" border="0" align="right" width="230" height="129" src="http://static.arstechnica.com/assets/2010/06/canyon_lake_flood-thumb-230x130-14873-f.jpg"></a>
                            <p>
                                Most of the dramatic features of river basins—canyons, gorges, and so on—formed through rather mundane processes, primarily the slow erosion caused by a constant flow of water and seasonal floods. But researchers have also identified a few cases, both on Earth and Mars, where features seem to have been formed by sudden massive flooding (on Earth, these are often associated with <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/04/draining-glacial-lakes-causes-a-big-chill.ars">glacial melting</a>). We have geological evidence of these catastrophic events, and models that reproduce their behavior but, because they're extremely rare, it has been impossible to test how well these models do when compared to a real event. Scientists have now identified a Texas flood that carved a seven meter deep canyon in 2002 that presents just such a rare opportunity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The flood occurred in 2002 at a site now called Canyon Lake Gorge. The site resides just below an emergency spillway, meant to relieve pressure on a dam across the Guadalupe River. During the summer of 2002, the river basin received nearly three feet of rain over the course of about a week. It was the first time the spillway became active, and the landscape below it would literally not be the same afterwards.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Over the course of just a few days, the flood barreled through limestone-rich bedrock, carving out 1.2km of canyon with an average depth of over seven meters, and as deep as 12m in some spots. Below that region, the gorge opens up into another kilometer that's a bit more like an alluvial valley, with winding channels spread over a wider space.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The key opportunity here is that we have before-and-after photos and surveying data, pictures of the event, and even fairly accurate measures of the amount of water that raced down the channel. Flows seem to have peaked at nearly 1,500 cubic meters of water every second.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By examining the features of the canyon, along with the boulders that were carved out of it, the authors conclude that most of the action didn't actually involve erosion. Many fine details of the rocks on the canyon walls, including fossilized patterns of water that flowed when the rock first formed, remain intact, suggesting the bedrock itself wasn't worn down. The boulders that were removed to form the canyon were typically about a meter in diameter, but tended to be comprised of a single, flat sheet of rock.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The authors conclude that most of rock was removed from the canyon by a process called "plucking," in which pressure and shear forces lift large sheets of rock off at once.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They then turn to various models that have been used to evaluate potential megafloods that occurred in the distant past. For the most part, various models are all in the right neighborhood when it comes to water volumes, although they tend to bracket the average flow, and underestimate the sharp peak that occurred in this particular case. They also do a decent job estimating the stress and particle motion within the flood itself, figures that can be used to reconstruct the duration of the event. They come up with a window between a half day and three weeks—the major portion of the flood occurred over about three days.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, overall, if we know we're dealing with a megaflood, the models we have seem to do a pretty good job. The problem, apparently, is knowing that a megaflood was involved in the first place. "It is difficult to identify morphologic features in Canyon Lake Gorge that indicate canyon formation during a three day event, versus a longer-lived flood or multiple events," the authors note.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even with that residual uncertainty, however, the chance to validate our models against a well-defined event should give us greater confidence in their applications elsewhere.
