                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Along with other members of the local specialty coffee community, I recently had a chance to sit down with representatives of the Ethiopian government to discuss problems with the import of beans from that country.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A little background: over the past few years, the Ethiopian government has implemented new rules meant to ensure that coffee farmers received payments for their coffee in a timely and consistent fashion. This was in part a response to reports that small farmers were not receiving promised payments from exporters and in part due to a concern that the government itself was getting shortchanged by deals being cut in the private market. As a result, the government required all coffee to be sold through an existing national commodities exchange with the idea that it would provide a level playing field between farmers and exporters. However, this had several unintended consequences. While cooperatives were still allowed to export their own coffee lots, private mills (processing facilities that take in raw coffee cherries and turn out green coffee ready for export) were shut down by the regulation changes. Effectively, all coffee growers who weren’t a member of a coop were forced to send their coffee through centralized government-owned mills. Unfortunately these facilities did not have the capacity to process the quantities of coffee they were suddenly facing in a timely manner, which has lead to delays of weeks to months between when buyers pay for their coffee and when the coffee could be shipped out of the country. The mills also were not set up to separate out small lots of coffee so that beans were being pooled, lowering the overall quality of available exports.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Part of the problem was that the government grossly underestimated the portion of the market made up by specialty coffee (as compared with the bulk of the market comprised by large-scale commercial roasters that produce the junk coffee that is sold in tin cans, pregound or freeze dried, and goes into flavored coffee products such as nescafe or McCafe’s). The changes mainly impacted the specialty market which as a result bought less Ethiopian coffee last year. This resulted in a large drop in general revenues generated by green coffee sales. As it turns out, specialty coffee buyers, in fact, make up a substantial chunk of coffee purchases. We pay much, much higher prices per pound of coffee than large commercial roasters. So although specialty coffee is a relatively small part of the market, it makes up a disproportionate share of revenues.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a consequence, Ethiopian coffee has begun to lose market share as specialty coffee roasters have started looking elsewhere for beans that could replace the quality of coffee they had been getting from the origin. This may also lead to Ethiopian coffee losing some of its prestige which makes it more attractive even to large-scale roasters. In Ethiopia, this has caused some coffee farmers to cut down coffee plants in favor of crops that they can reliably sell.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The significance of this cannot be understated. Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee and is home to many heritage varietals as well as some of the oldest coffee plants in the world. Coffee is also a crop that requires long-term stability to thrive. All of these factors have raised concern within the specialty coffee community (and increasing worry within the Ethiopian government) that Ethiopian coffee will be marginalized.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, the problem they now face is bigger than just reestablishing these interrupted lines of trade. They must also rebuild the trust of the specialty coffee community, which had spent decades developing direct relationships with growers, much of which disappeared over night. Those in attendance at this week’s meeting offered suggestions and recommendations. The government has strong financial incentives to take heed, but whether they can move rapidly enough to staunch the loss of market share remains very much an open question.
