                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <em>The New York Times</em> this morning took the Administration <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/us/politics/25caribou.html?ref=politics">to task</a> because White House officials and lobbyists are meeting at a local coffee shop, undermining the White House transparency rules for meetings between its officials and lobbyists. We’re not naive and didn’t expect that releasing the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/WhiteHouseVisitors/">Visitor Logs</a> would capture all meetings between lobbyists and White House officials. I’ve been a Washington denizen for too many years to believe that we’d have total transparency of a very protected relationship.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the story gives me an opportunity to think about a nagging and ongoing concern: are we being lulled by the rhetoric of transparency?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have believed — and still want to believe –  that the Administration is sincere in <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/about">their efforts</a>. It’s not a stretch – but maybe not much of an accomplishment either – to call this the most transparent Administration in (recent) history. No other Administration has even talked their talk, much less tried to walk their walk.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But where there’s a will to hide something, there’s always a way. What concerns me now is whether all the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Transparency_and_Open_Government/">White House promises</a> are anything more than “transparency theater.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the one hand, there have been significant pronouncements about<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/Update-on-Recovery-Act-Lobbying-Rules-New-Limits-on-special-Interest-Influence/">transparency for lobbyist activity</a>, and about the need for open information and data. The Administration, from the first full day in office, has made this at least a rhetorical priority. “Good start” we’ve said for some 18 months. And the early signs were promising.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But  the delivery of the rhetoric has been deeply disappointing. The torrent of data <a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/04/08/open-government-idling-in-the-driveway/">we expected to see</a> at Data.gov i<a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/04/08/agency-compliance-with-data-requirement-mixed/">sn’t materializing</a>. In fact, <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/people/lmontanez/">Luigi</a> in Sunlight Labs quickly calculated that literally only 1 percent of Data.gov is useful if you want to do something other than build a map. (That is, 99 percent of the 272,677 data listings are GIS data — shapefiles that are only useful for mapping software and similar tools.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://usaspending.gov/">USASpending,gov</a> data is riddled with so many errors that it is practically useless. <a href="http://recovery.gov">Recovery.gov</a> has been consistently rushed and is having a hard time finding the right balance between flashy presentation and substantive data. And the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/around">Open Government Directive</a> delivered very little data and offered few substantive plans for either agency audits or release of it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Call it a hot Friday afternoon, and maybe I’m cranky, but I think it’s time to begin to ask some tough questions of the White House. Whither or wither transparency?
                            </p>
