                                    Well, can't say I didn't <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2008/08/i-value-them-bu.html">warn ya</a>.  <a href="http://progressiverealist.org/blogpost/american-interference-somalia-blowback-101">Adam Serwer</a>:
                                </p>

                                        Two New Jersey men, Mohamed Mahmood Alessa and Carlos Eduardo Almonte, were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/nyregion/07terror.html">arrested</a> at JFK airport yesterday on suspicion of trying to join Al-Shabaab, the Somali terrorist group that has been affiliated with al-Qaeda. I've <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=11&amp;year=2009&amp;base_name=2006_invasion_of_somalia_looki">written</a> about this before, but in light of the arrests, it's worth pointing out again that this group -- which has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/24/us/24terror.html">recruited</a> more Americans than any other al-Qaeda allied organization, including the first American suicide bomber -- would not have existed in its current form were it not for the Bush-backed Ethiopian invasion of Somalia in 2006.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Bush administration intervened because it wanted to depose the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), which ruled harshly but provided stability and had some relatively moderate elements. The invasion empowered the hardliners, and a former ICU leader who was later elected president and <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2009/04/200941895049381692.html">imposed</a> Sharia law anyway. The ongoing civil war between Islamic radicals and the unstable government has drawn hundreds of terror recruits from around the world. This whole situation is a lesson in the unintended consequences of military intervention.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As the situation in Somalia shows, discrediting al-Qaeda and its allies and drying up their recruiting pool cannot be achieved through military means alone. Having attempted to do so in Somalia in 2006, the U.S. helped empower a terrorist organization that has shown an uncanny ability to recruit Americans -- even for high-profile <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/magazine/31Jihadist-t.html?pagewanted=all">leadership</a> positions.

                                    Who could have known that backing Somalia's long time and bitter regional rival, Ethiopia, in its "magnanimous" invasion of that country would result in further instability (a long time stated goal of Ethiopia), increased violence, increased radicalization, increased anti-Americanism, increased humanitarian crises and the empowerment of more extreme elements - Now with 100% more blowback?
