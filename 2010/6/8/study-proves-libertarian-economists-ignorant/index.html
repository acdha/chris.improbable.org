                                Conservatives are very excited about a new study by George Mason economist Daniel Klein purporting to show that conservatives and libertarians understand economics far better than liberals do. Here's Klein's <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703561604575282190930932412.html?mod=WSJ_Opinion_LEADTop">op-ed</a> in today's <em>Wall Street Journal</em>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Who is better informed about the policy choices facing the country—liberals, conservatives or libertarians? According to a Zogby International survey that I write about in the May issue of Econ Journal Watch, the answer is unequivocal: The left flunks Econ 101.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Zogby researcher Zeljka Buturovic and I considered the 4,835 respondents' (all American adults) answers to eight survey questions about basic economics. We also asked the respondents about their political leanings: progressive/very liberal; liberal; moderate; conservative; very conservative; and libertarian.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Rather than focusing on whether respondents answered a question correctly, we instead looked at whether they answered incorrectly. A response was counted as incorrect only if it was flatly unenlightened.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>

                                If you look at the questions, though, they turn out not to gauge so much economic knowledge as agreement with the neoclassical economic model. Klein lists his questions:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    1) Mandatory licensing of professional services increases the prices of those services (unenlightened answer: disagree). 2) Overall, the standard of living is higher today than it was 30 years ago (unenlightened answer: disagree). 3) Rent control leads to housing shortages (unenlightened answer: disagree). 4) A company with the largest market share is a monopoly (unenlightened answer: agree). 5) Third World workers working for American companies overseas are being exploited (unenlightened answer: agree). 6) Free trade leads to unemployment (unenlightened answer: agree). 7) Minimum wage laws raise unemployment (unenlightened answer: disagree)
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Note that all these questions measure not economic knowledge per se but <em>agreement with the neoclassical model</em>. There are no questions about, say, whether tax cuts at current levels tend to increase or decrease tax revenues. This was a test obviously designed to portray conservatives as better informed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Conservatism and libertarianism believe that the neoclassical model of self-correcting markets and perfectly rational behavior perfectly, or almost perfectly, whereas liberals tend to believe that the model falls short in all sorts of ways. (See: Economic Collapse, 2007.) Klein's method consists of asking respondents whether they essentially accept his model. Klein treats anybody who thinks a Third World worker for an overseas American firm is being exploited as ignorant of economics, when this is obviously a questions of values rather than knowledge. The minimum wage question is even worse. It counts anybody who doubts that minimum wage laws always raise unemployment as ignorant, when in fact <a href="http://www.krueger.princeton.edu/90051397.pdf">empirical evidence</a> suggests that in practice the link may be nonexistent.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The only thing this study demonstrates is the ideological hackery of its authors.
