                        <blockquote>
                            <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_78ZrJuZ3q5g/TCBqBZlquRI/AAAAAAAAC5c/3_It6a5Kq4E/s1600/elephant20shit1.jpg"><img style="margin:0pt 10px 10px 0pt;float:left;width:320px;height:183px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_78ZrJuZ3q5g/TCBqBZlquRI/AAAAAAAAC5c/3_It6a5Kq4E/s320/elephant20shit1.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>I read the current issue of Reason magazine today, where Brink Lindsay, from the Cato Institute, makes the case for why libertarians shouldn't ally themselves with the Right. I agree whole <span>heartily</span>. He pointed to the bigoted Tea Party types as one example of why this strategy is bad for libertarians. Matt Kibble tried to pretend that Brink's view is merely based on "liberal" media distortions. Sorry Matt, it is precisely the sort of rampant bigotry that I personally witnessed at one of the largest Tea Party rallies in recent months.<br>
                            <br>
                            The other day I was invited to speak to a small group of people. The host was a friend, who was at the Tea Party rally as well. He made a point of telling me how disgusted he was with what he witnessed there. His observations were the same as my own, as were two other libertarian friends at the same meeting. All four of agreed that the Tea Party is not for libertarians.<br>
                            <br>
                            And neither are Republicans. Consider this tidbit from the <span>Theopublican</span> Party of Texas, in their 2010 platform. They claim to believe that "Realizing that conflict and debate is a proven learning tool in classrooms, we support objective teaching and equal treatment of all sides of scientific theories, including, evolution, Intelligent Design...." Intelligent Design is theology not science. But that aside, do the Republicans of Texas really believe in debate and equal treatment of all sides? The same platform says: "We oppose any sex education other than abstinence until heterosexual marriage."<br>
                            <br>
                            So they want open debate when theology pretends to be science, but demand closing all debate and conflict as a "proven learning tool" when it regards sex. They are the typical conservative frauds, the typical conservative hypocrites. They only want open debate for their side until they control an agenda and they want to stifle debate and discussion entirely.<br>
                            <br>
                            They claim to believe in, "the <span>sanctity</span> of human life, created in the image of God, which should be protected from fertilization until natural death." So, all human life is sacred and must be protected until natural death? Well, no. "Properly applied capital punishment is legitimate, is an effective deterrent, and should be <span>swift</span> and unencumbered." Hell, why even bother with a <span>trial</span>? Clearly not "all human life is sacred" and some lives must be ended unnaturally by execution though all life must be protected "until natural death." Of course, they are Republicans. They see it completely natural for governments to kill people.<br>
                            <br>
                            As for sex offenders, well, they want to turn a large percentage of teens into criminals. First, they demand that an "'affirmative defense' when there is less than 36 months of age difference" be abolished. That way all teens who have consenting sex with one another are deemed sex offenders if they are the same age. Second, they demand that age of consent in Texas be raised to 18, so that even more kids will be classified as sex offenders. And they claim to be pro-family. It's enough to make one vomit. This is under they "sexual <span>assault</span>" section and the first thing there says they demand punishment options "should include death." More of that all life is sacred bullshit.<br>
                            <br>
                            Yet, while they are busy demanding laws to incarcerate kids for sex, and perhaps execute a few of them, they claim they are in favor of limited government. Really? Limited by what principle?<br>
                            <br>
                            How limited is the small government they claim to believe in? Here are a few more clauses from the platform showing exactly how big they want government to be.<br>
                            <blockquote>
                                <span style="font-style:italic">We encourage state and federal governments to severely prosecute illegal dealers and manufacturers of addictive substances and pornography.</span> <span style="font-style:italic"><br>

                                Furthermore, criminal penalties should be created and experimenters prosecuted who participate in the cloning of human beings...<br>

                            The real kicker is that these morons claim to support individual rights and individual freedom.
