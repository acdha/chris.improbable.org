                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <a href="http://www.amconmag.com/larison/2010/06/11/the-green-movement/">Daniel Larison</a>, riffing on a Hooman Majd post commemorating the one year anniversary of the controversial Iranian election that&nbsp;helped spawn&nbsp;the Green movement, says much of what I was saying at the time, and would like to reiterate now - only he does it better.&nbsp; In particular, Larison discusses some of the&nbsp;"unassailable" conventional wisdom concerning the Green movement, its goals, its Western orientation and how the phenomenon should guide Obama administration policy.&nbsp; There is so much&nbsp;of&nbsp;value in Larison's post that I will take the liberty of an extended excerpt:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        ...I&nbsp;[want] to address Majd’s observation about the “unassailable” ideas he describes. He is absolutely right that these were the prevailing, overwhelmingly dominant ideas at the time, and to some extent they continue to be the default view of Western Green movement sympathizers. Iran hawks and other opponents of engagement with Iran took shelter behind these “unassailable” ideas in order to ridicule Obama for “weakness” and “appeasement” or to position themselves as idealistic friends of Iran’s democrats rather than the shabby, amoral, deal-making realists. To assail these ideas was to be considered a supporter of the Iranian regime, an apologist for Ahmadinejad, and all the rest of the insults opponents of the Iraq war had hurled at them seven and eight years ago. One of the reasons why I kept making counter-arguments against claims that the Green movement was going from strength to strength was that these arguments seemed to be built mostly on exaggeration and emotion, and there was never much evidence to persuade a skeptic that these arguments were correct. You were supposed to believe in the power of the Green movement because it felt like the right thing to believe, or else you were just a heartless villain rejoicing in the deaths of protestors. That was more or less the quality of the debate...What mattered was demonstrating empty solidarity with a movement most Westerners misunderstood and one that many wanted to use for their own ends.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One of the reasons I spent as much time as I have over the last year attacking and questioning the claims of Green movement sympathizers here in the U.S., is that it was quite clear to me that isolating and vilifying Iran can only strengthen the hand of the Iranian government at home, split the opposition, and distract Iranians from domestic grievances by creating an external challenge to Iranian sovereignty and nationalism. Nonetheless, this approach of isolation and vilification was exactly what most Western sympathizers urged the administration to adopt. Because there was so much outrage at how the Iranian government had treated its dissidents, Green movement sympathizers wanted nothing to do with engagement any longer, and this ended up aligning them in the debate with Iran hawks who saw the Green movement as a useful short-cut to “solve” the problems they have with Iran. The goal of regime change was still there, but the heavy lifting was going to be assigned to the Iranian opposition.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        One small problem with this was that this was not what the Iranian opposition wanted. As Majd explains, this is what Iranian exile groups and their Western supporters wanted the Iranian opposition to want, and it is what the exiles and Westerners claimed that they wanted. The exile groups were trying to turn what could have conceivably turned into a broader-based political protest movement into a politically non-viable anti-regime force. As Majd writes:
                                    </p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p>
                                            A raft of Iranian opposition groups and individuals, mostly abroad, have jumped aboard the Green train—in some cases even claiming the mantle of leadership—and their basic agenda (overthrow of the Islamic regime) invariably contradicts the Green Movement agenda (electoral transparency and civil rights). Statements of support from the much-despised Mujahedin-e Khalq, based in Paris, and the green wristband worn by the shah’s son Reza Pahlavi, were godsends to the government, which has from the start labeled the Green Movement a “velvet” or “color” revolution backed by foreigners. Green leaders have taken pains not to advocate the end of their government, since this is clearly the regime’s most potent charge against them. Though a few of their ranks may harbor seditious dreams, the movement writ large is about civil rights, not pro-Western revolution. [...]

                                        By celebrating them as radical revolutionaries and ignoring or downplaying the insider credentials of many of the movement’s figureheads, Western admirers imputed their own hopes to the movement and thereby did some significant political damage to the movement by portraying it as a subversive, anti-regime force. It would probably have been better to remain completely aloof and skeptical than offer this sort of harmful “support.” On the whole, the administration responded wisely for the first few months by saying as little as possible, but gradually came under pressure to pay more attention to the Green movement from the usual quarters that are always insisting that the U.S. “do something” about everything on the planet. Of course, this is a crucial part of the problem with much of the Western sympathy for the movement: unless it is an anti-regime force, it is of no use to the U.S. and the West, and it is therefore of little interest. As we have seen in recent years in their reactions to political changes in <a href="http://www.realclearworld.com/blog/2010/06/be_careful_what_you_wish_for_1.html">Turkey</a>, Japan, Brazil and other countries throughout Latin America, many democratists quickly lose interest in democratization abroad when it threatens to complicate things for the U.S.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Green movement has been struggling for Iranian rights and for the sake of their own country. Perhaps someday they or their successors will have some success, but whatever happens it has nothing to do with us. Unlike many of the “pro-Western” movements Washington has enthusiastically backed in the last ten years, the Green movement is not interested in dragging their countrymen against their will into a Western orbit in ways contrary to their national interests. What we cannot seem to abide here in the U.S. is the idea that there is a political reform movement in Iran that has emerged and developed pretty much entirely on its own, does not owe Washington anything for its existence, and does not particularly harbor “pro-Western” inclinations on contested issues. For a lot of its sympathizers, it has to be pursuing the same goals of regime change and compliance with Western demands, or it doesn’t really count. I agree with Majd that the assumption that the Green movement somehow needs U.S. support is insulting to Iranians, and more than that it reflects the fundamentally self-absorbed assumption of so many of our politicians and pundits that every great political change in the world can only be brought about through the exercise of American power and influence.

                                    Speaking of self-serving myths, Flyntt and Hillary Mann Leverett have a thought-provoking <a href="http://progressiverealist.org/blogpost/persistent-and-game-changing-myths-irans-2009-presidential-election-one-year-later">post</a> discussing the&nbsp;evidence, or lack thereof,&nbsp;of electoral fraud in the infamous 2009 election:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">

                                        Since manufactured claims about Iraqi WMD led the United States to invade Iraq in 2003, no analytic line about developments in the Middle East has had a bigger impact on American foreign policy than the assertion that the outcome of Iran’s June 12, 2009 presidential election—held one year ago tomorrow—was a fraud.&nbsp; Since shortly after the election, we have been subjected to a great deal of criticism (a disappointingly high percentage of it personal in nature) for arguing that no hard evidence of electoral fraud has been produced, and that Ahmadinejad’s re-election was, in fact, quite plausible as an outcome.&nbsp; Of course, these are arguments that went against the conventional wisdom that took root among most Western Iran “experts” literally on the morning after the election.&nbsp; &nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We stand by these judgments today.&nbsp; We are certainly not in a position to vouch personally for the physical handling of ballots, the counting process, etc.—in other words, we are not in a position to conclude definitively that there was no fraud in Iran’s 2009 presidential election.&nbsp; However, we continue to hold that no evidence of fraud has been produced, and that Ahmadinejad’s re-election, without fraud, was eminently plausible.&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We also believe that it should be incumbent on those who continue to assert that there was decisive fraud in the election to come up with hard evidence to support their claim—and not rely solely on “must have been” conjecture...
