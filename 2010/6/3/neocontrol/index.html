                                    <a href="http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/articles/display/the_nuclear_posture_attack#_ftn10">Robert Farley</a> has a very interesting piece on the reaction of the Republican Party establishment to Obama's resumption of Reagan-era arms control treaties with Russia, and what that reaction says about the evolution of foreign policy ideas in the GOP:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        Ironically, the attacks launched by the conservative foreign policy establishment against the Obama administration could also have been used against Ronald Reagan’s administration. The defense and nuclear policy of the Reagan administration is often understood as the zenith of hawkish, anti-Soviet sentiment. While this largely applies to Reagan’s first term in office, in the second term Reagan pursued far more conciliatory policies toward the Soviet Union and arms control. Reagan himself, as demonstrated by several historians, held almost radical views about the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons.<a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/#_ftn8" name="_ednref8" id="_ednref8"><font color="#D11010">[8]</font></a> In one famous case, Reagan’s advisers had to restrain him from coming to an overarching deal with Soviet premier, Mikhail Gorbachev, that would have substantially reduced global nuclear weapon stockpiles.<a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/#_ftn9" name="_ednref9" id="_ednref9"><font color="#D11010">[9]</font></a>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As Max Bergman, Deputy Policy Director at the National Security Network, has argued, a divide has emerged between the “realist” wing of the Republican foreign policy establishment and its more radical right-wing counterpart.<a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/#_ftn10" name="_ednref10" id="_ednref10"><font color="#D11010">[10]</font></a> The debate over nuclear policy has demonstrated that the latter now essentially dominates the institutional apparatus of right-wing foreign policy thinking. Ideas and arguments that were welcome in the Reagan administration can now find no purchase at Heritage, or the <em>Weekly Standard</em>, or anywhere else on the right.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Many of the moderate Republicans who favored arms control and engagement with the Soviet Union are still around, but they have minimal influence on the institutional right. Henry Kissinger, James Baker, Brent Scowcroft, Colin Powell, and George Schultz have all played key roles in developing foreign policy for multiple Republican administrations. However, none have developed an extensive base within the institutional right wing, the constellation of independent organizations and foundations (including the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute) that have emerged as key players in internal Republican Party debates. This faction has, by and large, concluded that the greatest threat posed by Russian nuclear weapons is loss, theft, or accidental launch, rather than pre-emptive attack. [...]

                                        In addition, prominent political figures have been able to promote the studies and reports produced by these groups, including for instance Sarah Palin, who despite her clear lack of knowledge on the subject tried to use that hardline rhetoric in attacking Obama’s arms control initiatives.
                                    </p>

                                    Sarah Palin, though almost obsessive in her repeated praise and evocation of Reagan, seems entirely ignorant of her implied criticism of Reagan's actual arms control policies.  Farley continues:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">

                                        Over the past month, the question of “cognitive closure” on the right has been discussed extensively in the blogosphere. Cognitive closure refers to the concept that the Republican political establishment and major conservative pundits review information from within a very limited circle of sources. The nuclear critique mounted by the right wing represents an example of conservative “cognitive closure,” with the ironic outcome that those most eager to wave the banner of the Reagan administration’s foreign policy are offering arguments that Reagan himself would have rejected. [...]
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The nature of these attacks against the Obama administration’s nuclear policy are not so much evidence of a battle within conservative foreign policy circles as they are a sign of the ascendancy of one particular faction. One key to achieving this dominant position in the discourse on the right has been the establishment and nurturing of institutions for developing and promoting their views. The wing of the GOP foreign policy establishment once regarded as “realist” failed to construct an institutional structure to develop and promulgate its ideas. Consequently, the major organs of conservative foreign policy-making now follow one line, serious debate is marginalized, and there are fewer new voices on the right arguing for responsible nuclear weapons policy.
                                    </p>

                                    I would only add that while Farley is right that the neocon wing is prone to heap effusive praise on Reagan's foreign policy despite deriding the particulars, the incoherence has roots.  During Reagan's tenure, the same neocon thinkers, pundits, periodicals and institutions were highly critical of Reagan's arms control measures and his outreach to Gorbachev (both of which were highly successful measures). 
                                </p>

                                    In short, the neoconservative trend has been more hawkish than Reagan from the outset.  Also, consistenly wrong.  Nevertheless, they have clearly come to dominate the Republican Party almost entirely.
