                            <p>
                                Many scientists and engineers can trace their interest in a topic to a handful of events that really opened their eyes to what is possible. For me, it was the day in middle school when, instead of our normal classes, we were tasked with building an&nbsp;18-inch-long&nbsp;bridge that could support 30 pounds, using nothing but duct tape and construction paper. I recall that my team did not win, but the exercise really showed me how much fun engineering can be. (It also taught me an life-long lesson about the importance of duct tape.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A paper in the current edition of the <a href="http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content">American Chemical Society's</a> <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/journal/ancham"><span>Analytical Chemistry</span></a>&nbsp;looks at bringing microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip devices to grade-school children with the help of <a href="http://brands.kraftfoods.com/jello/">Jello</a>. Typically, microfluidic devices are constructed using soft-lithography techniques and elastomeric materials like polydimethylsiloxane (which, as an aside, is a blast to play with all by itself). These materials are used to create flow channels and mixing chambers with features that are on the order of microns in width.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Clearly, these scales are unattainable in grade-school classrooms, and wouldn't be all that interesting anyway, as the devices would be too small to see with the naked eye. However, larger devices with a similar function can be an effective learning tool.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The authors of the paper use Jello, along with coffee stirrers and popsicle sticks, as channel molds for a trio of experiments that illustrate some of the key concepts behind microfluidic devices.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The microfluidic devices are created by pouring Jello over the wooden channel molds and allowing it to cure until set. Once firm, the sticks are removed from the Jello and the gelatinous treat is placed on aluminum plates, where it forms a tight seal everywhere but the spaces where the molds were—those leave a raised channel behind.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first of the three potential experiments demonstrates pressure-driven flow. Fluid is injected into one end of the device and, if an appropriate outlet is present, students can observe how the fluid moves down the length of the channel—the authors suggest using lemon Jello, as its translucent yellow color makes for easy science viewing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Release the pressure pushing the fluid, and it will no longer flow through the channel. The fact that the channel is initially filled with air can be highlighted by attempting to push fluid through without a suitable outlet. Once the pressure gets high enough, the seal with the aluminum plate will break, causing fluid to go everywhere.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The second experiment can be carried out using a device that has a Y-shaped channel carved into it. Pure water is injected into one arm;&nbsp;the other gets water that has been mixed with blue food dye. Students will see that the two streams don't mix, even after they merge together at the Y-junction.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is due to the nature of the laminar flows, where almost all mixing is controlled by diffusion alone. The authors point out that, for more advanced students, this experiment allows the introduction of dimensionless numbers such as the Reynolds number (the ratio of inertial to viscous forces) and the Peclet number (ratio of convective mass transfer to diffusive mass transfer). Typically, these wouldn't be encountered until a college-level engineering or physics course.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The final experiment involves an actual Jello lab-on-a-chip. Strips of litmus paper, used for determining the pH of a solution, are placed in series—one to detect basic solutions and one to detect acidic solutions—in at least two parallel channels. The use of parallel channels illustrates how a real lab-on-a-chip device allows a single reagent (or multiple reagents) to be tested many times at once.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The authors demonstrate the use of the Jello device by flowing sodium hydroxide down one channel and hydrochloric acid down the other. The litmus paper quickly determines which is which; useful, since they will look identical to each other and to water. For younger children. less harsh reagents, such as baking soda and vinegar, can be used. But where's the fun in that?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For those that participate in classroom or other science outreach programs, this can be a powerful new demonstration to add to your arsenal. It's also topical, as microfluidic devices are becoming more common in biological and chemical research. As more complete laboratories on a chip are developed and utilized in research labs, they will ultimately find their way into consumer products, at which point it will be good for the public to have at least a basic understanding of the principles involved. Bonus points here for the fact that once you are done, you can eat your laboratory (not recommended for any Jello used to differentiate NaOH from HCl).
