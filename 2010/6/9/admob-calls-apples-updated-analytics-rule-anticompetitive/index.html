                                With the upcoming update to iOS 4 (<em>née</em> iPhone OS), Apple modified the developer agreement to eliminate collection of analytics information by third parties. The latest revision of those terms will allow some data to be shared, as long as the third party has Apple approval, but still blocks mobile advertising firms owned or affiliated with competing mobile operating systems—<a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/06/apple-welcomes-indie-advertising-companies-shuts-out-admob.ars" title="Ars Technica: Apple welcomes indie advertising companies, shuts out AdMob">like the Google-owned AdMob</a>—from getting such data. AdMob founder Omar Hamoui is <a href="http://blog.admob.com/2010/06/09/mobile-advertising-and-the-iphone/" title="The Life and Times of AdMob: Mobile advertising and the iPhone">calling Apple's move anti-competition and anti-consumer</a>, but we're not so sure that's the case.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Apple CEO Steve Jobs <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/06/jobs-the-ipad-begat-the-iphone-not-the-other-way-around.ars" title="Ars Technica: Jobs: the iPad begat the iPhone, not the other way around">explained last week</a> at the D8 conference the reasoning behind the changes: one, to help protect user privacy; and two, to keep information about Apple's unreleased products out of the hands of its competitors. Jobs singled out third-party analytics firm Flurry, which had very nearly <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/01/itablets-or-iphones-firm-fingers-50-devices-in-testing.ars" title="Ars Technica: iTablets or iPhones? Firm fingers 50 devices in testing">outed the iPad</a> just two days before Apple's official announcement. But he stated emphatically that the move was not about banning rivals from Apple's iAd service.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, AdMob isn't convinced. The new changes specifically prohibit AdMob from collecting any user or device information by virtue of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/05/google-says-thanks-apple-as-750m-admob-deal-approved.ars" title="Ars Technica: Google says 'Thanks, Apple!' as $750M AdMob deal approved">being owned by Google</a> (emphasis ours):

                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    3.3.9 You and Your Applications may not collect, use, or disclose to any third party, user or device data without prior user consent, and then only under the following conditions:
                                </p>
                                <ul>

                                    </li>
                                    <li>The collection, use or disclosure is for the purpose of serving advertising to Your Application; is provided to an independent advertising service provider whose primary business is serving mobile ads (for example, <em>an advertising service provider owned by or affiliated with a developer or distributor of mobile devices, mobile operating systems</em> or development environments other than Apple would not qualify as independent); and the disclosure is limited to UDID, user location data, and other data specifically designated by Apple as available for advertising purposes.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                            <p>
                                These changes still block third-party analytics companies like Flurry from collecting data, but allow developers latitude to collect their own analytics when necessary. The changes also allow independent mobile ad companies to collect certain information once approved by Apple, but it leaves AdMob unable to collect such data. "Without access to device data we would not be able to serve relevant ads and thus deliver good monetization for developers and results for advertisers," said AdMob spokesperson Nicole Leverich. "For example, we could be serving an ad for an iPad app on an iPhone—which is not relevant for that consumer—which means we'd not be able to monetize well for developers and would not deliver good returns for advertisers."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are certainly a few scenarios where it would be possible to deliver more targeted ads and even collect some useful analytic data without explicitly collecting detailed user or device information prohibited by the revised agreement. That might leave AdMob at somewhat of a competitive disadvantage with respect to offering developers extensive analytics for advertising on the iOS platform. On the other hand, AdMob could have remained independent instead of choosing to join forces with Google after <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/01/apple-acquires-its-own-mobile-ad-firm-to-one-up-google.ars" title="Ars Techinca: Apple acquires its own mobile ad firm to one-up Google">rejecting Apple's offer</a> to become the basis for iAd.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Though AdMob and Apple seem to be behaving somewhat like lovers scorned, Hamoui thinks the situation is far more dire. "This change threatens to decrease—or even eliminate—revenue that helps to support tens of thousands of developers," he wrote on the AdMob blog. "The terms hurt both large and small developers by severely limiting their choice of how best to make money. And because advertising funds a huge number of free and low cost apps, these terms are bad for consumers as well."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Apple's rules require developers to inform users when their data is being shared, while also limiting whom that data can be shared with—arguably a pro-consumer, not anti-consumer policy. That may force AdMob to either be more creative in the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/06/admob-tosses-in-ipad-support-to-compete-with-iad.ars" title="Ars Technica: AdMob tosses in iPad support to compete with iAd">ad products it offers</a>, or abandon the iOS platform completely. However, there are other ad networks besides AdMob and iAd for developers to choose from.&nbsp;
