                                <span style='font-family:Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif'>Of course, no one who follows race horse history could be entirely surprised by that finding. For one thing, it built on preliminary results from 2006.

                            <div align="justify">
                                <span style='font-family:Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif'>After all, gamblers in Australia had earlier tried to shoot the big horse.</span>

                                <span style='font-family:Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif'>The Wonder Horse -- one of his many nicknames, along with the Red Terror -- was born in October 1926 in New Zealand and&nbsp;thought to have so little promise that he was purchased as a two-year-old by American businessman David J. Davis for about $130 (US). As the story goes, when the gangly youngster shambled into sight, the new owner was so horrified, he refused to pay to train him. The Australian trainer, Harry Telford, offered to train the colt for free in exchange for eventual part ownership of the horse.</span>

He'd matured into a beautiful, powerful chestnut with a cheerful disposition and a drive to win. Too much of a winner, some thought. On November 1, 1930, the day of the prestigous Melbourne Cup, a car started following him on the way back from morning practice and shots -- apparently ordered by a rival owner -- were fired at the big horse. They missed, and no one was ever caught although a furious Davis offered a $100 reward, huge for the time. Phar Lap, though, remained unfazed. And won the race.</span>
                            </div><br>
                            <span style='font-family:Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif'>In fact, it was one of 14 straight victories that year, followed by 14 straight victories in 1931. In his four-year racing career, Phar Lap ran hard and often and fast. He won 37 of 51 races, and that would include his last.</span><br>

                                <span style='font-family:Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif'>Davis, by now enamoured of his bargain colt, decided to enter him in an international big prize race, the Agua Caliente Handicap, at a track near Tijuana, Mexico. The purse for the winner of that race would be more than $11,000 (comparable to about $100,000 today). Although Telford was reluctant, Phar Lap was shipped by boat to Mexico. In a hard-fought race, he once again triumphed in a flying finish, still watchable, in fact, in a</span> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bROtR5ivyZw"><span style='font-family:Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif'>YouTube</span></a> <span style='font-family:Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif'>video.</span>

                                <span style='font-family:Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif'>Davis had moved him to a private ranch near Menlo Park, California, while he negotiated for entrance into other lucrative private races. On that morning of April 5, 1932, one of the stablehands found the big horse convulsing in agony. Phar Lap died several hours later. Speculation of deliberate poisoning has followed his&nbsp;story&nbsp;ever since, although alternative theories have been offered -- from severe gastroenteritis to accidental poisoning from the use of pesticides on the ranch.</span>

Davis, after consulting with Telford, decided to send Phar Lap's "great" heart to Australia's National Institute of Anatomy in Canberra. The skeleton went to the Dominion Museum in New Zealand. And the hide was sent to the</span> <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/pharlap/"><span style='font-family:Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif'>National Museum of Victoria</span></a><span style='font-family:Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif'>, in Melbourne, where taxidermists labored for four months to create a life-like replica of the Wonder Horse, from his shining red coat to his tousled mane.</span>

                                <span style='font-family:Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif'>In the years since his death, songs have been written to the horse, movies been made about his life story. But it's that mane that eventually solved the mystery of what -- if not who -- killed Phar Lap. Australian researchers removed six hairs and then used a highly specialized x-ray microsope to bombard them with intense radiation, illuminating the chemical makeup of the hair. The analysis (done at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois) is so precise that it allows scientists to tell whether material was absorbed from the blood or introduced after death, such as through embalming processes.</span>

I'm glad that researchers in Australia were so determined to find some answers about the death of Phar Lap, even it serves only to remind us of the realities of the American horse racing business of the 1930s, with its underpinnings of crooked money and sweaty desperation.</span>
