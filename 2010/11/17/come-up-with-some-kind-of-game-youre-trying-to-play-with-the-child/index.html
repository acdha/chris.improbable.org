                        <blockquote>
                            Previously <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5688087/the-tsas-sense-of-humor-makes-me-nervous">a fake children's book</a>, my First Cavity Search. Now in reality three-year-old Mandy Simon started crying when her teddy bear had to go through the X-ray machine at airport security in Chattanooga, Tenn. She was so upset that she refused to go calmly through the metal detector, setting it off twice. Agents then informed her parents that she "must be hand-searched." The subsequent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJNY_PTULO4">TSA employee pat down of the screaming child</a> was captured by her father, who happened to be a reporter, on his cell phone.<br>
                            <br>
                            The TSA regional security director comments in the story to advise how TSA agents should search a young child: "Come up with some kind of game you're trying to play with the child, makes it a a lot easier."<br>
                            <br>
                            It has also emerged the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1330569/Fury-airport-security-staff-caught-camera-body-searching-crying-3-year-old-girl.html?ito=feeds-newsxml">TSA is being sued</a> for a an incident at the Corpus Christi airport when a woman's breasts were exposed. An unnamed 23-year-old college student was allegedly singled out for 'extended search procedures' before flying in 2008. 'As the TSA agent was frisking plaintiff, the agent pulled the plaintiff's blouse completely down, exposing plaintiffs' breasts to everyone in the area,' the Amarillo Globe-News quotes the lawsuit as saying. 'As would be expected, plaintiff was extremely embarrassed and humiliated.'<br>
                            <br>
                            The suit also claims staff joked about the woman's breasts. 'One male TSA employee expressed to the plaintiff that he wished he would have been there when she came through the first time and that 'he would just have to watch the video,' the lawsuit said.<br>
                            <br>
                            At a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/11/tsa-boss-our-patdowns-turn-up-artfully-concealed-objects.ars">Senate oversight hearing today</a>, Transportation Security Administration head John Pistole explained that TSA agents really do need to encounter testicular resistance when performing their newly enhanced airport pat-downs. Since switching to the new pat-downs in the last few weeks, "We have detected dozens and dozens of, let's say, 'artfully concealed objects'" that could pose a risk to flight, said Pistole.<br>
                            <br>
                            John Pistole also said he "understood" the concerns (and he added that children under 12 weren't subject to the enhanced pat-down). When one senator asked if this "understanding" meant changes were coming, Pistole was direct. "Am I going to change the policies? No."<br>
                            <br>
                            <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/744199---israelification-high-security-little-bother">Some criticise the TSA approach to security as ineffective</a>. "It is mindboggling for us Israelis to look at what happens in North America, because we went through this 50 years ago," said Rafi Sela.<br>
                            <br>
                            "We said, 'We're not going to do this. You're going to find a way that will take care of security without touching the efficiency of the airport."<br>
                            <br>
                            "We have a saying in Hebrew that it's much easier to look for a lost key under the light, than to look for the key where you actually lost it, because it's dark over there. That's exactly how (North American airport security officials) act," Sela said. "You can easily do what we do. You don't have to replace anything. You have to add just a little bit â€” technology, training. But you have to completely change the way you go about doing airport security. And that is something that the bureaucrats have a problem with. They are very well enclosed in their own concept."
