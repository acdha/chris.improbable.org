                                Commemorative cocktail names act as a sort of alcoholic telegraph, a filtered, patchy, and somewhat unreliable headline service calling out public figures, trends, or events, from <a href="http://bonvivantevents.com/wordpress/2009/01/13/inauguration-cocktails/">Obama’s inauguration</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_%28cocktail%29">introduction of a new steam engine</a>.

                                While one would be hard-pressed to find a salad or casserole named after military weaponry, the <a href="http://www.esquire.com/drinks/french-75-drink-recipe">French 75</a> — a tongue-tingling concoction of champagne, gin, lemon juice, and sugar — is an offering found on many a cocktail menu. It was, in fact, named in tribute to a 75-mm quick-firing gun used widely during World War I.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Commemorative cocktails are born out of an incredible assortment of historical events, from monumental achievements and epic heroes to fleeting trends and otherwise insignificant peculiarities. The poetic bartenders (or publicists) who imagined the mixed drinks described below were commemorating, in liquid form, a host of special events, people, places, and innovations. And, yes, even the occasional scandal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The rather delightful result is that even the most news-averse barfly can keep up-to-date on current events, from union strikes to space travel, simply by sampling fresh additions to the cocktail menu.

                                In David Wondrich’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399532870?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ediblgeogr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0399532870"><em>Imbibe!</em></a>, a fascinating portrait of the nineteenth-century bartender <a href="http://www.artofdrink.com/jerry-thomas/">Jerry Thomas</a>, Wondrich specifically calls out Thomas’ recipe for the Japanese Cocktail as “a fine example of yet another Cocktail-naming gambit, the commemorative Cocktail.” The story, as Wondrich tells it, began in 1860 when the <a href="http://www.mcny.org/exhibitions/past/Samurai-in-New-York.html">first Japanese delegation to the United States</a> ended their tour in New York. Of the many esteemed guests from Japan, one became more infamous than the others. <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/weai/firstjapaneseamb.html">Tommy</a>, as he was commonly referred to in the American media, was an English-speaking member of the Japanese delegation whose fondness for both pretty women and booze formed the subject of several newspaper articles. Wondrich deduces that since Tommy and company were staying at the Metropolitan Hotel, just one block from the bar where Jerry Thomas was mixologist-in-residence, the bartender created a drink in their honor — or lack thereof.

                                After what the <em>New York Times</em> referred to as “many wearisome days of fruitless squabbling,” on May 3, 1926, roughly three million members of England’s largest labor union, the <a href="http://www.tuc.org.uk/">Trades Union Congress</a> (TUC), went <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/britain/generalstrikerev1.shtml">on strike</a> in support of British coal miners whose pay was being decreased despite increased working hours. The strike’s members included workers in England’s transportation and building trades; iron, steel and metal workers; and workers in the paper and printing industries. A nation-wide shutdown was only narrowly averted by the efforts of volunteer workers. The TUC finally called off the strike on May 12, 1926.

                                On July 25, 1969, a small article ran in the <em>New York Times</em> announcing the “Moonshot,” a cocktail created by French champagne and cognac producers to commemorate the Apollo 11 flight. The publicist for the French producers—the Moonshot was unveiled not at a bar but at a press conference—pointed out that the drink is best served on the rocks, because, as he correctly noted, “the moon’s surface is rock.”

                                While not a cocktail in the traditional sense, the “Client #9 Champagne Oyster Shooter” appeared on the menu of the Grand Central Oyster Bar on March 12, 2008, the same day that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/10/nyregion/10cnd-spitzer.html">Eliot Spitzer</a> announced his resignation as governor of New York. Spitzer was referred to as Client #9 in an FBI affidavit detailing the operations of the Emperor’s Club, a high-end prostitution service that Spitzer frequented. When his scandalous assignations were leaked to the media, the Oyster Bar was there to commemorate it. The price for the champagne oyster shooter was jokingly listed at $5,000 but actually only cost an easy-to-swallow $7.95.
