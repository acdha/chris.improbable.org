                                A week ago, Politico <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/44888.html">reported</a> that "in a series of one-on-one conversations with incoming and sitting senators, McConnell is encouraging his colleagues to keep an open mind and not to automatically side with DeMint, whose plan calls on Senate Republicans to unilaterally give up earmarks in the 112th Congress." That was not, for McConnell, good press, as in a series of publicly available blog posts and radio rants and op-ed columns, the conservative movement began taking him apart. Now, he's seen the light:

                                    Bringing about real change is hard work. It requires elected officials — whether they’re in their first week or their 50th year in office — to challenge others and, above all, to challenge themselves to do things differently from time to time, to question, and then to actually shake up the status quo in pursuit of a goal or a vision that the voters have set for the good of our country.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I have thought about these things long and hard over the past few weeks. I’ve talked with my members. I’ve listened to them. Above all, I have listened to my constituents. And what I’ve concluded is that on the issue of congressional earmarks, as the leader of my party in the Senate, I have to lead first by example. Nearly every day that the Senate’s been in session for the past two years, I have come down to this spot and said that Democrats are ignoring the wishes of the American people. When it comes to earmarks, I won’t be guilty of the same thing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Make no mistake. I know the good that has come from the projects I have helped support throughout my state. I don’t apologize for them. But there is simply no doubt that the abuse of this practice has caused Americans to view it as a symbol of the waste and the out-of-control spending that every Republican in Washington is determined to fight. And unless people like me show the American people that we’re willing to follow through on small or even symbolic things, we risk losing them on our broader efforts to cut spending and rein in government.
                                </p>

                                I take this as a good move, though: Eliminating earmarks is one of those things that conservative activists are simply right about. Yes, it's only about 1 percent of the budget, and yes, many of the programs funded through earmarks are worthwhile, but it also feeds D.C.'s massive lobbying complex, and in general, it's not a wise way to spend federal money.
