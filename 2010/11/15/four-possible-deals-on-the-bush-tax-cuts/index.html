                                The Bush tax cuts will not be permanently extended. But they -- or at least some of them -- will be temporarily extended. That we don't know which ones, or for how long, should embarrass Congress and the White House. The expiration date for the tax cuts was set into law 10 years ago. Congress shouldn't still be scrambling to figure this out with less than 50 days to go.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But it is. And it's the Democrats -- as they still control both houses of Congress and the presidency -- who deserve the blame. They still have not settled on a policy or strategy for extending the Bush tax cuts. They waited until after the election, which weakened their hand. And they've been unable to get their members on the same page, which has kept them from messaging the issue to the country or forcing Republicans to the negotiating table.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Which is a shame, because even an extension of the tax cuts is a much-needed legislative opportunity for a reeling party that desperately needs some political and procedural leverage over the Republicans. Democrats being Democrats, it's entirely possible that they'll take neither, and simply extend the tax cuts outright. But talks with informed sources both on and off the Hill revealed not just a lot of frustration with the possibility of that outcome, but a lot of sensible ideas for negotiating something better. So here are four concessions that Democrats should be looking to get out of the resolution:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>1) Unemployment insurance:</strong> In a few weeks, unemployment benefits will <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/15/voters-dont-want-congress_n_783687.html">expire</a> for 2 million Americans. An extension of the benefits commands <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/15/voters-dont-want-congress_n_783687.html">majority support</a> among Democrats, Republicans and independents. But most Hill observers think Congress will fail to act. It would be unconscionable, however, to let unemployment benefits expire even as the tax cuts for the rich are continued. If Republicans aren't willing to come to the table on unemployment benefits, Democrats shouldn't move on tax cuts for the wealthy. And if they're not willing to take that case to the public, what are they good for, exactly?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>2) The debt ceiling:</strong> In February, Congress will have to vote to lift the debt ceiling. Republicans are already <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/nov/7/looming-debt-vote-could-spark-spending-showdown/">looking toward</a> this moment eagerly. Sen. Jim DeMint, for instance, wants to use it as leverage for "returning to 2008 spending levels" and "repealing Obamacare." Of course, part of the reason the debt ceiling will have to rise is that extending the Bush tax cuts will cost about $4 trillion -- all of it on the deficit. If Republicans want the tax cuts, Democrats should force them to accept the consequences of their vote and stand shoulder-to-shoulder on the debt ceiling. For Democrats to vote to extend Bush's tax cuts and then let Republicans hammer them on raising the debt ceiling borders on self-parody.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>3) Comprehensive tax reform:</strong> Our tax code is long-overdue for an overhaul. We need to clean out the loopholes, lower the rates and get rid of the tricks and traps (like, for instance, the occasional expiration of unaffordable tax cuts). The Bush tax cuts offer a useful forcing mechanism for that process: Sen. Kent Conrad has <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703585004575604890565234512.html">proposed</a> pairing a short extension with a mandate for comprehensive tax reform. If the reform doesn't pass, then rates snap back to their 1999 levels, or deductions start taking across-the-board cuts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>4) The expiration of the tax cuts for income over $250,000:</strong> This was originally the White House's position, though they don't seem to be fighting for it very hard. Now it's the <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/11/liberals_to_dem_leaders_hold_a.html">position</a> of the House Progressive Caucus. They want to split the vote on the tax cuts for the rich from the vote on the tax cuts for income under $250,000. It's <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/251641/obama-s-decoupling-proposal-trap-josh-barro">widely acknowledged</a> that this makes the passage of the tax cuts for the rich less likely, which is why Republicans are ferociously resisting it. it's unclear exactly what leverage they're wielding in that effort, but whatever it is, it seems to be working.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's worth saying, again and again, that the Bush tax cuts cannot pass without Democratic support. They expire before the House changes hands. And even if they didn't, Democrats still control the Senate and the White House. They have a much stronger negotiating position than the Republicans: They can decide what passes, and Republicans have never been willing to end the tax cuts for most Americans simply to preserve the tax cuts for the rich. But though they're the party in charge, Democrats aren't acting like it.
