                                <br>
                            </p>

                                AMERICANS, to a large extent, have only themselves to blame for the state of the economy. They consumed a lot that they did not want to or could not pay for. Cheap capital from abroad and easy mortgages fueled veracious consumption habits. Americans can blame China or Wall Street for offering loose credit in the first place. But in the end they, too, played a role. If anything undermines America’s economic future, it is the belief that its residents are entitled to more than they can afford.<br>

                                There are few ways to explain this but perhaps this is the most clear and obvious: When people try to buy too much the market responds by raising prices and forcing them to buy less. There are various prices that are relevant in Schrager’s analysis: mortgage rates, the consumer price index, the price of imports and conversely the value of the dollar.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At the peak of this crisis, every single one of those prices was falling. Mortgage rates were falling. Government interest rates were falling. Foreigners were desperate to lend us more money, not less. The dollar was rising and hence our foreign purchasing power was increasing. The consumer price index was declining, not spiraling out of control.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most importantly, American-made goods were piling up in warehouses and on car lots. We were producing more than people were willing to buy. Could we really be living beyond our means when our factories were pumping out more cars than we were taking home? Were we living beyond our means when our construction workers were building more houses than we were living in?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                How can you be over-consuming when people are being laid off because there is so much stuff sitting around that no one is going to consume? In short, over-consuming should mean that we run out of stuff, not that we have too much.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The confusion arises because Shrager is thinking in terms of money. For a household, the amount of money it takes in is a fair proxy for how much it produces, and the amount of money it lays out it is a fair proxy for how much it consumes. Thus a shortage of money means that you have consumed more than you produced.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Countries, however, don’t work this way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In a country, when one person spends money, another person receives it. In a country, when one person borrows, another person lends. In a country, when one person consumes, another person produces.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The observation that we “ran out” of money is correct. However, for a country, that means that the central bank – in our case the Federal Reserve -- isn’t printing enough. Once we realize that, the circle squares.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, it should make sense that inflation would fall, because inflation rises when the Federal Reserve prints a lot of money. It should also make sense that the dollar would rise, because the dollar falls when the Federal Reserve prints a lot of money.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A lack of money was the problem, but for a country, that doesn’t mean overspending, it means underprinting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Note, I am not suggesting that the Federal Reserve actively caused the crisis. In a later post, hopefully, I can get to how the banking system creates private money and how a collapse of some major banks meant that hundreds of billions of dollars in privately created money was destroyed in a matter of weeks.
