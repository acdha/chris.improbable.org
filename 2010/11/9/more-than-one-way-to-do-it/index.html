                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <strong>By Thoreau</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I don’t quite agree with <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/11/my-application-for-peter-thiel">Matt Yglesias</a> that successful businessmen are merely lucky.  (I suspect that he is deliberately leaving out some nuance to make a provocative and important point.)  I would say that success is a mix of luck and talent, and it’s often impossible to actually know the extent to which talent vs. luck mattered, so we should be cautious in assuming that the successful actually know what they’re talking about.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Moreover, I think it’s generally true that we should be reluctant to assume that an successful model reflects The Best Way.  A long time ago I took a class on organizational communications, mostly focused on businesses.  The professor presented it from the viewpoint of the history of the field, and how organizational theorists have over time favored different models for a well-run organization.  Some of those models are hierarchical, some are quite the opposite, some models are well-informed by ample data, others are airy-fairy theorizing, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Near the end of the term I observed to the professor that over the millenia there have been lots and lots of successful enterprises run on numerous different models, some of them quite compatible with one theory or another, and many of those theories contradictory.  I also observed that his historical view starts off with very hierarchical theories, and presents decentralized organizations as some newfangled thing for our era of global trade and electronic communication, even though global trade in an earlier era would have required far more delegation to subordinates who cannot be easily contacted on a daily basis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He didn’t have a good response.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, I’m left to conclude that while a successful businessman may or may not have a Grand General Insight Into What Works, those who merely observe successful businessmen and then try to generalize are probably even less likely to have a Grand General Insight Into What Works.  The world is simply too complicated for that, and far too many people have succeeded, whether by luck or by skill, in far too many different ways, for me to say that there must be One Model To Rule Them All.
                            </p>
