                        <blockquote>
                            I've been thinking a lot about the new backscatter x-rays that the TSA has implemented at many airports across the nation. For those who haven't heard of these, they're full-body x-rays that allow a TSA agent to basically see you naked. They can see your boobs, your genitalia, etc. All passengers have to go through it. They have the option to opt-out, but if you do that, the TSA gives you a <em>thorough</em> pat-down. I'm talking groping: groping your breasts, your testicles, etc. The idea is that the majority of passengers are not going to opt for this extensive pat-down and will go through the x-ray. Neither option is good, frankly, and both are horribly invasive of a person's privacy. The x-ray will allow the TSA agent to see *everything*: how big your dick is, if you're transgender, if you've had a mastectomy, etc. And last night, I learned that there are major safety concerns about this x-ray. I'm not talking Jenny McCarthy fake science concerns. I'm talking <a href="http://www.npr.org/assets/news/2010/05/17/concern.pdf">major UCSF research scientist concerns</a>.<br>
                            <br>
                            This debate became very personal when Ed and I were in Hawaii. We were to fly from Lihue to Hilo partway through our honeymoon. In Lihue, we encountered active backscatter x-rays for the first time. I knew that I was allowed to opt out, but at the time I was tired, hungry, cranky, and had to pee. I was in no mood to handle what basically amounts to physical assault by a stranger. The abstract invasion of my privacy -- the knowledge that someone in another room was seeing me "naked" -- seemed more "appealing" than the very concrete invasion of my physical privacy. I knew I chose "correctly" as I watched the woman in front of me, who had opted out, have her cleavage fully groped. But now that I've learned just how unstudied and potentially dangerous these x-ray machines are, I feel even more betrayed by my country than I did before. I am horrified that I unknowingly subjected myself to a possibly cancer-creating machine. I guess I implicitly trusted that they'd done their research and wouldn't put people in unsafe conditions, but in retrospect that was a stupid assumption to make.<br>
                            <br>
                            Here's the thing that I haven't seen discussed. Throughout this whole debate I've watched many men posturing about how they're going to make the TSA grope their nads, about how clearly this was the correct option and how this gave them the opportunity to make TSA squirm. However, I've never seen a woman say these things. I've never heard a woman say, "I'd rather be groped." I'm sure they're out there, but the reality is, women have to be a <em>lot</em> more protective of their personal physical space. While I personally am lucky enough to have never been physically or sexually assaulted, I have most certainly felt objectified and been subjected to street harrassment. I don't generally dress sexy because I don't like the attention it gets. Women must constantly be on guard, especially given that we are often physically not as large or strong as men. Thus, an extremely invasive physical pat-down is likely to be a lot more unappealing to a woman than a man, and in many cases, depending on the woman's personal history, is going to be a highly triggering event. These new "security" measures unfairly target women. What are your thoughts? Do you agree/disagree? If you are a woman, would you go through the x-ray or would you get the pat-down?<br>
                            <br>
                            I tweeted about how TSA made me cry on my honeymoon, but I never went into details. I suppose now is as good a time as any. After going through the backscatter x-ray -- already feeling pissed and vulnerable after the invasion of my privacy -- I was informed by a TSA agent that they need to go through my carry-on bag. I never check bags because I don't trust airports to not lose my luggage, so my carry-on had <em>everything</em> in it-- and it was jam-packed because I had over packed. It'd taken me like a half hour to pack it earlier that morning. "Are you serious?!" I asked the guy. He was. I had the presence of mind to ask for a private space, so he and another (male) agent took me into a small room, without Ed, and started going through my bag. Imagine you're a woman on her honeymoon. Imagine the kind of items you might pack in that situation. The agent proceeded to take out EVERY SINGLE ITEM, every pair of lacy underwear and bra, etc., pick it up, fondle it, and squeeze it - things that only my husband was ever supposed to see or touch. I felt myself losing it so I asked if my husband could come in. They were happy to oblige. After another minute or two of watching this guy go through my most personal belongings, I completely lost it and started bawling. The second agent asked Ed, "Is she okay? What's wrong?" As he held my hand and tried to comfort me, Ed explained, "It's the invasion of privacy." No, of course I was not okay. They offered to let me go outside while they went through the rest of my stuff and I told them it wouldn't do any good. It was not that I was having to watch them do this - it was that they were doing it at all. I was fortunate in that both agents were <em>very</em> professional - no lewd comments, snickering, or anything like that - but it was the system that led us into this situation that upset me. When they were done, they left the room and let me pack my bag back up. And that is how TSA made me cry on my honeymoon.<br>
                            <br>
                            "Security theater" was always stupid and annoying, but with the implementation of these new backscatter x-rays/thorough pat-downs, it has crossed a line into exceedingly, insultingly invasive. It is an outrage when a government-sanctioned agency treats thousands of ordinary citizens as criminals <em>every day</em> and subjects them to potentially dangerous procedures while they're at it.
