                                Over at Racialicious, Guest-poster Renina Jarmon considers a post I wrote a few months ago about For Colored Girls, as an example of my <a href="http://www.racialicious.com/2010/11/09/ta-nehisi-coates-asked-is-for-colored-girls-a-classic-my-response/">rather woeful gender politics</a>:

                                I have found Ta-Nehisi's Black gender politics to be lacking on his blog and in some ways the questioning of whether or not For Colored Girls is classic symbolizes some of what troubles me about his Black gender politics.

                                    When reading this post Moya asked me two questions. The first was, "Why does it matter to Ta-Nehisi Coates whether For Colored Girls is a classic?" The second is "Is he saying that because it is not a classic that it doesn't matter if Tyler Perry butchers it?" 
                                </div>

                                    This is not to say that For Colored Girls should not be questioned. Work around Black gender relations should be given a critical eye. The issue for me is his reliance on his memory as a basis for questioning whether or not it is a classic.

                                    What does it mean that a Black man, at a popular White publication openly questions whether or not a work by Black feminist artist is a classic, having not read the work since his was younger?

                                        Given Ta-Nehisi's ability to dig in deep on a topic, AND the audience and platform that he has, he could conceivably impact the tone and content of Black gender discourse in profound ways.

                                A few things. When my book came out a some years ago, and I was basically a struggling freelancer with no shiny Atlantic blog, Renina was nice enough to check it out and review it rather favorably. I could be wrong, but I believe she was the first person to do this--surely she was one of the first. I'm in her debt for that, and still, deeply appreciative. 
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <br>

                                Second, I think it's generally a bad idea to question the place of any work in the canon, when you have actually recently interacted with the work. I think I assumed ownership that wasn't actually mine. I tried to <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2010/03/open-thread-at-noon/38002/#comment-41562892">say as much</a> the next day.That's really all I can say on the specifics, but I'd like to engage the broader--and oft-made--point of this blog's failing gender politics. 
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <br>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                In the broadest sense, I think part of this is critique--and its frequency--comes, in part, from the nature of this blog and where it lives. Unlike Fallows and Andrew, I tend to talk back in a very direct way which, I think, gives people a greater sense of ownership and community. Moreover, on the entire roster, there's only one woman, and her politics are not the sort that writers who worry about "black gender politics" would find consonant. That's not a shot at Megan. My point is that her politics, in the main, fall out the range of the people making the critique. Fallows is much more engaged with his magazine work, and Andrew still considers himself a conservative.

                                That leaves me as the closest thing to someone willing to fly the banner for Team Commie. Across the blogesphere, Team Commie is often concerned with representing for the whole coalition and making sure the voices of the feminists, the anti-racists, the Democratic Socialists etc. all have they say. The problem is this blog only represents for Team Commie by default. This is a space really has a singular purpose--helping me figure out what I really think about whatever subject is preoccupying me at the time. If that furnishes an interesting read, that's good. If it gives you ammo to shoot down your racist Facebook friends, all the better. But that isn't what gets me up in the morning.

                                To the extent that this blog delves into gender discourse--black or otherwise-- I tend to trust my natural curiosities, and passions.  So if we're talking about the Civil War and slavery, then we're going to consider <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2010/09/what-hath-ladyhood-wrought/62879/">Clara Barton</a> and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2010/07/no-power-in-the-verse-can-stop-me/60443/#disqus_thread">Sojourner Truth</a>. If we're talking about abolitionism, we're going to consider it's relationship to <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2010/08/what-hath-feminism-wrought/62289/">women's suffrage</a>. If we're talking about Frederick Douglass, we're going to consider <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2008/10/i-hope-this-is-in-good-taste/6086/">Helen Pitts</a>. If we're talking about the Confederacy we're going to consider women in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/09/compassion/63156/">Southern slave-holding families</a>.  If I'm thinking about the after-shocks I'm going to read up on <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2008/07/more-reasons-for-blacks-to-love-the-jews/4979/">Ida B Wells</a>. And <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/11/talk-to-me-like-im-stupid-sharia-law-in-the-uk/65558/">then</a> from <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/10/violence-culture-and-gender/64957/">time</a> to <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/11/talk-to-me-like-im-stupid-sharia-law-in-the-uk/65558/">time</a> we'll dig into the politics of something gender-related.

                                I leave it to black feminists to define their priorities, but this strikes me as passing the buck. James Fallows, Ezra Klein, Dahlia Lithwick, Jane Mayer and Andrew Sullivan are all thinkers of a "superb caliber." It is neither my place, nor frankly, my wish to get them to "write publicly about Black-White relations." I read their work to see them grappling with the questions that dog them at night, not the ones that dog me. And from their grappling, I take inspiration, and advice on how to proceed in my own, specific, campaign.

                                If you are truly dissatisfied with this blog's take on black gender relations, with its lack of black feminist politics, then grab a sword and make your vision manifest. It is no more important that I consider For Colored Girls high literature, then Stanley Crouch consider Illmatic high literature. Given For Colored Girls place in the canon (it's considered in the New Yorker, this week) probably less so.

                                Renina says her critique originates in the fact that I was re-reading <i>The Autobiography Of Malcolm X</i> and blogging about it, as opposed to doing the same with For Colored Girls. A considerable portion of that blogging dealt with the Autobiography's treatment on women. The critique on one side is that I was too hard on Malcolm. The critique on the other is,evidently, that I shouldn't be discussing Malcolm at all. The upshot here isn't that I don't delve into gender politics, it's that I don't do it in the way that some would like.

                                My response is simple--Do for self. To the extent that this blog has impact, I hope that it is to inspire people to go and do precisely that. My hope is not to bear your flag, but to inspire you--in the manner that I am inspired so often inspired--to bear it yourself.

                                Forgive the length of this post. I fear it communicates a level of animosity toward Renata which I do not intend. I take note of it, mostly, because I have fairly often found myself confronting this critique. I have tried to cop <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2010/05/youve-been-checking-on-my-facts/57260/">to my blind-spots</a>, and consciously work toward abolishing them. But I do not think bad impersonations of a gender studies professor is the way forward.
