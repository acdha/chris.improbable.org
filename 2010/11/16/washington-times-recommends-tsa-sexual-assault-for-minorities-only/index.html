                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                As we discussed earlier, <a href="http://www.tbd.com/blogs/amanda-hess/2010/11/the-tsa-grope-feminist-awakening-your-sex-and-gender-morning-roundup-4654.html">straight dudes across America</a> have demonstrated a renewed interest in sexual assault now that the Transportation Security Administration's "enhanced pat down" procedures threaten to subject more than just women and sexual minorities to a life of random crotch groping. The <em>Washington Times</em> editorial board has a solution to this injustice (for white people exclusively).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The piece is titled "Obama's hand in your crotch." The argument: Only racism can prevent (white) people from sexual assault at the hands of the U.S. government.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The <em>Washington Times</em> is justifiably critical of the TSA for implementing "methods that would under other circumstances constitute sexual assault" in its attempts to curb airline-based terrorist attacks. More alarming: The TSA is willing to apply these "demeaning" security measures to white people, even.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The procedures, <em>WaTi</em> argues, "are a direct result of the Obama administration's willful blindness to the threat from Islamic radicals."  Instead of focusing "on the more probable threats with minimal intrusion on those who are likely not to be terrorists," the <em>Times</em> writes, "all passengers have to pay the price by having their privacy (and their privates) invaded."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nevermind that no people—no matter how Muslim-appearing!—are "likely to be terrorists." (Terrorists make up an extremely slim contingent of all ethnic groups). The problem is that the white people are being groped along with the brown people.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even old white people. Old white people with kids who have kids . . .  white kids. The "TSA believes an 80-year-old grandmother deserves the same level of scrutiny at an airport terminal checkpoint as a 19-year-old male exchange student from Yemen," the op-ed reads. And now that the TSA has shown a willingness to subject everybody to groping, the administration threatens to disrupt a delicate social arrangement through which only racial minorities must experience indignities, and white people get to keep their shoes on at the airport.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And now for the dramatic second-person finish: "So when a TSA worker asks to examine your private parts, don't blame the terrorists, blame an administration that refuses to admit that America is at war with Islamic radicalism." Unless you happen to be a non-white person reading the <em>Washington Times</em>, in which case this "demeaning" TSA private part examination is justified by your alarming proclivity toward blowing up airplanes.
                            </p>
