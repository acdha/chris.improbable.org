                            Quite true: freezing federal pay encourages the best people to leave and completely dodges the questions of whether federal employees are cost-effective. Such a paltry excuse for leadership…

                                    Today we have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/us/politics/30freeze.html?_r=1">an announcement of a pay freeze for Federal employees</a>:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    “The hard truth is that getting this deficit under control is going to require some broad sacrifice and that sacrifice must be shared by employees of the federal government,” Mr. Obama said at a White House news conference.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    “I did not reach this decision easily,” he said. “This is not just a line item on a federal ledger. These are people’s lives.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    He called federal workers “patriots who love their country” but added that “I’m asking civil servants to do what they’ve always done” and sacrifice for the good of the nation.

                                    This <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/freeze-frame/">entirely symbolic gesture</a> has no meaningful effect on the long-term deficit problem, and will reduce demand and <a href="http://www.epi.org/quick_takes/entry/federal_worker_pay_freeze_would_weaken_a_too-weak_recovery">make the economic situation worse</a> in the short term. Federal workers must "sacrifice" because of an economic catastrophe they didn't cause, in a way that will do nothing to help the federal government or the economy. How does that work?

                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    [Democratic Senator James] Webb has pushed for a onetime windfall profits tax on Wall Street's record bonuses. He talks about the "unusual circumstances of the bailout," that the bonuses wouldn't be there without the bailout.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    "I couldn't even get a vote," Webb says. "And it wasn't because of the Republicans. I mean they obviously weren't going to vote for it. But I got so much froth from Democrats saying that any vote like that was going to screw up fundraising.

                                    Sure, Republicans would be <i>much worse</i>, but no Democratic politician should be surprised that voters won't turn out for a party like this - a President pushing Republican policies and a Democratic Congress beholden to bribes from financial corporations.
