                            Jason Cokinos never would have imagined the magic powers of a police uniform.&nbsp; Not only did it make him look dashing, but it saved him a bundle. Via <a href="http://jonathanturley.org/2010/11/18/montgomery-police-officer-given-185-ticket-after-paralyzing-14-year-old-boy/">Turley</a>:
                            <blockquote>
                                Montgomery County police officer Jason Cokinos is back walking the beat after hitting and paralyzing 14-year-old Luis Jovel Jr. Cokinos was speeding to his off-duty job when he hit Jovel and received only a $185 speeding ticket.<br>
                                <br>
                                Jovel Jr. was left a quadriplegic with permanent brain damage requiring around-the-clock medical care. The police refuse to say what discipline Cokinos received for the accident, citing state privacy laws.
                                <p>
                                    The case involved a curious legal argument. Cokinos was traveling at 56 miles an hour in a 30-mile-an-hour zone when he hit Jovel — and a police investigation found that had Cokinos not been speeding, he would not have hit Jovel.<br>
                                    <br>
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Before the punch line, note that Cokinos was off duty speeding to his second job.&nbsp; As I've noted many times in the past, the nature of police shifts means that almost every cop <a href="http://blog.simplejustice.us/2010/11/05/perfection-is-by-no-means-required.aspx">worked a second job</a>.&nbsp; Cokinos was no exception, and it provided an unanticipated benefit.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                A Montgomery County District Court judge, however, found Cokinos not guilty of negligent driving or contributing to an accident.&nbsp;<br>
                                <br>
                                The family was limited to $200,000 per case by a state law — a ridiculously low cap in such cases. They were told that they could not seek more in the case (absent a settlement) because (even though he was off-duty traveling to an off-duty job) he was in his police cruiser and wearing his uniform.<br>
                                <br>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Sweet for Cokinos.&nbsp; Less sweet for 14 year old Jovel, brain damaged, quadriplegic and incapable of paying for the care he will need for the rest of his life.<br>
                                <br>
                                Accidents happen.&nbsp; Let's supposed that Cokinos' $185 ticket was special because he's a cop.&nbsp; It could happen.&nbsp; But then, at least the kid he ran down would have redress against the negligent driver to cover the cost of his care.&nbsp; It's bad enough he's brain damaged and a quad, but does he have to be hungry too?<br>
                                <br>
                                But having been in uniform and driving a cruiser, Cokinos gets a free ride.&nbsp; What's interesting is that he wasn't serving and protecting, but driving to his private gig in public wheels.&nbsp; He didn't put on his Dairy Queen hat, but his police officer hat.&nbsp; And so he gets to speed without fear, without concern.&nbsp; Run those kids down with impunity, as long as the Chief lets you drive the cruiser to the side job.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                Lt. Paul Starks, spokesman for Montgomery police insisted that the limit on liability was appropriate because “[i]f you are in the [cruiser] you are not considered off duty.”<br>
                                <br>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                There's a solution to this problem that would likely have worked for all involved, including the people who were&nbsp;paying for the&nbsp;cruisers for cops to drive to their second jobs while speeding and running down 14 year olds.&nbsp; It would have better served all interests.&nbsp; Except Cokinos'.&nbsp;<br>
