                            No fucking shit. I've been singled out for pat-downs (serious ones, with hands on breasts and under skirts) for probably 9 out of 10 trips for the last 10 years. Everyone always just chuckles at me when I tell these stories, making jokes about big boobs and underwires, but NOW it's a huge deal apparently.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            Patricia Calhoun at Westword started reporting on women being singled out for inappropriate groping in 2001, just weeks after 9/11: <a href="http://www.westword.com/2001-10-18/news/screen-and-screen-again/">http://www.westword.com/2001-10-18/news/screen-and-screen-again/</a><br>
                            <br>
                            For the next year, I wouldn't fly in anything other than a sports bra. Then the "zealous" screeners at DIA apparently eased off. I started wearing underwires through security again, but not without trepidation.<br>
                            <br>
                            In 2003 I was almost arrested when I set off the metal detector because I was wearing a garter belt. I was pulled aside for the wand-down, which I didn't object to. I told them they'd get a small positive on the front and back of each thigh from the clips, which they did. The screener then demanded that I go to a "private screening room." "Not until my bags are done being x-rayed," I said, aware that I had a couple thousand dollars worth of technology in my carry-on. "You'll get them afterwards," they told me. I refused to go and asked for the "private screening" in view of my bags, even if that meant in view of other passengers. They threatened to arrest me. I lifted my skirt to show them the garter clips, flashing the entire terminal in the process, and the screener started to grab my arm, but the supervisor waved her off and said "let her go." I grabbed my bags off the conveyor and stalked off.<br>
                            <br>
                            I have no illusions about what would happen today.<br>
                            <br>
                            The thing is that nothing about this is new. Private citizens being arbitrarily singled out for intrusive searches and rough treatment by authority figures because of their appearance, their "attitude," or just a momentary need for an endorphin rush by a small-minded bureaucrat? Welcome to the <a href="http://9eyes.tumblr.com/photo/1280/1421482688/1/tumblr_lazkcwHY3n1qzun8o">lives of people of color</a>, the phenomenon of Driving While Black, the <a href="http://www.ihollaback.org/2009/12/amny-transit-cop-charged-with-raping-teen/">lives</a> of <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/08/ex-hunterdon_sherrifs_officer.html">women</a>, of <a href="http://www.woai.com/news/local/story/San-Antonio-police-officer-charged-with-sexually/txQtBhI-lU2lqhaBjbB9Kg.cspx">transpeople</a>, of <a href="http://www.benedictionblogson.com/2010/07/23/vancouver-police-assault-disabled-woman-in-broad-daylight/">disabled people</a> (oh hai, Canada!).<br>
                            <br>
                            It is no accident that women have been complaining about being pulled out of line because of their big breasts, having their bodies commented on by TSA officials, and getting inappropriate touching when selected for pat-downs for nearly 10 years now, but just this week it went viral. It is no accident that CAIR identified Islamic head scarves (hijab) as an automatic trigger for extra screenings in <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cair-tsa-tells-muslim-traveler-hijab-now-triggers-security-checks-80826112.html">January</a>, but just this week it went viral. What was different?<br>
                            <br>
                            <strong>Suddenly an able-bodied white man is the one who was complaining.</strong>
