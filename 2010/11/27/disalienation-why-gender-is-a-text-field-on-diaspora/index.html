                            <p>
                                A few months ago, I started contributing to the <a href="http://joindiaspora.com">Diaspora project</a>. I began by refactoring their test suite and setting up a <a href="http://ci.joindiaspora.com">continuous integration server</a>. Then I installed <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> and started mucking around with the JavaScript. That was all pretty straightforward.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A few weeks ago I made a slightly more controversial change.<br>
                                <br>
                                <a href="https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/commit/a23076387907e32215267e85c148441ff9ffc214"><img src="http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/gender-is-a-textfield1.png" alt="" title="gender-is-a-textfield" width="570" height="161"></a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The “gender” field in a person’s profile was originally a dropdown menu, with three choices: blank, male, and female. My change made it an optional text field that was blank to start. A wide open frontier! Enter anything you want.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For a while, only a few people noticed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/commit/a23076387907e32215267e85c148441ff9ffc214"><img src="http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/this-makes-me-happy.png" alt="Screenshot of a github commit comment" title="this-makes-me-happy" width="640" height="152"></a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But now that Diaspora is in <a href="http://blog.joindiaspora.com/2010/11/23/private-alpha-released.html">private alpha</a>, more people have started noticing – on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/thewavingcat/status/7734317543325696">twitter</a>, in the <a href="http://bugs.joindiaspora.com/issues/575">bug tracker</a>, and in <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/diaspora/topics/gender_choice">GetSatisfaction</a>, among other places. Some folks have asked why it’s not a dropdown with two options like everywhere else. So here’s why.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                …what else is there?
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Four years ago, at my first rails job, I worked at a company with a mostly-lesbian customer base. It turns out, in that context, knowing if someone is “male” or “female” gives you almost no useful information. The lesbian community has other widely-accepted categories of gender, but the company’s internal order tracking software — a well-known package from a national vendor — offered only male or female.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a result, the company didn’t even bother to ask for gender when users created accounts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That was my first real-life experience with the limitations of the gender binary. It was certainly interesting, but it was essentially academic. Not long after I left that job, though, one of my closest family members told me that he’s transgender. That made the whole subject <strong>way</strong> more immediate.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Now it’s personal
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                So in the last few years I’ve tried really hard to understand what being transgender means. I’ve done a lot of reading and talking and thinking about how we construct a gender identity, and how we perceive others’ gender. I’m certainly no expert, having not lived it myself. But I have discovered that my own gender identity is a bit more fluid than I thought. And perhaps most importantly, I’ve gotten comfortable with the idea of gender as an n-dimensional space, with two big clusters and a hell of a lot of outliers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then I met Sarah Dopp at <a href="http://shesgeeky.org">She’s Geeky</a>, and we talked about <a href="http://www.sarahdopp.com/blog/2008/genders-and-drop-down-menus/">dropdown menus</a>, and it all fell into place.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                tl;dr
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                I made this change to Diaspora so that I won’t alienate anyone I love before they finish signing up.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I made this change because gender is a beautiful and multifaceted thing that can’t be contained by a list.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>I know a lot of people aren’t there with me yet.</strong> So I also made this change to give them one momentary chance to consider other possibilities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I made it to start a conversation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I made it because I can.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And, of course, I made it so you can be a smartass.
                            </p>
