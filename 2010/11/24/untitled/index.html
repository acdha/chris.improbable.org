                            <b>Airmiles must win</b><br>
                            <br>
                            <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/war_room_hack_thirty/index.html">Salon</a>, the American website for people who can't quite believe that Salon is still going, is having a competition for the 30 biggest hacks in American journalism. You know who my counter is on. Remember people, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/opinion/24friedman.html?hp">this</a> is the sort of thing we're talking about:<br>
                            <br>
                            <i>For me, the most frightening news in The Times on Sunday was not about North Korea’s stepping up its nuclear program, but an article about how American kids are stepping up their use of digital devices: “Allison Miller, 14, sends and receives 27,000 texts in a month, her fingers clicking at a blistering pace [.... fade out]<br>
                            <br>
                            [....fade in] We used to have a receptionist at our office. She was replaced by a micro-chip. We got voice mail <b>TWAT!</b> [....fade out]<br>
                            <br>
                            [... fade in]We need teachers and principals who are paid better for better performance, but also valued for their long hours and dedication to students and learning. We need better parents ready to hold their kids to higher standards of academic achievement. We need better students who come to school ready to learn, not to text.[... fade out]</i>. (emphasis, word "twat" and exclamation mark added).<br>
                            <br>
                            The really annoying thing is that you know it's odds even that in six month's time he'll be writing the column about how the fuddyduddies of the education system need to get with the program and teach our kids about the reality of modern technology - we need students who come to school ready to text, like they do in Asia! Maybe he's already done that one, I'm damned if I'm checking.<br>
                            <br>
                            Seriously, this man has got to win. Thomas Friedman has been wrong about every major issue of the last fifteen years (with a partial exception for climate change, but even then he tied it to a ridiculous "geo-green" thesis). Not only wrong, but monstrously, disastrously, embarrassingly wrong. Vote for him. Vote early and vote often. I am pretty sure that you are not actually able to vote on the Salon thing, but vote anyway. Buttonhole any social acquaintances you have who might work for Salon and tell them that Friedman Must Win. If he is not declared number one on the "Hack 30", the award loses all possible credibility.<br>
                            <br>
