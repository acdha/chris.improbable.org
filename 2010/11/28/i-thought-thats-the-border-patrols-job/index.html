                            <p>
                                <strong>By Thoreau</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, the latest terrorist caught by the FBI tried to get a job (<a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/11/28/fbi/index.html">apparently on an Alaskan fishing boat</a>, difficult and dangerous, but the pay is supposed to be good) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/us/28portland.html?_r=1&amp;hp">but the FBI successfully stopped a brown guy from getting a job</a>.&nbsp; (Hence the title of the blog post.)&nbsp; Since he was on the no-fly list, he was not permitted to get on a plane to Alaska.&nbsp; The FBI then gave him cash for an apartment, and held his hand through the planning of a terrorist attack.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I know that lawyers hate it when non-lawyers offer an opinion on whether a legal term like “entrapment” should be used, so I will offer no legal opinion.&nbsp; As a moral matter, though, I will say this:&nbsp; If a troubled young man is thinking about throwing his life away by doing something awful, DO NOT STOP HIM FROM GETTING A JOB!&nbsp; It may be that he’ll merely use the money for evil, or that he’ll hate his job and become even angrier.&nbsp; But it’s also possible that he’ll find more productive outlets for his energy and attention, that he’ll enjoy some success and be less angry (I think about all of the personal resentments that I had when I was 20, and I can assure you that I was in a far more positive situation than this guy), that he’ll get some focus and discipline.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If he has to fly somewhere to do this job, and you’re worried about him getting on the plane, then tell the airline to seat Air Marshals on either side of him.&nbsp; Tell the TSA to do an extra screening and pat-down on him.&nbsp; (I oppose indiscriminate screening, and I oppose profiling, but I don’t oppose patting down a specific individual who’s published articles on jihadist websites.)&nbsp; If you don’t trust the TSA to do it right, put an undercover FBI agent in a TSA uniform and have him do the pat-down.&nbsp; Monitor all of his calls and emails before and during his time at the airport.&nbsp; Do whatever it takes to ensure that he harms nobody.&nbsp; But do not stop him from flying off to get a job.&nbsp; However expensive this closely-watched flight might be, it’s less expensive than putting a man in prison after he’s attempted to hurt people.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It may very well be that none of the FBI’s actions meet the legal definition of entrapment, but there’s nothing honorable in their actions.&nbsp; Do not stop a troubled young man from trying to get a job.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In fact, I’ll go farther:&nbsp; What if the FBI were to try, just once, going all limp-wristed the next time a troubled guy shows&nbsp; up on their radar, and instead of sending an undercover agent to groom a troubled young man for terrorism they sent a councilor, or a moderate Imam, or a good Samaritan business owner willing to give a troubled young man a job, or some other positive figure?&nbsp; Keep listening to his phone calls, keep reading his emails, keep surveilling his apartment, keep doing whatever it takes to monitor him like you would any other suspect, but have him talking to a positive figure instead of somebody who will groom him for an attack.&nbsp; Yes, this sort of intervention would be pricey, but maximum security prison isn’t cheap either.
                            </p>
