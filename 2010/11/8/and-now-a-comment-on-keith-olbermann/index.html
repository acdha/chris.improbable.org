                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                I was flying to Spain when MSNBC <a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/olbermann-suspended-from-msnbc-for-campaign-donations/">suspended</a> Keith Olbermann. And then, before I sat down to write this post, Phil Griffin, the network's president, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/08/AR2010110800504.html">announced</a> that Olbermann would be returning on Tuesday. As an MSNBC contributor who frequently appears on Olbermann's program, I was glad to miss the controversy. But it's also one that deserves comment. Not a <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16270176/">special comment</a>, maybe. But a comment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The rule Olbermann broke, put simply, is this: Employees of NBC news -- and this appears to cover MSNBC employees as well -- cannot donate to political campaigns without the express permission of their superiors. Doing so would compromise their objectivity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But would it? Consider the exemptions we know about: Joe Scarborough was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/06/us/06olbermann.html?_r=1&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=scarborough&amp;st=cse">allowed</a> to donate to the candidacy of a dear friend. Other employees seem to have been given similar license. But from the standpoint of objectivity, that seems, if anything, worse: Friendship is infinitely more harmful to objectivity than ideological affinity. My support for politicians relies on my reasoned judgments about the quality of their agendas. My support for friends rests on a far sturdier foundation. It's easy to criticize a politician. It's hard to criticize a friend.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That's not an argument against Scarborough, or even against having friends in politics. It's an argument against the particular conception of "objectivity" -- and the particular method we've chosen for its protection -- that gave rise to this rule.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Hunter S. Thompson once said that "the only thing I ever saw that came close to Objective Journalism was a closed-circuit TV setup that watched shoplifters in the General Store at Woody Creek, Colorado." So the profession has improvised: Since there aren't journalists without opinions, we went for the next best thing: journalists whose opinions weren't visible. That's where rules like the prohibition on donations come from. The problem with donations isn't that the act of donating gives you opinions. It's that it lets the audience in on opinions that already exist. But not having opinions and not admitting opinions are not the same thing. In fact, they're not even close.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When journalism admitted that the existence of opinions discredited journalists, it made it all too easy to discredit journalists. Conservative elites spent decades convincing their followers that the news media were secretly liberal. They did this largely by arguing that journalists were <em>personally</em> liberal. Liberals have, in more recent times, worked to convince their followers that the media is so afraid of being accused of liberalism that it now tilts conservative. Paid researchers for both sides trawl through the personal and public lives of reporters to find evidence of "bias." And as Facebook and OpenSecrets.org and blogs and e-mails and other forms of digital information have brought more personal information into the public sphere, their job has become easier and easier.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The problem isn't bias, however. It's "bias." Bias, according to Dictionary.com, is a tendency "that prevents unprejudiced consideration of a question." For a reporter, that would be a problem. But a donation or an opinion isn't evidence of bias. It's what normal human beings call "opinions," or even "conclusions." They're the things that come out of "unprejudiced consideration of a question," and they don't prevent you from offering the audience the evidence and information necessary to make their own unprejudiced considerations of a question.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There's nothing particularly difficult about having opinions and faithfully presenting the evidence that helped you form them: Teachers have opinions, but they often give their students the information necessary to make up their own minds. Doctors do it for their patients, workers do it for their bosses, consultants do it for their clients, the chief of staff does it for the president. In all those jobs, part of the work is to present information and options, and then part of the work is to make recommendations. But the two functions are different.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's only in journalism where the fact of having opinions supposedly undermines the ability to present information. But that's not just wrong -- it's counterproductive. One way to root out real bias is to increase the very thing that the hunt for "bias" prevents: transparency. If you know what people actually think, it's easier to tell whether they're stacking the deck to advantage their position. Conversely, if they're implying to you that they don't think anything, and then you find out that they do have opinions, you might feel betrayed -- even though there's no evidence that their work is slanted. That's the situation we often find ourselves in now.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Olbermann's case is even simpler, as he's not even supposed to be impartial: He made donations to two liberal candidates in Arizona, and then to Rand Paul's opponent. His contributions corresponded perfectly with the expressed opinions of his show. In that way, they told you something important: He believes what he's saying. These are his judgments, not his ratings strategy. If we were looking at his donations from the standpoint of transparency, we'd be comforted: There's no evidence that he's not playing straight with us.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The problem was that he broke one of his network's rules. Now the punishment is over, and a lot of people -- myself included -- will be glad to see him back on the air come Tuesday night. But it's also a good time to ask whether the rule that got everybody into this mess really makes much sense.
