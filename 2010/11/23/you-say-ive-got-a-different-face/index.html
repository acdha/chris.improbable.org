                                    If there was&nbsp;any one&nbsp;incident that could&nbsp;serve as a microcosm&nbsp;of&nbsp;our increasingly muddled, aimless and confused&nbsp;mission in Afghanistan, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/world/asia/23kabul.html?hp">this would</a> deserve&nbsp;serious consideration:&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    For months, the secret talks unfolding between Taliban and Afghan leaders to end the war appeared to be showing promise, if only because of the appearance of a certain insurgent leader at one end of the table: Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, one of the most senior commanders in the Taliban movement.
                                    <p>
                                        But now, it turns out, Mr. Mansour was apparently not Mr. Mansour at all.
                                    </p>In an episode that could have been lifted from a spy novel, United States and Afghan officials now say the Afghan man was an impostor, and high-level discussions conducted with the assistance of NATO appear to have achieved little.
                                    <p>
                                        "It's not him," said a Western diplomat in Kabul intimately involved in the discussions. "And we gave him a lot of money."

                                        Think about this for a moment: a man whose identity no one was able to verify was flown, by NATO, for face-to-face meetings with high-ranking members of the coalition (though Karzai denies having met Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, the impersonated Taliban leader in question). We don't know what his intentions were, nor do we know what information he may have stolen for whatever his ultimate goals are. We can speculate all we want about what really happened: the impostor was out to grab cash ("we gave him a lot of money," one U.S. official lamented), he was an ISI agent sent to penetrate the negotiations process, and so on. But no matter how we spin it, this is hugely embarrassing for ISAF, for the war, and for any prospects of ending it soon.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Mullah Omar, who leads one group of Taliban fighters based in Quetta, has insisted from the beginning that the [widely reported]&nbsp;talks last month were not taking place. At the time, Filkins had written that Omar was being "explicitly being cut out" of the talks. Now, it seems that is because the talks weren't really occurring. [...]
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But ISAF and Afghan officials <a>spun the talks</a>as evidence that the new, aggressive stance taken by General Petraeus, focused on killing mid-level commanders to â€˜force' the Taliban to the negotiating table, was working. They were partially right: something had changed. But it wasn't the effectiveness of their tactics or strategy. Instead, this episode confirms what many Afghanistan watchers have long feared: the leadership of ISAF doesn't seem to have any idea what it's doing, who it's talking to, and (probably) who it is really killing.

                                    There has been a <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/29/petraeus_versus_obama">concerted effort</a> of late&nbsp;to shift the narrative on the Afghanistan war from quagmire to discernible progress, from stalemate to progress, and this PR campaign is in the service of extending the war indefinitely (with some factions&nbsp;attempting to push&nbsp;the&nbsp;aspirational date to commence withdrawal from 2011&nbsp;to 2014).&nbsp; Alex&nbsp;Strick van Lischoten <a href="http://www.currentintelligence.net/afghanwire/2010/11/22/five-things-david-petraeus-wants-you-to-believe.html">points out</a>, however, that there is little empirical basis to justify this optimism and, in some cases, the assertions seem little more than wishful thinking and self-delusion masquerading as fact.&nbsp;
