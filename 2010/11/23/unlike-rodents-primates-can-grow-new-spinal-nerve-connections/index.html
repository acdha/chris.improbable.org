                            <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/11/unlike-rodents-primates-can-grow-new-spinal-nerve-connections.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss"><img vspace="4" hspace="4" border="0" align="right" width="230" height="129" src="http://static.arstechnica.net/brief_icons/science-brief.png"></a>
                            <p>
                                In Madeline L'Engle’s fictional work <em>The Arm of the Starfish</em>, Calvin O’Keefe discovered a way to help mammals regenerate tissue the way starfish do. Nonfictional research has not gotten quite that far, but it might not have to. A new paper has found that rhesus macaques can spontaneously reform connections among their spinal neurons following injury.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It has been known for some time that the mammalian spinal cord can extensively recover from partial, but not complete, injury. Although the general consensus has been that the axonal projections, which connect the neurons of the spinal cord, did not have the plasticity required to recover after injury, our heroes (the authors) thought otherwise and set out to test it. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To do so, they gave what's called C7 lateral hemisection lesions to 5-8 year old rhesus monkeys (<em>Macaca mulatta</em>), which involves severing one side of the spinal cord. They then examined structural, elecrophysiological, and functional responses to the lesion at either two weeks or 4-8 months later. They focused on the corticospinal projections, which primates use for many features of fine voluntary movement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All hemisected subjects initially displayed complete disruption of motor connections projecting through the right side of the spinal cord. Fine motor control, as assayed by the ability to reach for a food reward with the right hand, had started to recover at 4 weeks post-lesion and reached a plateau at 12-16 weeks post-lesion. Other functions in the right forelimb and hindlimb also recovered at this time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Two weeks after C7 hemisection, the number of corticospinal axons below the lesion site was reduced to 26 ±4 percent of that in control monkeys. The axons that were left came from  projections that descended on the opposite side, and then crossed the spinal cord midline. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By 24 weeks post-hemisection, though, the injured monkeys had 60 ±9 percent of the corticospinal connections as their intact counterparts—a spontaneous 2.3 fold increase. But these didn't represent entirely new axons.  The researchers showed that axons that had crossed the midline before the injury had sprouted more branches, and that these formed the additional connections
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although the injured monkeys had fewer axons, analysis of their topographical distribution in gray matter indicated that they were qualitatively the same as those in uninjured monkeys. Principal components analysis showed that the functional improvement of the forelimb was significantly associated with the sprouting of these corticospinal axons.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The authors point out that although we frequently use rodents to model spinal cord injuries, this sort of spontaneous recovery is not observed in their corticospinal axons. This is probably due to the different organization at play in primates; rodents have few corticospinal axons that cross the spinal cord to begin with, so there's little there to drive the recovery. Thus, rodents might not be the best models for humans with spinal cord injuries. At the very least, if rodents are used, more of their limited corticospinal neurons should be left in place to better mimic the situation in humans. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This spontaneous sprouting of these corticospinal neurons after injury might be a potential therapeutic target; if we can figure out how to enhance it, that might help people recover from partial spinal injury.
