                                    Like many people, I played the New York Times' <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/13/weekinreview/deficits-graphic.html?src=me&amp;ref=general">You Fix the Budget</a> puzzle. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/11/13/weekinreview/deficits-graphic.html?choices=4mt245qv">My personal solution</a> can be succinctly described as "stop war; tax the rich".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Of course, the whole game is based on assumptions about what we can or can't do: there are options for "Obama's plan" versus "Clinton-era taxes", for instance, but none for my favored <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2010_09/025679.php">Eisenhower-era taxes</a>. And then we also get to consider:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    Tighten eligibility for disability
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    The costs of the disability insurance program, which is administrated by the Social Security Administration, have been rising rapidly. This option would cut disability spending by 5 percent by focusing on states with the loosest standards. Supporters note that growing numbers of workers are classified as disabled, though the average job is less physically taxing. Opponents worry that injured or ill workers with few good job prospects would be harmed.But hey! It could save up to $17 billion dollars! Out of a trillion! So really, how much could it hurt?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It happens that I've spent some time this past week finding resources for a friend who IMHO needs to go on disability, and from my personal observation: it could hurt a *lot*. And the people it would hurt are, pretty much by definition, already hurting -- it is a targeted intervention to afflict the afflicted.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Most people who file for disability are <a href="http://www.nosscr.org/faq.html#15">turned down the first time</a>. Usually, the process is to have your claim "reconsidered" -- which means "denied again." Only after that are you entitled to go on to judicial review, where you have a pretty good chance of getting your disability recognized -- about a year and half after you started the process.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So imagine my friend. She was working a few blocks from the World Trade Center on 9/11/01. She remembers:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    You've seen the pictures of the people just walking, completely covered in gray ash, not a clean, bare piece of flesh or clothing in sight? That's exactly what we looked like. It was so incredibly eerie - this long line of THOUSANDS of people, walking to and over the Manhattan Bridge in COMPLETE SILENCE. Which might not seem like too much, but NYC is NEVER silent, there's always SOMEONE talking. No one, not one single person was saying a word. We just kept walking.
                                </blockquote>She went back to work as soon as possible, and kept working. And then in 2006 she was diagnosed with cancer. She kept working after the mastectomy, and she kept working nearly full-time during chemotherapy -- because, after all, she couldn't afford to take time off, much less quit, or she wouldn't even be able to stay in her cramped apartment way out in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn.
                                <p>
                                    And now even though the cancer is in remission -- which only means constant worry that it will come back, of course -- she's developed severe osteoarthritis of the spine, probably as a side effect of a very pricey new drug that kept her alive during chemo. I'd invite you to imagine how painful that is, except you probably *can't*. So of course she lost her job last spring, due to "absenteeism" (like, say, trips to the emergency room, or hospital stays for pneumonia). But don't worry, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704506404575592644050046172.html">Wall Street bonuses will be up 5% this year</a>! For the very serious, hard-working people who *deserve* them, of course.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So for six months my friend has been looking for work (you can't collect Unemployment unless you're trying, of course) while suffering debilitating pain and anxiety. Now that's running out, and she <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/house-republicans-block-unemployment-benefits-extension/?scp=1&amp;sq=unemployment%20extension&amp;st=cse">probably won't get an extension</a> -- Unemployment is just coddling lazy people, after all -- and so I'm trying to help her, and to persuade her that she needs and deserves help. I have no particular knowledge of NYC social services or disability or anything, really -- but I have <a href="http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory-written-by-christine-miserandino/">more spoons</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So when the Very, Very Serious Andrew Biggs (of the very Galtian American Enterprise Institute) talks about how we have to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/11/14/16-ways-to-cut-the-deficit/the-disability-insurance-monster">tighten the loose eligibility standards on the Disability Insurance Monster</a>[1], I want to tell him where he can put the apparently infinite supply of silver spoons with which he's been gifted. Every time anyone says they want to "tighten eligibility" for any social welfare program, what they mean in practice is that people who really need help will be *more* stressed, *more* humiliated, and in more pain than they already are. But I guess the time, effort, suffering and spoons of people who need help don't count as "program costs", so increasing them counts as a win.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Obviously, the <a href="http://www.nosscr.org/faq.html#24">National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives</a> is not a completely disinterested party, but I have to agree with their assessment of "Why does Social Security turn down so many claims for disability benefits?":
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    One reason is that there is no simple way to determine whether an individual is disabled. Most people who are disabled suffer from pain. There is no way of determining whether or not another individual is in pain, much less how much pain they are in. A second reason is that Social Security over the years has been more concerned with making sure that everyone who is receiving Social Security disability benefits is "truly" disabled than with making sure that everyone who is disabled receives Social Security disability benefits. An underlying reason is that Congress has always believed that, given a chance, many people will "fake" disability in order to get benefits.
                                </blockquote>If you ask me, one reason more people are getting disability payments these days is because they aren't dead. It wouldn't have taken much more to have killed my friend in the past 10 years, and then our self-satisfied free-market overlords wouldn't have to worry about long-term disability payments for her.
                                <p>
                                    Well, they can just [do something physically impossible with] that noise. But speaking of shame and humiliation, I am ashamed that our society apparently thinks people like Biggs are respectable and serious, and should be proposing the rules that will let my friend live -- or not.<br>
