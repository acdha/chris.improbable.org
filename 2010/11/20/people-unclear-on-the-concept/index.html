                                Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson is good on a lot of issues, but his belief that the privatization fairy will necessarily grant our wish for <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/11/19/why-do-we-have-a-tsa/">kinder, gentler airport security</a> is childlike in its naivete. It’s even shockingly behind the best recent right-wing/libertarian thinking on privatization of government services.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Johnson offers a simplistic account of the differing incentives between a government-run TSA and a privately contracted airport security regime, in which
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    The airlines, however, who after all own the airplanes and are ultimately responsible for their passengers’ safety and comfort, have every reason in the world to care about security — and providing it in ways that are acceptable to their paying customers.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If allowed to take the responsibility for airport screening, airlines would turn to the best and brightest minds and entrepreneurs on the planet to develop technology and best practices that would certainly be more effective than whatever the government is doing now — and financial necessity would ensure that those procedures did not constitute abuse and unacceptable invasions of our privacy and our bodies.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Certainly, like many other aspects of our lives and businesses, the government may be compelled to establish minimum standards and criteria for airport security; however, let entrepreneurs and the marketplace figure out how to meet those standards — rather than bureaucrats. The result, I am absolutely confident, will be safer air travel, more efficient airports, lower costs, and a lot less officially-sanctioned touching.
                                </p>

                                Johnson doesn’t seem to get that his benign scenario is just one possible equilibrium outcome of a privatization plan. He’s not thinking very clearly about who the real customers of the security contractors would be – answer: not travelers – and what that means for how security contractors would conduct themselves. (Answer: no first-order incentive to treat passengers well.) He’s not recognizing that the details of those “minimum standards and criteria for airport security” house a pretty big devil: once again, passenger convenience will not be a first-order concern, and ordinary travelers will have little influence on their shape. And he seems to imagine that airlines are the same sort of economic actor as the local coffee shop in an Econ 101 text, when airlines have long been “strategic industries” enmeshed in a web of government support and airline rent-seeking. He doesn’t find any conclusions worth drawing from how the airlines treat passengers today in spheres they do control for how they might treat passengers tomorrow when they become responsible again for airport security.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the one side, Johnson imagines an airline concern for passenger comfort and dignity that they do not currently demonstrate and would have no strong incentive to express in the security area. On the other, he imagines an airline incentive to “care about security” that they don’t really have. Consider a news story from exactly a month ago, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/nyregion/21bavis.html">by Colin Moynihan in the New York Times</a>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Eight months from now, the family of Mark Bavis will get what they have wanted since he died on Sept. 11, 2001: their day in court.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    …
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Most of the legal claims by people injured or killed in the attacks have been resolved. Thousands of victims and families were paid more than $7 billion from the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund with the stipulation that they would forgo lawsuits. Others declined and filed suits that have been settled over time for about $500 million.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    When the Bavis trial begins, it is expected to be the only open Sept. 11 lawsuit. Court approval is likely soon in the settlement of a case involving Louis Mariani, who was also on Flight 175.
                                </p>

                                In other words, so far, taxpayers* have spent 14 times as much on victim compensation for the attacks of September 11, 2001 as airlines have spent. The government passed laws <a href="http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/defenseandsecurity/a/randon911.htm">limiting the liability of the airlines for damages</a> from the atrocity. And as an additional fun fact, the victim compensation fund provided <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ042.107">billions of dollars in compensation to the airlines themselves</a>. And Gary Johnson believes the only perverse incentive at work here is that “the TSA doesn’t seem to answer to anyone.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If all we do is “privatize” the TSA, we’ll still have:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                * government-set “security” mandates<br>
                                * gigantic airlines who rival the financial industry when it comes to government favoritism<br>
                                * “security” companies and personnel whose customers are <em>not</em> airline passengers<br>
                                * a manic “security” culture in the country at large
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Johnson also hasn’t drawn lessons from the political power of the “security” industries themselves, from the “prison-industrial complex” to law-enforcement unions to Private Military Contractors and other “defense” firms.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I thought in 2001 and still think that federalizing airport security was a “mistake.” (Where “mistake” means the sort of willful folly governments undertake to be seen <em>doing something</em> while simultaneously enhancing their own power.) I think the TSA is a travesty, and current airport-security policies make me much less interested in flying anywhere. I think those policies are symptom and cause, in a feedback loop, of national degeneration: ways the country is becoming pathetic and ridiculous. But imagining that all we have to do is let privatization unleash “the best and brightest minds and entrepreneurs on the planet” is pathetic and ridiculous in its own way. What we need are a citizenry and ruling elite with a less toxic combination of cowardice and viciousness than we’ve developed in the last decade. Unless Gary Johnson knows some waste-disposal contractors that would clean up our national moral brownfields for a fee, privatization is at best a side issue.
