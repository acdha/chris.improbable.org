                        <blockquote>
                            Apparently <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20101119/10225611947/tsa-agents-absolutely-hate-new-pat-downs-find-them-disgusting-morale-breaking.shtml">TSA agents don't like the new pat-down rules either</a>. Here are a few responses from blogger Steven Frischling's <a href="http://boardingarea.com/blogs/flyingwithfish/2010/11/18/tsa-enhanced-pat-downs-the-screeners-point-of-view/">unscientific survey of 20 TSA Transportation Security Officers</a>, highlighting the demoralizing nature of having to spend eight hours a day at work either browbeating passengers into being photographed naked or sexually assaulting them under colour of executive-branch fiat:
                            <blockquote>
                                It is not comfortable to come to work knowing full well that my hands will be feeling another man’s private parts, their butt, their inner thigh. Even worse is having to try and feel inside the flab rolls of obese passengers and we seem to get a lot of obese passengers!
                            </blockquote>
                            <blockquote>
                                Molester, pervert, disgusting, an embarrassment, creep. These are all words I have heard today at work describing me, said in my presence as I patted passengers down. These comments are painful and demoralizing, one day is bad enough, but I have to come back tomorrow, the next day and the day after that to keep hearing these comments. If something doesn’t change in the next two weeks I don’t know how much longer I can withstand this taunting. I go home and I cry. I am serving my country, I should not have to go home and cry after a day of honorably serving my country.
                            </blockquote>
                            <blockquote>
                                I come to work to do my job. It is not up to me to decide policy, it is up to me to carry out my duties as dictated by the Transportation Security Administration. When a person stands in front of me and calls me a pervert or accuses me of molesting them it is disheartening. People fail to understand that neither of us are happy about the intrusive pat down I am carrying out. I am polite, I am professional and while someone may not like what I have to carry out, they came to me because they choose not to utilize the alternative and less invasive method of security at my airport.
                            </blockquote>
                            <blockquote>
                                I served a tour in Afghanistan followed by a tour in Iraq. I have been hardened by war and in the past week I am slowly being broken by the constant diatribe of hateful comments being lobbed at me. While many just see a uniform with gloves feeling them for concealed items I am a person, I am a person who has feelings. I am a person who has served this country. I am a person who wants to continue serving his country. The constant run of hateful comments while I perform my job will break me down faster and harder than anything I encountered while in combat in the Army.
                            </blockquote>To all the TSOs who echo these complaints, this image is for you (click to embiggen):<br>

                            Do you know what that is? That is an 800-nanometer-long carbon nanotube, vibrating at 140 MHz. In other words, it is <em>the world's smallest violin, playing just for you</em>.<br>
                            <br>
                            News flash: Passengers criticize what you do as disgusting, embarrassing and creepy because <em>what you are doing is disgusting, embarrassing and creepy</em>. Clearly at least some of you agree, as long as the passenger is a fatty or someone of your same gender. (I won't delve into the blatant fat-phobia and homophobia inherent in that first quote up there, as I expect the rest of the blogosphere will shred it better than I can, but it's worth pointing out.) If the fact that you have to go to work every day and digitally rape passengers who object to it makes you upset, then the right thing to do is <strong>quit</strong>.<br>
                            <br>
                            This is, of course, the natural point where someone pipes up and says "But what about all the TSA employees with families, children, car loans, mortgages, medical bills? They're in such a catch-22!" To which I say, that is a crock of shit and you know it. Anyone who has ever been in a position where they had to make an ethical decision about <em>any</em> job knows exactly what I mean. If you are an ethical person, and your boss orders you to do an unethical thing, either you refuse the order or you quit. Doctors: would you follow your boss' orders if he told you to test non-FDA-approved medications on your patients? Construction workers: would you follow your boss' orders if she told you to use concrete or rebar that was too thin for the job? Chemical engineers: would you follow your boss' orders if he told you to fake the results of an emissions study? If not, then why would you defend TSOs who regularly violate the 4th Amendment and commit sexual assault in the course of carrying out their assigned job duties?<br>
                            <br>
                            "But they're just doing what they're told," I hear others whine. That doesn't cut it either. There are thousands of people in America who commit crimes as part of their job description every day: leg-breakers, drug mules, pimps, spammers. We have a word to describe these people: <strong>criminals</strong>. The only things separating a TSO from a serial rapist are the paycheck and the rapidly-fraying flag the TSOs wrap themselves in. If you're not comfortable with your five-year-old son knowing what you do at work every day, <em>find a different job</em>.<br>
                            <br>
                            Ethical people understand that sometimes, being an ethical person means not taking the path of least resistance. Quitting a job is frightening, especially in this economy. That said, unemployment eligibility policies are on your side if you quit a job due to <em>good cause attributable to the employer</em>. Here's what the state of Connecticut <a href="http://www.ctdol.state.ct.us/progsupt/unemplt/claimant-guide/allowable.htm">has to say about that</a>:
                            <blockquote>
                                For good cause to be attributable to the employer, it must somehow relate to the wages, hours or working conditions of the job you voluntarily left. A change in conditions created by your employer or a breach of your employment agreement which is substantial and adversely affects you might be good cause for leaving attributable to the employer. In addition, good cause attributable to the employer may exist if the job itself adversely affects your health or aggravates or worsens a medical condition.
                            </blockquote>The recent changes in TSA policy are unequivocably a change in working conditions created by the employer, they are substantial, and clearly they're affecting TSOs adversely. Being on unemployment sucks, particularly in terms of the take-home, but it is a helping hand, if only a small one, toward finding a career that doesn't demean you and force you to assault people.<br>
                            <br>
                            Here's another thing I'd like to see, though I have no idea where to start with it: a corporate-America-sponsored TSA Amnesty Program. Get a bunch of recruiters together to find businesses, both small and large, that are willing to hire ex-TSOs, and match them up with TSOs who are ready to jump ship but don't have the financial stability to do so. According to Newsweek, <a href="http://current.newsweek.com/budgettravel/2008/02/security_is_job_turnover_high.html">TSA job turnover is between 20 and 26 percent</a>. Congress has mandated 43,000 screeners. Given that <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">non-farm employment increased by 151,000 jobs during the month of October and this did not change the unemployment rate by even a tenth of a percent</a>, with a coordinated effort we could easily find new jobs for half the TSOs by the end of this year. Anyone know any recruiters who might be interested in making some money off of civil disobedience?<br>
                            <br>
                            The message we need to send to the TSA is clear: its policies are harmful and wrong, both for passengers and its employees, and neither passengers nor employees will stand for it. TSA screeners who have the courage to quit their jobs in the face of these new regulations are on the side of justice, and the flying community ought to band together to support them. Who wants to help me figure out how to do that?
