                            <p>
                                Apple <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/11/airprint-wont-print-to-shared-printers-out-of-the-box.ars">removed support</a>&nbsp;in Mac OS X 10.6.5 for printing from iOS devices to shared printers at the last minute. This made AirPrint a less appealing feature for many users, since it is now apparently limited to certain HP printer models. Developer Steven Troughton-Smith found the configuration files necessary to <a href="http://blog.steventroughtonsmith.com/2010/11/return-airprint-sharing-to-mac-os-x.html">reenable that support</a>, though, and in the process discovered the mechanism that makes AirPrint discovery work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When Apple <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/09/ios-42-will-give-all-ios-devices-wireless-printing-in-november.ars">announced</a> that AirPrint was coming to iOS 4.2, it said that the feature would initially work with select HP printer models that supported HP's "ePrint" remote printing feature. However, the company also said that shared printers connected to a Mac or Windows PC would also work with AirPrint.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Developers then discovered that the final release build of Mac OS X 10.6.5 didn't have support for AirPrint printing to shared printers. Apple also removed references to the shared printer support from its website.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Stranger still, developers that had previously installed test builds of 10.6.5 found that installing the final release build didn't disable shared printer support. This oddity got Troughton-Smith wondering if it was simply configuration files or hidden settings that enabled the feature.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "My shared printer support wasn't removed when I upgraded to the final 10.6.5 on my machine from an earlier version," Troughton-Smith told Ars. "That's what kick-started my investigation."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Troughton-Smith worked with another developer that had a clean install of 10.6.5, an install that didn't support AirPrint. The pair used a tool called <a href="http://www.tildesoft.com/">Bonjour Browser</a> to look for differences between the services broadcast by both systems over mDNS. (Bonjour is Apple's <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/05/02/18/apple_to_rename_rendezvous_technology_bonjour.html">name</a> for the mDNS discovery service, also known as Zeroconf.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The key discovery involves a format called URF. "The AirPrint shared printer had an <code>URF</code> tag, and <code>image/urf</code> as a mime-type for the printer," Troughton-Smith said. "The other did not."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Searching for "URF" in the files of an earlier test build of 10.6.5 turned up three files which enable shared printer support. Two are configuration files that broadcast the URF tag and mime-type over mDNS. The other is a filter that takes URF input and coverts it to PDF for printing via the CUPS print service. Adding these three files to a system with Mac OS X 10.6.5, and then deleting and adding any printers, will enable those printers to work with AirPrint.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For shared printer support to work, then, the mDNS service needs to broadcast that a printer supports URF, and—since AirPrint devices don't have print drivers or other software—the printing subsystem needs to handle filtering that format and sending it to the shared printer. The process can even be configured to <a href="http://www.rho.cc/index.php/linux2/48-misc/104-printing-from-ipad-airprint-via-cups">work on Linux</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Right now, the only way to make it work on Mac OS X is to use copies of the three files from 10.6.5 test builds, but that is a legally dubious proposition. "The two other options are to write our own URF to PDF filter, or write our own server app that does all the work in the background," Troughton-Smith said.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For instance, a savvy IT admin might be able to write such a tool himself, or install a tool written by someone else, to enable AirPrint support for his office.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Troughton-Smith said that he wasn't entirely sure what the URF format is, but believes it's related to a format called UNIRAST. He suggested that supporting URF is related to HP's ePrint service, which AirPrint is <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/11/10/inside_airprint_apples_printing_system_for_ios.html">likely built around</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The reason why Apple pulled the shared printer support at the last minute is still unknown. Speculation abounds that a patent troll has threatened Apple with a lawsuit. Whatever the cause, many developers believe Apple will sort out the issue in due time. "If I'd written it, as a developer I'd be kinda bummed that a legal issue killed the feature," Troughton-Smith said.
