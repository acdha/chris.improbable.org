                        <blockquote>
                            A DNA test has proven that a man <a href="http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/texas-observer-exclusive-dna-tests-undermine-evidence-in-texas-execution">was executed for murder by the State of Texas on the basis of false forensic evidence</a>.<br>
                            <br>
                            From <i><a href="http://www.texasobserver.org/cover-story/texas-observer-exclusive-dna-tests-undermine-evidence-in-texas-execution">The Texas Observer</a></i>:
                            <blockquote>
                                <i>Claude Jones always claimed that he wasn't the man who walked into an East Texas liquor store in 1989 and shot the owner. He professed his innocence right up until the moment he was strapped to a gurney in the Texas execution chamber and put to death on December 7, 2000. His murder conviction was based on a single piece of forensic evidence recovered from the crime scene—a strand of hair—that prosecutors claimed belonged to Jones.<br>
                                <br>
                                But DNA tests completed this week at the request of the</i> Observer <i>and the New York-based <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/claudejones">Innocence Project</a> show the hair didn't belong to Jones after all.</i>
                            </blockquote>From the <a href="http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/DNA_Test_Proves_Critical_Hair_Evidence_in_a_Capital_Murder_Case_Didnt_Match_Man_Executed.php">Innocence Project press release</a>:
                            <blockquote>
                                [Texas governor at the time] <i>George Bush, who was awaiting a decision from the Florida Supreme Court on whether the presidential election recount would continue, denied Jones' request for a 30 day stay of execution to do DNA test on the hair sample. The memo from the General Counsel's office that recommended against the stay did not tell Bush that Jones was seeking a DNA test of the hair. Evidence that the hair "matched" Jones was critical to the prosecution's case at trial and proved to be the key factor in a narrow 3-2 decision by the Texas Court of Appeals finding there was sufficient corroboration of the accomplice who testified against Jones to uphold the murder conviction.<br>
                                <br>
                                "I have no doubt that if President Bush had known about the request to do a DNA test of the hair he would have would have issued a 30-day stay in this case and Jones would not have been executed," said Barry C. Scheck, Co-Founder and Co-Director of the Innocence Project, which is affiliated with Cardozo School of Law.</i>
                            </blockquote>San Jacinto County district attorney Bill Burnett was an assistant prosecutor on Claude Jones's case and later, as DA, attempted to have the hair strand evidence destroyed rather than allow testing. Under Texas law, he said, the only person who could request a DNA test was the imprisoned inmate. In this case, the inmate was already dead.<br>
                            <br>
                            Burnett did not live to see the hair tested. He died of pancreatic cancer earlier this year just days before a judge ruled that the evidence had to be handed over to an independent forensics laboratory.<br>
                            <br>
                            The DNA test results do not prove that Claude Jones was innocent of murder. They do show that Claude Jones' conviction and eventual execution were based on demonstrably false evidence.<br>
                            <br>
                            Dave Mann of <i>The Texas Observer</i> will be talking about the DNA test news on KUT 90.5 FM from Austin, Texas at 4:44 pm CST. <a href="http://www.kut.org/togo/listen">You can listen online</a>.<br>
