                                <b>How It Began</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It began in 1997. &nbsp;There had been a rash of arsons of black churches in the deep South. &nbsp;People of faith across the U.S. began to say "something must be done--what can I do?" to help rebuild these churches and their faith communities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <div>
                                I came of age in the 60's--a time of racial strife in America. &nbsp;I was in college when some of the worst was occurring. &nbsp;Freedom rides. &nbsp;Murders of demonstrators and activists. &nbsp;Voting rights marches and a firebombing of one of the local leaders. &nbsp;A call for people to come to the South, to show their support for civil rights, to act in solidarity with African-Americans. &nbsp;I felt called, but I didn't have the courage to follow the call.
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <br>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                I was living in the Philadelphia area in the 90's, member of a Quaker meeting. &nbsp;One Sunday, a Friend rose and announced a group was forming to spend a week helping rebuild a burned out church in the South. &nbsp;I felt called. &nbsp;And this time, I answered the call.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A group eventually formed, led by Lance and Mary. &nbsp;Lance is a very devout, activist Jew. &nbsp;His wife, Mary, is a devout activist Roman Catholic. &nbsp;They sought an ecumenical, interracial group to help rebuild a burned-out church. &nbsp;Neither was experienced in construction (though Lance is an architect.) &nbsp;But they assembled a group of 28 people--12 Jews, 12 Catholics, 2 Quakers, 1 Presbyterian, and 1 secular humanist--committed to spending a week together building.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our assignment was to go to Macomb, Mississippi and assist with the rebuilding of Rocky Point Missionary Baptist Church. &nbsp;The church had been burned down in 1996 on the anniversary of Martin Luther King's assassination. Two local teen-agers (both white) were arrested, convicted and in prison for the crime. &nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We arrived in Macomb in July, 1997. &nbsp;The J. J. White Presbyterian church had kindly offered their building for our living and eating. &nbsp;Their floor, bathrooms and kitchen provided a welcome home for us. &nbsp;And every day, at the end of work, we would return to the church to find 4-5 homemade cakes or pies waiting for us. &nbsp; Because workers need to have something good to eat, they said. &nbsp;There was at least one pecan pie each day--the women of the church were competing. &nbsp;And everything was always immediately consumed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We worked five days in mid-July Mississippi heat and humidity (90's and 90's.) &nbsp;My task quickly became painting the ceiling. &nbsp;(I was the only one comfortable going up on 3-level scaffolding to roll endlessly the wood ceiling.) &nbsp;The temperature up there was certainly well into the 100's. &nbsp;I would go up, paint what I could reach, come down, consume a can or bottle of something, and return. &nbsp;And I loved it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Eventually, even standing on the top of the scaffolding and reaching with an extension pole, I couldn't <u>quite</u>&nbsp;reach the peak. &nbsp;So a couple of guys built a little enclosure for me. &nbsp;It wouldn't stop me from falling, but it gave me the psychological confidence I needed to be able to stand on tiptoes, reach with a fully extended roller and pole, and finish the peak of the ceiling.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our evenings included visiting with the victim of the 1963 firebombing, having Bible study with a local church, attending a local revival, being interviewed on the local radio station. &nbsp;Each time, the question was always "why are you here?" &nbsp;And our answer was "to help you rebuild your community."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It rained our last afternoon. &nbsp;We gathered under a sheltering tree, and the minister's daughter sang "Amazing Grace." &nbsp;It has always been one of my favorite hymns. &nbsp;But I never felt its power as much as I did with her incredible voice, singing only as an African-American woman can sing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Within hours after our time ended, I thought "I must do this again." &nbsp;And so did others. &nbsp;So each year, a similar group organized for a similar project. &nbsp;We decided to broaden our geography and went to El Salvador in 1999, again in 2001, and again in 2003. &nbsp;But we also knew there was work to be done in Philadelphia. &nbsp;So we organized similar work projects in Philadelphia in 1998, 2000 and 2002.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I discovered the Habitat for Humanity Global Village program in 2003. &nbsp;I had previously done some work locally with Habitat. &nbsp;I liked the work and liked their model. &nbsp;And having a passion travel, and for meeting people of other cultures in their own places, I signed on. &nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My first GV trip was to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. &nbsp;It was there I discovered internet cafes and began e-mailing back to my family which my wife shared with others. &nbsp;Since then, I've taken trips to more than a dozen places, and each time, I've shared my experiences with family and friends.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am now going to post these e-mails. &nbsp;Unedited, exactly as I wrote them over the years. &nbsp;I do so in the hope that others will discover the joy of travel and service and will become as addicted to it as I am.
