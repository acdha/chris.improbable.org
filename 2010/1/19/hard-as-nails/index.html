But it turned out that the pain was entirely psychological, as the nail had missed his foot by sliding between his toes.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>

                                    A builder aged 29 came to the accident and emergency department having jumped down on to a 15 cm nail. As the smallest movement of the nail was painful he was sedated with fentanyl and midazolam. The nail was then pulled out from below. When his boot was removed a miraculous cure appeared to have taken place. Despite entering proximal to the steel toecap the nail had penetrated between the toes: the foot was entirely uninjured.<br>

                                As Tom mentioned "One of the things I love about it is that the builder had no incentive to 'fake'. He knew he should have acted tough so we know that the pain he felt wasn't over-acting. It was imaginary pain, but it was real imaginary pain!"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This isn't really the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo">nocebo effect</a>, where 'side-effects' appear after having taken nothing but a placebo, but more similar to what doctors might describe in its persistent form as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatization_disorder">somatisation disorder</a> where physical symptoms appear that aren't explained by tissue damage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, both are similar in that real pain arises from beliefs, expectations and perceptions. We now know that all pain has a significant mental component and, consequently, psychological therapy is an <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19370592">effective</a> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19370688">treatment</a> for chronic pain.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's no coincidence that Tom picked up this snippet in a talk by psychologist <a href="http://bham.academia.edu/StuartDerbyshire">Stuart Derbyshire</a> who has done some fantastic <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;orig_db=PubMed&amp;term=derbyshire%20s%20%5Bau%5D%20hypnot*&amp;cmd=search">studies</a> on the neural basis of psychologically controlled and induced pain by using hypnosis in fMRI scanners.
