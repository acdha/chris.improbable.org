                                    Kelly Glossip and Dennis Engelhard
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Missouri Highway Patrol trooper Cpl. Dennis Engelhard was <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/15E011ABF8AC552D86257698000B8679">killed on Christmas day</a> in the line of duty.&nbsp; He was struck by an out-of-control SUV on the side of the Interstate 44 while assisting at the scene of an accident.&nbsp; Engelhard’s same-sex partner of nearly 15 years, Kelly Glossip, will receive Engelhard’s retirement benefits as a surviving spouse.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Wait, sorry, no – Missouri has enshrined DOMA as both a state law and an amendment to the state constitution.&nbsp; Glossip and Engelhard were never permitted to marry.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.fox2now.com/news/ktvi-trooper-denied-benefits-012810,0,2621553.story">Glossip won’t get any of the state benefits owed to the spouse of a fallen trooper</a>.&nbsp; Engelhard’s parents have given some financial help to their late son’s partner, but Glossip is worried about losing the house they owned together.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At this point, foes of equality like to jump in and say, “Aha!&nbsp; Gay marriage is really just a scam to get benefits!&nbsp; All they care about is money!”&nbsp; Others might take a moment to acknowledge the tragic loss, but then ask, “What’s wrong with Glossip?&nbsp; Can’t he support himself?’”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And when I hear that, I wonder, <em>Don’t these ‘defenders of marriage’ understand marriage at all?</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Marriage is about two individuals building a life together.&nbsp; For 15 years, Engelhard and Glossip did just that.&nbsp; Day by day, they built a world where they needed each other profoundly, both materially and emotionally, just as straights in a strong marriage need each other.&nbsp; And Glossip is struggling now, just a straight person would struggle at the loss of a spouse.&nbsp; That’s the nature of the relationship.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is what our opponents don’t understand (and some absolutely <em>refuse</em> to understand):&nbsp; Our bonds, our relationships, our lives – they’re not fundamentally different from theirs.&nbsp; <em>Of course</em> Glossip is worried about losing their house.&nbsp; He and Engelhard weren’t just roommates or buddies or BFFs.&nbsp; They were long-term partners who established a life together.&nbsp; Lord, what an awkward way to put it.&nbsp; Try this:&nbsp; They were <em><strong>married</strong></em>.&nbsp; Even if the state didn’t recognize it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, the news article has drawn a number of <a href="http://www.topix.net/forum/source/fox2now/T32R9Q1GJ5KSEKMC7">comments</a>.&nbsp; Most are recognizably human, but some…

                                    the killed patrol man should of made this person his benefactor in everyway he could. It was his responsiblity to provide not the other way around. If his job stated a legal marriage for retirement benefits for a spouse then he should of worked in some other field or acted in changing the requirements.

                                    Reading that paragraph of brokeback drama made me want to puke. Is the “partner” uncapable of working and paying bills so he can keep his car and pay rent somewhere ? He makes it sound as if he’s just thown out into the streets now. C’mon, is this a joke ?

                                You’re right about one thing, Maggie.&nbsp; We do have rage.&nbsp; But we do pay a price.&nbsp; We pay a price for the bullies and meanness you represent, and we pay it everyday.&nbsp; Ask Kelly Glossip.
