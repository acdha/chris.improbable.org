                                    <em>by Eric Martin</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Listening to critics of Obama's decision to try certain terrorist suspects in civilian courts, one gets the impression that Obama is taking a big risk, and that civilian courts are either ill-equipped to handle such cases, or the rules governing&nbsp;the proceedings in those venues create too big an advantage for&nbsp;defendants.&nbsp; Obama's critics argue that&nbsp;military commissions should be used&nbsp;instead - presumably because they are better suited for adjudicating such matters.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Here's the problem, though: civilian courts have a much better track record of convicting terrorists than military commissions - and the sentences tend to be longer when a conviction is handed down.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.democracyarsenal.org/2010/01/what-nyc-terror-trial-uproar-changes-nothing.html">Patrick Barry</a> explains by way of Ken Gude:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        Ken Gude, of the Center for American Progress, <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/01/criminal_courts_terrorists.html">writes</a>, “The facts are clear: Criminal courts are a far tougher and more reliable forum for prosecuting terrorists than military commissions.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The record of federal courts for trying terrorists, particularly since 9/11 is formidable.&nbsp; Former Republican Congressman from Oklahoma Mickey Edwards <a href="http://correspondents.theatlantic.com/mickey_edwards/2010/01/the_unbelievers.php">writes</a>: “[Critics] scowl and declare that our American courts will not, or can not, convict terrorists.&nbsp; They seem pretty damned certain of that.&nbsp; Which is weird since nearly 200 terrorists have been convicted in our federal courts in the last nine years <em><strong>(that's 65 times as many as have been convicted by military commissions).”</strong></em> A 2009 <a href="http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/media/usls/2009/alert/489/index.htm">report</a> by Human Rights First written by a team of former federal prosecutors found that terror trials in civilian courts had “a conviction rate of <em><strong>91.121%</strong></em>.” And for those still think the NYC issue somehow stems from the courts effectiveness at prosecuting extremists, a <a href="http://www.lawandsecurity.org/publications/Sept08TTRCFinal.pdf">study</a> by NYU’s center on Law and Security, found that NYC courts have a <em><strong>zero acquittal rate for terrorism cases.</strong></em> [...]
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Support for military commissions might make sense, if the commissions themselves weren't so ineffective and soft. Gude <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/01/criminal_courts_terrorists.html">explains</a>, “military commissions have never handled a single case of murder or attempted murder and have doled out shockingly short sentences to terrorists—even to a close associate of Osama bin Laden.”&nbsp; Moreover, “since their formation in November 2001, military commissions <strong><em>have only had one trial, negotiated one plea bargain, and convicted one defendant after he boycotted the proceedings,”</em></strong> while sustaining multiple supreme court challenges.&nbsp; <strong><em>Of the three individuals convicted in military commissions, two received sentences less than a year long.&nbsp;</em></strong>
                                    </p>

                                <p>
                                    Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.democracyarsenal.org/2010/01/gov-mcdonnells-soiled-thoughts-on-intel-the-underwear-bomber.html">Adam Blickstein</a> attempts to shoot down some of the miranda warning/right to counsel/interrogation nonsense flowing from the Obama administration's&nbsp;handling of the underwear bomber's arrest and interrogation.&nbsp; First, quoting <a href="http://washingtonindependent.com/74639/intel-chiefs-abdulmutallab-testimony-mess-gets-worse">Spencer Ackerman</a>:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        Collins said in a statement that the fact that the FBI read Abdulmutallab his Miranda rights “likely foreclosed the collection of additional intelligence information.” But over the weekend,&nbsp;The Associated Press published the most comprehensive account to date of Abdulmutallab’s interrogation and found no evidence that Mirandization inhibited interrogators’ access to valuable information. <strong>FBI interrogators, to the contrary, read him his Miranda rights after they were satisfied that he had no further information about any further attacks.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    And, again, quoting Ken Gude:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p>
                                            These conservatives clearly believe that the criminal system impedes intelligence collection because defendants get lawyers in the criminal system who always tell their clients to stop talking to the government. <strong>The only problem with this argument is that their recommended solution to this apparent problem—charging detainees in military commissions or holding them without charge in military detention—doesn’t change a defendant’s access to an attorney...</strong>Military commissions also have procedures prohibiting self-incrimination and ensuring that statements from the defendant are made voluntarily. <strong>There is virtually no difference between military commissions and criminal courts in the provision and availability of defense counsel.</strong>
                                        </p>
                                    </blockquote>
                                    <p>
                                        Gude also undercuts Jindal's argument by describing the litany of valuable and actionable intelligence America has obtained from terrorists with lawyers present. This intelligence gathered in the presence of legal counsel has, in fact, kept America safe...And, my god, all that information without torture!
                                    </p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p dir="ltr">
                                    Right, don't let the facts get in the way of a good talking point.&nbsp; It would be nice if&nbsp;the Republican&nbsp;Party&nbsp;decided to take a principled stand,&nbsp;embrace the facts&nbsp;and&nbsp;stop demagoguing these issues, which&nbsp;political opportunism&nbsp;serves to erode&nbsp;this nation's&nbsp;commitment to the&nbsp;rule of law and basic human rights - whether it be increased affinity for torture amongst the population, or willingness to detain suspects indefinitely without recourse.&nbsp; These cheap shots can be quite expensive in the long run.
