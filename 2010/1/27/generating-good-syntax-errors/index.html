                            <p>
                                One of the great religious debates in compiler writing is whether you should use parser generators like yacc and its many descendants or write parsers by hand, usually using recursive descent. On the one hand, using parser generators means you have a precise definition of the language that you are parsing, and a program does most of the grunt work for you. On the other hand, the proponents of hand-written recursive descent parsers argue that parser generators are overkill, that parsers are easy enough to write by hand, and that the result is easier to understand, more efficient, and can give better error messages when presented with syntactically invalid programs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Like in most religious debates, the choice of side seems to be determined by familiarity more than anything else. I knew how to use yacc before I knew how to write a parser by hand, which put me solidly on the parser generator side of the fence. Now that I do know how to apply both techniques, I'd still rather use a parser generator. In fact, I've worked on projects where I've written parser generators rather than write a parser by hand. Good notation counts for a lot, as we shall see.

                                    <b>Seibel:</b> And are there development tools that just make you happy to program?

                                Many of the objections raised by the hand-written parser camp are similar to Thompson's objection to lex—the tool doesn't do what you want—but there's no fundamental reason a tool can't. For example, the spurious conflicts that an LALR(1) algorithm produces are definitely hard to understand, but if you replace it with LR(1) or GLR(1), you get a more useful tool. And if you do learn how to work within the LALR(1) algorithm, even yacc is very powerful.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The objection to parser generates that seems to resonate most is that generators like yacc produce inadequate error messages, little more than “syntax error.” Better error messages were one of the key benefits hoped for when <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2000-10/msg00573.html">g++ converted</a> from a yacc-based C++ parser to a hand-written one (and to be fair, C++ syntax is nearly impossible to parse with any tool; the many special cases cry out for hand-written code). Here the objection seems harder to work around: the parser internally gets compiled into an automaton—usually a big table of numbers—that moves from state to state as it processes input tokens. If at some point it can't find a next state to go to, it reports an error. How could you possibly turn that into a good message?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Clinton Jeffery showed how in a paper published in ACM TOPLAS in 2003 titled “<a href="http://people.cs.vt.edu/~haebang//coursework/PL/summary.pdf">Generating LR Syntax Error Messages from Examples</a>.” As you can guess from the title, the idea is to introduce a training stage after the parser is generated but before it is used for real. In that stage, you feed examples of syntax errors into the parser and look at what state it ends up in when it detects the error, and maybe also what the next input token is. If the automaton hits an error in that state (and with that input token) during real use, you can issue the message appropriate to the example. The important part is that the parser states are basically an abstract summary of the surrounding context, so it's reasonable to treat errors in a particular state with a single message. For example, suppose you find that this Go program
                            </p>
                            <pre>
package main

import (
 "fmt",
 "math"
)
</pre>
                            <p>
                                causes a syntax error at the comma, in state 76. In the parser, that state means that you're in the middle of an import block and expecting to see a string constant. The state abstracts that context, so you'd end up in the same state if you were parsing this erroneous program:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
package fmt

import ( "strings"; "testing", "xgb" )
</pre>
                            <p>
                                Having told the parser that the appropriate error message for the first program is “unexpected , during import block,” the parser will use the same message for the second program.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's an elegant idea, and the implementation can be kept on the side, without adding any complexity to the grammar itself. I heard about this idea through the grapevine years ago (in 2000, I think) but had never gotten a chance to try it until this week.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are three Go parsers: Ian Lance Taylor wrote a hand-written recursive descent parser in C++ for gccgo, Robert Griesemer wrote a hand-written recursive descent parser in Go (<code>import "<a href="http://golang.org/pkg/go/parser">go/parser</a>"</code>) for <a href="http://golang.org/cmd/godoc/">godoc</a> and <a href="http://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">gofmt</a>, and Ken Thompson wrote a yacc-based parser in C for the gc compiler suite.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On Monday night, I <a href="http://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=7427b07b504271532d96c630d3dc37aef4d06c7d">implemented Jeffery's idea in the gc compiler suite</a>. The gc compilers use bison, the GNU implementation of yacc. Bison doesn't support this kind of error management natively, but it is not hard to adapt. Changing bison would require distributing a new version of bison; instead, my implementation post-processes bison's output.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The examples are in a new file <code><a href="http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/cmd/gc/go.errors?spec=svn7427b07b504271532d96c630d3dc37aef4d06c7d&amp;r=7427b07b504271532d96c630d3dc37aef4d06c7d">go.errors</a></code>. Because the lexer is written by hand, it's not available in the simulation, so the examples are token name sequences rather than actual program fragments. In token lists, the program above and its corresponding error message are:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
% loadsys package LIMPORT '(' LLITERAL import_package import_there ','
"unexpected , during import block",
</pre>
                            <p>
                                Understanding the tokens on the first line requires knowing what the various grammar token names mean, but they basically mimic the syntax, and this tool is targeted at the people working on the grammar anyway. An <a href="http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/src/cmd/gc/bisonerrors?spec=svn7427b07b504271532d96c630d3dc37aef4d06c7d&amp;r=7427b07b504271532d96c630d3dc37aef4d06c7d">awk program</a> loads bison's tables from its debugging dump <code>y.output</code> and then processes the <code>go.errors</code> file, replacing each line like the above with the number of the offending state and input token. That produces a table that can be linked into the compiler and consulted when a syntax error is encountered. If the state and input token match an entry in the table, the better error is used instead of a plain <code>syntax error</code>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That was an outsized amount of work to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=522">close one bug</a>, but now it's easy to add better messages for other common situations. For example, the fact that only the short <code>:=</code> declaration form is allowed in <code>for</code> initializers sometimes trips up new Go programmers. When presented with this program:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
 fmt.Printf("hello, world\n")
 for var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
  fmt.Println(i)
 }
}
</pre>
                            <p>
                                the compiler used to just say there was a syntax error on line 7, but now it explains:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
$ 6g x.go
x.go:7: syntax error: var declaration not allowed in for initializer
</pre>
                            <p>
                                because of this stanza in <code>go.errors</code>:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
% loadsys package imports LFUNC LNAME '(' ')' '{' LFOR LVAR LNAME '=' LNAME
"var declaration not allowed in for initializer",
</pre>
                            <p>
                                Gccgo and gofmt give more traditional token-based errors:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
$ gccgo x.go
x.go:7:6: error: expected operand
...

$ gofmt x.go
x.go:7:6: expected operand, found 'var'
</pre>
                            <p>
                                What's interesting isn't that neither has bothered to handle this as a special case yet. What's interesting is to consider the work required to do so. Changing either would require understanding the corresponding hand-written parser well enough to find the right place to put the special case. With the example-based approach, you just write an example, and the tool figures out where in the parser it needs to go.
