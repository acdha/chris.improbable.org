                                        [Today the] New York Times [has a] story on ailing banks that are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/business/27pay.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=business&amp;adxnnlx=1264600958-/jWQ507Z/VeQ%20r8NwKR0pg">nevertheless doling out huge bonus</a> packages. This is a throwback to 2008, when failing banks like Merrill Lynch paid out huge bonuses <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2009/july/pdfs/Bonus%20Report%20Final%207.30.09.pdf">at the same time</a> that they were incurring catastrophic losses.

                                        But one bank in particular stood out in the Times article: Citigroup. According to the Times, “Citigroup paid its employees so much in 2009 — $24.9 billion — that the company more than <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/business/27pay.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=business&amp;adxnnlx=1264600958-/jWQ507Z/VeQ%20r8NwKR0pg">wiped out every penny of profit</a>”:

                                            [T]o keep up with the Goldmans, laggards like Citigroup are handing out fat slices of their profits, leaving little left over for their shareholders. Citigroup is, in effect, paying its employees $1.45 for every dollar the company took in last year. On average, its workers stand to earn $94,000 each.

                                    Just pause and let that sink in.  Their compensation packages exceed the company's <strike>revenue</strike> profits.  At a time when the company is propped up on the taxpayer's dime(s).  Unconscionable.  Hand me a pitchfork, and grab ye a torch.

                                        This month, former Citigroup CEO John Reed slammed Wall Street’s return to stratospheric pay, saying “they just don’t get it. <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2010/01/11/reed-bonuses-get/">They are off in a different world</a>.” And when Citigroup goes this route, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/business/27pay.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=business&amp;adxnnlx=1264600958-/jWQ507Z/VeQ%20r8NwKR0pg">leaving little left over for shareholders</a>,” that means leaving little for taxpayers, who <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-01-26/davos-too-big-to-fail-as-bankers-recoil-in-political-backlash.html">still own the failed institution</a>. I still can’t understand the hesitancy of Treasury to rein in Citigroup, considering the large stake that the government has in the company.

                                        In the wider sense, this comes back to the inability (or reluctance, when it comes to investment banking) of shareholders to influence pay at the companies which they own. As James Kwak wrote, compensation ratios in the financial services industry should be closer to 30-40 percent (30 to 40 cents of each dollar earned going to compensation), and “<a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2010/01/27/good-for-goldman/">shareholders should apply pressure</a> to make this happen; basically, they should try to squeeze labor.”

                                        And there are <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/?p=4283">things the government can do</a> to improve corporate governance and make things easier for shareholders, who often face a herculean task trying to influence anything, including <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/06/24/coc-no-say-on-pay/">institutionalizing shareholder votes</a> on pay packages.

                                        “The investor in America sits at the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/business/27pay.html?ref=business">bottom of the food chain</a>,” said John Bogle, the founder and former chairman of the Vanguard Group mutual fund. “The financial industry gets paid before their clients, and we get paid whether times are good or bad.” Oh, and Citi will also be <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-01-26/davos-too-big-to-fail-as-bankers-recoil-in-political-backlash.html">hosting a cocktail party</a> at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week. Can every taxpayer, then, crash it?

                                    And to think, some people are complaining that the meager restrictions placed on the institutions that received TARP money - and those that received unrealistic dollar for dollar payouts from AIG after the U.S. government piped in billions - go too far.  Right.  Like that would even be remotely possible in today's political environment, which will surely get better now that the caps are off on corporate spending circa election time.
