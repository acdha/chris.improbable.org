                            <p>
                                We have been busy thinking through our <a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/01/21/how-the-citizens-united-case-affects-money-politics-and-transparency-as-we-know-it/">response</a> to the <a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/01/21/citizens_united_transparenc/">Citizens United decision</a>, an issue on the minds of people as diverse as <a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/01/24/president-obama-on-influence-peddling/">President Obama</a> and <a href="http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2010/01/26/the-daily-show-on-citizens-united/">Jon Stewart</a>.
