                                There are few job titles that are as vague, yet ubiquitous, as <em>web developer</em>. How the role is interpreted seems to vary from company to company and person to person. Where does the lack of clarity come from and what can we do about it as a community?
                            </p>

                                Definitions found online can be a huge source of confusion. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer" title="View web developer on Wikipedia">quick search</a> on Wikipedia provides us with the following:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    A web developer is a software developer or software engineer who is specifically engaged in the development of World Wide Web applications, or distributed network applications that are run over the HTTP from a web server to a web browser.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                In case you didn't catch that, a web developer is a software developer. Or a software engineer. It's one site and a very basic example, but with everyone from news organizations to students to public speakers citing Wikipedia in their articles, research papers and lectures, you can see how quickly poorly defined terms can propagate throughout society.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What if we break down the title itself?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most people have a general understanding of what the <strong>Web</strong> is. When Web is used in the title it becomes more unclear. Does Web mean Web sites? Mobile Web? Online stock trading software?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Developer</strong> is equally vague. Does this mean one writes HTML? Python? SQL? None of the above? All of the above? Does a developer actually <em>write</em> anything? Or does a developer plan and manage? What <em>is</em> the job description for web developer?
                            </p>

                                In other words if you would like to be considered for a job as a web developer, you'll need to know how to administer a server, write semantic front-end code, write SQL, understand core programming concepts, make fancy things happen with JavaScript, understand a web framework, and manage a slew of database management systems.
                            </p>

                                It seems then, that there is a problem with the perception of what the day-to-day taks of web developer are.

                            <p>
                                To complicate things, within our community there seems to be no consensus among how the position of web developer is interpreted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Back-end developers</em>: some interpret the role as one that relates to front-end markup and behavior only. Some expect a web developer to have design skills. Others may even refer to themselves as web developers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Front-end developers</em>: I would venture to say most front-end developers view themselves as web developers. I've seen individuals with only HTML/CSS skills refer to themselves as programmers too.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Designers</em>: depending on what type of designer you are, there are two viewpoints I've seen in my experience here. <strong>A</strong>: I'm going to design something and then give it to the web developer to make it happen. <strong>B</strong>: The only way for me to be a good web designer is to get my hands dirty and become a hybrid.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Executives</em>: depending on the size of the organization, the higher you go up the management chain the less is understood about what exactly web developer means. At the end of the day they may not necessarily be the hiring manager anyway and what is important is that the job gets done regardless of titles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Clients</em>: like almost everything else we do as web professionals, the end result is what matters, not a job title. Nonetheless, clients seem to be missing a clear understanding of the daily tasks of a web developer.

                            <p>
                                In a conversation I had with <a href="http://gregnewman.org/" title="Go to Greg Newman&amp;apos;s site. It&amp;apos;s from the future!">Greg Newman</a> regarding the issue of ambiguity of web developer, he brought up a good point. Greg and I both come from a design background and still maintain skills in design, front-end development, and back-end development. Sometimes job titles are made purposefully vague so they can cover a broad range of skills.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The way I see it, there are two types of people:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Generalists</em>: have a range of knowledge spanning multiple topics across several disciplines. An example here could be someone who designs, writes front-end code, and writes back-end logic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Specialists</em>: have an intense passion for a very specific discipline and do whatever they can to delve deeply into any sub-topic within that discipline. An example here could be someone who focuses on planning and writing complex back-end logic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the generalist's case, the title of web developer might be a good match because the variety of work lends itself to an open-ended title. In the specialist's case, web developer really wouldn't provide an accurate description of the work they perform.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                I'm by no means involved in the field of architecture, but landscape architect is very straight-forward and clearly defined outside the architecture community. I wouldn't go so far as advocating the removal of web developer from daily use. We do have <em>some</em> clear roles in the field (e.g. Flex/Flash Developer), but there is certainly room for improvement.

                                If web developer is going to be used as a title within the community, is there some way to clearly define the expectations of such individuals? Or should we as a community define the role as a generalization with more clearly defined sub-roles?

                                The main takeaway here is that web developer is a vague, broad reaching job title worthy of some discussion. The lack of clarity has an effect on our industry and individuals. No one seems to have a clear definition of the role which creates confusion within and outside the community. There are some obvious things that could be done to eliminate some confusion. The bigger question is should we do something or should we leave the role purposefully vague? I'd love to hear what you think.
