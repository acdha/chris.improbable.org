                                            If Democrats let go of health care, there is no doubt that a demoralized Democratic base will stay home in November. And that's as it should be. If the Democratic Party won't uphold its end of the bargain, there's no reason its base should pretend the deal is still on.
                                        </p>

                                    I'll go one further.  If the House Democrats let this die, I'm voting straight Republican in 2010.  Health care reform is one vote away in a House with +70 Dem majority.  To let it die, after coming so close, would be one of the greatest acts of moral failure and political cowardice in American history.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Don't get me wrong -- I've hated virtually everything I've heard from the anti-HCR voices at FDL.  Frankly, I think their tactics have been short-sighted and idiotic.  The hard part of health care, in the era of the automatic filibuster, is setting up the initial institutional framework.  After that framework is in place, everything else becomes much easier.  This is a moral issue -- people die because of the country's policy failures.  And doing nothing is a policy choice.  But the FDL crowd spent its efforts making nothing a reality.  Well, they've almost realized their dream.  And I wish them a hearty congratulations on that.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But this time, it's different.  This is a betrayal.  If the party can't pass health care reform <em>after</em> the anachronistic Senate has okayed it, and with reconciliation so doable, then I don't really see what the point of having power is.  Power must be about more than simply denying one's opponents the opportunity to do bad things.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Democrats are a big tent party.  But health coverage -- and the security it provides -- is one of those issues upon which all Democrats agree.  The party's reputation on the issue has played an integral role in building its current supermajorities.  People like Stupak are benefiting from the party's stance on health care, stances that helped secure majorities, even while they seek to prevent reform from happening.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Letting this die will not be forgiven, nor forgotten.  And if they do let it die, to hell with them all.  Let a new group of Democrats -- one not scared by the oh-so-mighty forces of the Massachusetts electorate in a special election -- come to power.  Let the congressional Democrats know that its supporters have a few (a very few) non-negotiable conditions.  When you have historic supermajorities, you pass health care reform.  Or at least you don't <em><strong>let it die</strong> when generations of effort and struggle are within one measly House vote of coming to fruition</em>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I'm 100% serious.  I'm voting GOP if they let this die.  Sarah Palin, sure.  She's scrappy.  Why not? 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This is why we fight.  This is why we poured our hearts into elections and political organizing.  For this very moment.  The Democratic Party is on the verge of the greatest domestic policy achievement in decades.  And it is simultaneously on the verge of an outrageous and immoral betrayal to their base from which they will not -- and should not -- soon recover.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    All that said, if they do pass it, we should celebrate and praise them.  It will be the greatest votes of their career.  They should just do it.  In 10 years, Republicans will be passionate supporters -- just like they are with Medicare.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So just pass it.  You won't have another shot anytime soon.  Barney Frank -- we need people like you on this.  Please shut up and start rowing.  This is why you're there.

                                    [<strong>UPDATE</strong>:  People should call their House member.  People should call Barney Frank.  Don't let this die without doing anything.]
