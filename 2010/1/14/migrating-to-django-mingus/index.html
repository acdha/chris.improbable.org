                            <p>
                                I've been running a blog since 2007 (check the archives!). At the time, it made most sense for me to go for a Plone-based blog. Plone was what I was most familiar with, and there was a simple blog product out there that I could use called, sensibly enough, SimpleBlog. In fact, you can still grab it - it's where you'd expect on the <a href="http://plone.org/products/simpleblog">Plone Products section</a>. And as you can see, the release there was the one that I used at the time - SimpleBlog 2.0, for Plone 2.5
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fast-forward to the start of 2010, and things have moved on. Plone's moved on, for sure. Plone 4 is just around the corner, and there's some really, really cool stuff in there: Dexterity, a new content types framework, finally looks like it'll make content type creation as easy as it should be, and simple types and behaviours can be created through the web. Deco, slated (last time I heard) for Plone 5, is quite literally going to make publishers wet themselves. And Deliverance has got great potential in helping to unify the many disparate systems which makes the typical corporate user's daily life such a grind. Thing is, I'm not a big corporate user; a lot of what makes Plone great for that environment is overhead for me and my little blog.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The big change for me personally, though, is that more and more of my work is now Django. About two thirds of 2009 was Zope 2/Five, and a third Django; 2010 is looking like it'll be the other way around. So, having decided that my blog was looking a little tired, and seemed to be a bit of a spam magnet, I decided to bite the bullet and do a complete rebuild in Django.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I didn't want to write yet-another-blog from scratch, so I picked what seemed to have the most buzz around it at the time - <a href="http://github.com/montylounge/django-mingus">Django Mingus</a> - and started from there. And this is how I did it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Oh, before I get stuck in, all the code for this site is open source. Fortunately, there's not much of it. There's no documentation as such (this is open source, after all) because the target audience is, well, me. I've stayed true to my Zope roots and used buildout; the buildout and Django project can be checked out from GitHub:
                            </p>
                            <p>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Onwards.

                            <p>
                                There's more to moving a blog than just installing your blog software and bashing out new articles. I had to consider a number of migration issues, specifically:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Obviously, I need to move all the content over from my old blog. That's not just articles: that's images, comments, the whole shebang.
                                </li>
                                <li>I needed to either keep all the old article URLs from my previous blog working, or have them redirect to the new URLs.
                                </li>
                                <li>Similarly, there are lots of RSS URLs out in the wild; I've handed a couple of them out to the Django community aggregator and the Planet Plone aggregator. There's also the main site feed.
                                </li>
                                <li>I decided not to move user accounts over, as I'd already decided that I wasn't going to require a login to comment. I was going to go with a ReCaptcha integration.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                So, the first step was obviously going to be to extract all the content from my old blog.
                            </p>
                            <h2>
                                Getting the content out of the ZODB
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Plone stores data in the ZODB. The ZODB is amazing. It was years ahead of its time, and provides a really natural way to store and interact with data in document-oriented systems. It's only really in the last year or so that we've seen the rise of broadly similar data stores, most of which talk HTTP and don't have the fine-grained transaction control that ZODB provides. The only thing to remember with the ZODB is that you can only access it directly with Python. That meant that I had to write a Python script to dump out all my content into a platform-neutral form. (I could have written a script which read the ZODB directly and created Django models, I guess. Using an XML intermediate format seemed easier though, and was probably quicker to work with - loading up the Plone 2.5 codebase is pretty slow.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most Plone applications, SimpleBlog included, stored its data using the Archetypes content type framework. Archetypes (often just AT) is a schema-driven approach to creating content. This is a pretty handy approach (even if AT's implementation was a bit awkward in places) as it's really simple to write code that can introspect that content. This was invaluable for writing an export script.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The result is on github: <a href="http://github.com/danfairs/Simple-AT-XML-Dump">Simple-AT-XML-Dump</a>. I should note that AT does have support for native XML dump and load. Thing is, I've got an ancient version of AT, and SimpleBlog used CMF (a layer underneath Plone) comments. I had no idea if XML marshalling would work properly, so I just did my own custom XML format. It's an instance script. It should work pretty well on any folderish Archetypes types. Invoke it like this:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
bin/instance run Simple-AT-XML-Dump/run.py -p /zodb/path/to/plone/content -o out.xml
</pre>
                            <p>
                                /zodb/path/to/plone/content is the physical path in the ZODB to dump. This needs to be the root folderish AT item. out.xml is the output file.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I won't go into the specifics of how the script works (if there's anything you're interested in especially, mail me or post a comment below). In a nutshell though, it'll dump out AT types by schema (including ImageFields with base64-encoded data) and any CMF discussions that are associated with them.
                            </p>

                                Starting with Django Mingus
                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                Many years of pain have taught me to automate my build. The XML dumper instance script above is pretty much the smallest thing I'll do without a build (and even now, I feel a twinge of guilt at not having packaged it properly.) For me, therefore, the first thing to do was to get a build up and running.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The system du jour seems to be to use pip and virtualenv. Pip (a replacement for easy_install) lets you specify requirements files, which define which Python packages you application uses, what versions of them, and lets you install directly from the major source control systems. (This ability seems to have caused lots of requirements files with github links in them to spring up in 'released' packages, especially in the Django world. I regard this as a Bad Thing; but that's an opinion piece for another time). However, grizzled Zope veterans tend to reach for buildout in such a circumstance so, wanting to restrict New Fangled stuff to learning how Mingus was put together, I stuck with that. Buildout predates pip and virtualenv, and so does stuff that you'd normally just do with virtualenv, like creating an isolated environment. Buildout config files are also a touch more verbose than requirements files. That said, I'm still pretty sure that buildout is the more extensible system, with a vast array of custom recipes; and, in common with a lot of software from the Zope world, the narrative documentation is atrocious.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I know buildout, and I'm not giving up these scars so easily, so that's what I went with, basing my buildout config on the requirements file that comes with Mingus. This process was actually pretty simple:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Set up a standard Django buildout using djangorecipe
                                </li>
                                <li>Pop mr.developer in as an extension, add [sources] for all of the editable (-e) eggs in the pip requirements file, and add them all as auto-checkout
                                </li>
                                <li>Put all the non-editable eggs from the requirements file into the eggs section of the buildout config
                                </li>
                                <li>Use the versions supplied in the requirements file to create a [versions] section in the buildout config
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                This gives me a buildout.cfg file that mirrors the Mingus requirements file, but will also:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Create the django management script and django WSGI file automatically
                                </li>
                                <li>Create a project and select an appropriate settings file for me
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                                The end result of this is the GitHub project I linked to above, <a href="http://github.com/danfairs/stereoplex-buildout">stereoplex-buildout</a>.

                                Automated content import is one of those things that you tell clients is usually impossible. And when they're migrating from a legacy CMS platform (or indeed, hand-maintained HTML), then that's usually right. The inevitable gigabytes of hand-rolled HTML are at best poorly formed, and at worse represent content which needs throwing away anyway.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was more fortunate. I didn't have that much content to migrate - 60-odd posts, and a few images - and Plone 2.5's default editor Kupu is actually pretty good at producing good HTML. I was able to directly use the existing HTML, and only needed to replace the &lt;img&gt; tags with the appropriate &lt;inline&gt; expected by Mingus.

                                Apache
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The Plone instance used a standard small setup: a single ZEO client talking to a ZEO server, fronted by Apache with the magic RewriteRule. The Zope configuration had been tweaked slightly to be usable on a small (by Plone's standard!) 512MB RAM host, but I hadn't had time to do any other optimisations (for example, serving static files from Apache) that I would normally do.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Django forces you to do at least some of these. Static files are always served by an external web server (unless you are really determined to sail through all the warnings in the documentation). I also finally got around to turning on gzip compression.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One remaining task that I planned to do in the Apache configuration was to provide redirects for my RSS feeds. This wasn't as easy as I might have liked, since the old feed URLs had query string elements; and indeed, it was some of those values that I needed to formulate a correct redirect. I ended up with the following:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
RewriteEngine On<br>RewriteCond %{query_string} ^(.*)?EntryCategory=(.*)?&amp;(.*)<br>RewriteRule ^/search_rss /feeds/categories/%2/ [R=permanent,L,NC]<br>
</pre>
                            <p>
                                This simply declares three match groups in the RewriteCond regex, the second of which (hence %2) is the category slug. The RewriteRule then issues a permanent redirect to the new URL. We have to use RewriteCond, because RewriteRule regexes won't match a query string, only the URL path.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Next up is the mod_wsgi configuration. I use a fairly standard configuration, which is generally as follows:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
WSGIScriptAlias / /var/websites/www.stereoplex.com/bin/django.wsgi<br>WSGIDaemonProcess stereoplex user=stereoplex group=stereoplex processes=3 threads=25 maximum-requests=1000 stack-size=524288<br>WSGIProcessGroup stereoplex<br>
</pre>
                            <p>
                                This runs the Stereoplex web application in its own process group, and with its own user and group membership. This is a safety net: if the site is compromised or (to be honest, more likely) I screw up and the app tries to write to the filesystem, its rights are limited by the host's file access control. The WSGI script file is generated by buildout. Probably the most interesting parameter here is the stack size. This is set lower than Linux's default value; for this sort of app, it doesn't need to be as large as the default. Setting this value to lower than the default led to a massive memory saving (remember, this is only a 512MB host; and this site is one of around half a dozen running on the same machine).
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Memcached

                            <p>
                                Mingus makes extensive use of Django's caching support. Other Django sites on the same host use a Memcached instance, so I just pointed Stereoplex at that one. Memcached is essentially in a default configuration, except only bound to the localhost IP address, rather than the public IP address. It's configured to use a maximum of 64MB of RAM. This doesn't sound a great deal, but even with two or three websites using it, I haven't seen it go over 40MB.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Nearly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If I'm honest, the content editing experience isn't as nice as Django as it was in Plone. This is expected. Plone is a CMS, and has an administrative interface that's focussed on the business of managing content. Django isn't a CMS, it's a more general web framework. The experience is more like editing content in the ZMI.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That said, there are advantages. I've found third-party Django software much easier to integrate and customise than third-party Plone products ever were. I'm not fighting reams of configuration all the time. There's a strong mindset of developing apps to be reusable in the Django world; Mingus itself is little more than some UI glue (as, really, is Stereoplex). If I were tasked with delivering a large CMS with flexible authentication and authorisation, workflow, and so forth: I'd go for Plone in an instant. But for this job, many of Plone's strengths simply don't apply, and somthing more simple and lightweight was more appropriate.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anyway - I'm quite pleased with the results. There are still a few kinks to be worked out (pygementize only seems to be being applied on the home page, not individual post pages, for example) but I'll get there over the next couple of weeks.
