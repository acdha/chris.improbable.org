                                    Jarring, headline generating <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/05/world/iran-may-be-able-build-atomic-bomb-5-years-us-israeli-officials-fear.html">news</a>:&nbsp;Iran is closer to building a nuclear weapon than previously predicted!!!
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">

                                        Iran is much closer to producing nuclear weapons than previously thought, and could be less than five years away from having an atomic bomb, several senior American and Israeli officials say.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        "The date by which Iran will have nuclear weapons is no longer 10 years from now," a senior official said recently, referring to previous estimates. "If the Iranians maintain this intensive effort to get everything they need, they could have all their components in two years. Then it will be just a matter of technology and research. If Iran is not interrupted in this program by some foreign power, it will have the device in more or less five years."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The reassessment of Iran's nuclear potential is now described by Israeli officials as the most serious threat facing their country.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Senior Israeli officials say that if the program is not halted, they will be forced to consider attacking Iran's nuclear reactors, a tactic they used against Iraq in 1981, when Israeli warplanes bombed an Iraqi reactor.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        "When we look at the future and ask ourselves what is the biggest problem we will face in the next decade," a senior Israeli military official said, "Iran's nuclear bomb is at the top of the list."

                                        The acceleration of the Iranian nuclear program represents a defeat for the Clinton Administration's drive to halt the spread of nuclear technology to Iran.

                                        With a nuclear arsenal, analysts say, Iran could also try to dominate its neighbors on the Persian Gulf, including Iraq, which before the gulf war of 1991 had an advanced nuclear weapons program of its own. Such domination, they say, could lead to Iranian control of the flow and price of oil to the West.

                                    Iran didn't&nbsp;even need a nuke to gain considerable influence&nbsp;in Iraq.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just an exceedingly&nbsp;useful Bush administration that grew enamored with the same foreign policy espoused by the gurus that&nbsp;tell of our urgent&nbsp;need to attack Iran now because, once again, Iran is only a few years away from a nuclear weapon which will upend the order of the world.&nbsp; Further, it's not as if Iran's influence in Iraq has led to anything even remotely resembling the nefarious oil-flow pricing control schemes previously feared.
                                </p>

                                    Actually, if the most recent NIE is to be believed, Iran doesn't even have an active weapons program at this juncture.&nbsp; While it's certainly possible that the NIE's judgment are incorrect, and Iran does&nbsp;has an active weapons program, or a desire to return to one in the near future, it is also possible that Iran wants to perfect enrichment for domestic purposes, while remaining close to weaponization which it can pursue&nbsp;if deemed necessary.&nbsp; From a report discussed in a <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2009/04/by-eric-martin--the-american-foreign-policy-project-has-put-forthafact-based-level-headed-andinsightful-policy-paper-on-the.html">prior post</a>:

                                        In practice, Iran's current path preserves at least three different options, the first and last of which are not mutually exclusive: (a) pursuing enrichment for nuclear energy use as a source of national pride and a symbol of Iran's refusal to be cowed, (b) using its enrichment as a bargaining chip in larger negotiations with the United States and its allies, or (c) pursuing a weapon either to deter a feared U.S. or Israeli attack, or to support aggressive goals, including expanding its influence in the region.&nbsp; The U.S. intelligence community believes that Iran probably has not yet made a firm decision with regard to nuclear weapons, and that decision may well depend in large part on what the United States and its allies do.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        According to U.S. intelligence community estimates, Iran is not expected to accumulate enough fissile material for even a single weapon until sometime in the 2010-2015 time frame, and that would require a "break-out" that almost certainly would be detected. What this means, in Secretary of Defense Robert Gates' words, is that: "They're not close to a stockpile, they're not close to a weapon at this point, and so there is some time."&nbsp;
