                            <p>
                                Ron Hanby, struggling with depression, took his own life on October 2, 2008.&nbsp; Mark Goldberg, his partner of 17 years, battled Rhode Island bureaucracy for weeks before the state would release Ron’s body to him.&nbsp; Ron had no living relatives.&nbsp; The couple, however, did have:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>wills
                                </li>
                                <li>living wills
                                </li>
                                <li>power of attorney documents
                                </li>
                                <li>and a Connecticut marriage certificate (Rhode Island doesn’t permit same-sex marriage or even civil unions)
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                None of that mattered in Rhode Island.&nbsp; Mark spent every day of his immediate grief on the phone with state officials, trying to get his husband’s body out of the morgue.&nbsp; Finally, after four weeks, a state bureaucrat took a special interest and helped him get Ron’s body released.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One good thing came out of this: Rhode Island’s state legislators wrote a bill creating funeral rights for domestic partners.&nbsp; They passed it in a bipartisan show of humanity: 63-1 in the House, unanimously in the Senate.&nbsp; And the Republican governor vetoed it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now the National Organization for Marriage is urging legislators not to override that veto.&nbsp; Chris Plante (executive director of NOM-RI), has <a href="http://pamshouseblend.com/diary/14684/nomri-pressures-legislators-not-to-override-carcieris-funeral-rights-veto">written to them</a>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    [T]he proposed legislation simply is not necessary… The right of any person, without regard to sexual preference or relationship to the decedent, to serve as a designated funeral-planning agent is already expressly guaranteed by Rhode Island Law 5-33.1-4. That statute only requires a simple notarized form naming an agent.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Ah, yes, Rhode Island Law 5-33.1-4.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; And what can we say in return except:
                            </p>
                            <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                <span style="color:#800000"><span style="font-size:medium"><strong><em>Thank you Mr. Plante!</em></strong></span></span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We keep hearing that same-sex marriage isn’t necessary, that we can secure civil equality by visiting lawyers and drawing up contracts.&nbsp; That’s false, but people don’t always understand that.&nbsp; Luckily for us, Mr. Plante has taken this argument into the realm of satire:&nbsp; Mark and Ron had wills, power of attorney, and an actual marriage license?&nbsp; Simpletons!&nbsp; They should have known to go to a notary and designate each other as <strong><em>funeral planning agents</em></strong>, pursuant to R.I. Law 5-33.1-4!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Franz Kafka wrote this kind of satire.&nbsp; The term “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafkaesque">Kafkaesque</a>” describes a world in which <em>“characters lack a clear course of action, the ability to see beyond immediate events, and the possibility of escape. The term’s meaning has transcended the literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly complex, bizarre, or illogical.”</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Compare that to <a href="http://marriageequalityri.wordpress.com/2009/02/13/goldberg-letter-to-sen-whitehouse-partner-burial-rights/">Mark’s own description</a> of what his life turned into:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    I called the Police to our home where the death occurred and in two hours they performed their investigation, offered their condolences, removed Ron’s body and left our house.&nbsp; No one offered any information on what I was to do next.&nbsp; No phone number to contact the detective in charge, no information on where they were taking Ron’s body, no information on what I as his partner for so many years should do next.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ron had no next of kin other than me. &nbsp; I shared our Wills, Living Wills, Power of Attorney and Marriage Certificate to the Police Department, Medical Examiner’s Office and the Department of Health, but no one was willing to see these documents.&nbsp; The State Law stated that a two week search for next of kin must be done.&nbsp; The Medical Examiner’s office waited a full week before placing an ad in the Providence Journal.&nbsp; After no one responded they waited another week to send paperwork to the Health and Human Services Department listing Ron as an unclaimed body.&nbsp; During this four week process, I was on the phone every day trying to convince someone, anyone, that I was the person claiming Ron’s body.&nbsp; The same response came back to me every time; “It’s State law, our hands are tied, there’s nothing we can do”.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I attempted to place an obituary in the Providence Journal and again, I was denied because we were not blood relatives, and the Journal had to comply with state rules.&nbsp; GLAD, the Gay and Lesbian Advocacy and Defenders could not help me because our bond was not recognized in the State of RI.&nbsp; After four weeks an employee in the Department of General Public Assistance of Human Services took pity upon me and my plight.&nbsp; She reviewed our documentation and was able to get all parties concerned to release Ron’s body to me.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Mr. Plante and NOM look at this nightmare and say, <em>No problem</em>.&nbsp; Because, after all, Mark and Ron could have avoided it simply by following the instructions in Rhode Island Law 5-13.1-4.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’ll make a deal with NOM:&nbsp; If they specify every law, every form, and every contract – in every state – that gay couples need to pursue in order to secure their rights as a couple, than I’ll do the same for straights.&nbsp; In fact, I’ll provide a complete and exhaustive list for straight Californians right now:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="http://www.cdph.ca.gov/CERTLIC/BIRTHDEATHMAR/Pages/MarriageLicenseInformation.aspx">California Marriage License, Registration and Ceremony Information</a>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Okay, NOM, your turn.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I doubt NOM will return the favor.&nbsp; They don’t want us to have <em>any</em> rights and benefits of marriage.&nbsp; Mr. Plante is clear about his reasons for opposing the funeral rights law.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>

                                    [T]he legislation in question is actually an exploitation of Mr. Goldberg’s tragedy by the homosexual-marriage activists in Rhode Island.&nbsp; Despite their claims to the contrary, these bills serve simply as “Trojan Horses” for homosexual-marriage.&nbsp; In California and Connecticut…courts found that when rights of domestic partners, under either that nomenclature or as “civil-unions,” were expanded…that the State must by extension fully recognize homosexual marriage…
                                </p>

                                    As such, NOM – Rhode Island respectfully requests that you vote to sustain the Governor’s veto both to avoid creating unnecessary law and to not move Rhode Island closer to recognizing homosexual-marriage.
                                </p>

                                NOM doesn’t just oppose marriage equality.&nbsp; They don’t just oppose robust civil unions or watered-down domestic partnerships.&nbsp; They oppose anything that might constitute even the slightest formal recognition of our relationships.&nbsp; They want instead to send us running down a thousand different legal avenues in a labyrinth that they’re lobbying to turn against us.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Franz Kafka won a place in literature by creating a vivid and chilling world of bureaucratic brutality.&nbsp; That’s the world in which NOM wants us to live.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>UPDATE:&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s not just NOM who wants us to live in this nightmare bureaucratic world.&nbsp; Even the <a href="http://newsblog.projo.com/2009/11/carcieri-says-ri-funeral-plann.html">governor</a> is endorsing this hardship.</strong>
