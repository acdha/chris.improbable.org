                                Back in 2008, Democratic voters were presented with a choice between a seasoned veteran of Washington who wasn't much beloved by the base and wasn't known for inspiring speeches, but who had the long experience in government and realistic view of the legislative process necessary to succeed at the inside game, and an inspiring newcomer who had little experience with -- or evident patience for -- Washington's ways, but seemed a once-in-a-generation communicator, and was beloved by the progressive base. They chose the guy they liked, figuring that what he didn't know about Washington he could make up by getting the country on his side.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the presidency of Barack Obama has been more inside game than outside game. The tax cut deal is yet another example. On the face of it, it's not a bad deal. Republicans gets $130 billion in tax breaks for the wealthy, and Democrats get about $300 billion in more stimulative, more progressive breaks and unemployment benefits. That's more than anyone thought Obama likely to get from these negotiations. But it was a deal struck in a back room, without buy-in from the president's base, and then sold at a press conference were Obama lectured liberals about the compromises required to pass Social Security, Medicare, and the founding of this country, and the dangers of "sanctimony." As you might imagine, that didn't go over too well with liberals, and now we're in another of the occasional flare-ups between Obama and his base.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As of yet, Obama hasn't proven very effective at building support for liberal legislation. There are lots of reasons of this, only some of them relating to his sales job, but the fact of the matter is that neither stimulus nor health-care reform nor a more activist government are particularly popular right now. But Obama has proven extremely effective at passing liberal legislation: Though the bills are imperfect and filled with difficult compromises, Obama passed health-care reform, has gotten, at this point, well more than a trillion dollars in stimulus, and leads a more activist and engaged government than this country has seen in many years. I don't think anyone, looking at the Obama campaign in 2008, would expect his presidency to have shown both the strengths and the weaknesses that it has.

                                But Wonkbook leads today with sadder news: The passing of Elizabeth Edwards. I spent some time with Edwards over the years, and I've never known a policy wonk so capable of explaining to people why the country needed to make the choices it needed to make, nor a communicator so able and eager to grasp the specifics of the policies she was talking about. She will be terribly missed.

By the end, it was like a seminar that she was conducting for the rest. She was talking mainly not about her husband's campaign but about her assessment of the larger shape of the presidential race. Where Bush and Cheney would be most vulnerable in the general election; what Karl Rove had figured out; how the New Hampshire results would position the Democrats for 'mini-Tuesday' the next week and 'super-Tuesday' a month later; how Democrats could talk about economic justice without sounding like big-government spendthrifts; what to say and do about Iraq.There was nothing 'brave' or tragic about it, just someone who was intelligent, clear-eyed, and tough. I would like to remember that accomplished side of her."

Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) was among those who emerged unconvinced. 'I'm just staggered by the enormity of this package,' she said. Others were in full revolt. Sen. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) was one of three senators who interrupted Biden's presentation. Afterward, he vowed to 'do everything I can to defeat this proposal,' including staging a filibuster... House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) ignored the deal in a statement that lambasted Republicans, saying they have 'held the middle class hostage for provisions that benefit only the wealthiest 3 percent.'"

                                <strong>Replacing Making Work Pay with a payroll tax cut harms the poor, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/us/politics/08impact.html">reports</a> David Kocieniewski:</strong> "The proposal does not include an extension of Mr. Obama’s signature tax cut, the Making Work Pay credit, which provided a credit of up to $400 for individuals and $800 for families of low and moderate income. Instead, the plan creates a one-year reduction in Social Security payroll taxes, which are generally levied on the first $106,800 of income. For an individual earning $110,000, that provision would reduce payroll taxes by $2,136. Although the $120 billion payroll tax reduction offers nearly twice the tax savings of the credit it replaces, it will nonetheless lead to higher tax bills for individuals with incomes below $20,000 and families that make less than $40,000. That is because their payroll tax savings are less than the $400 or $800 they will lose from the Making Work Pay credit."

The GOP got around $95 billion in tax cuts for wealthy Americans and $30 billion in estate tax cuts. Democrats got $120 billion in payroll-tax cuts, $40 billion in refundable tax credits (Earned Income Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and education tax credits), $56 billion in unemployment insurance, and, depending on how you count it, about $180 billion (two-year cost) or $30 billion (10-year cost) in new tax incentives for businesses to invest."

                                "[But] the White House disappeared into a closed room with the Republicans and cut a deal that they'd made no effort to sell to progressives. When the deal was cut, the president took an oblique shot at their preferences, saying 'the American people didn’t send us here to wage symbolic battles or win symbolic victories.' And this came a mere week or two after the White House announced a federal pay freeze. The pattern, for progressives, seems clear: The White House uses them during elections, but doesn't listen to, or consult them, while governing. In fact, it insults them, and then tells them to quiet down, they got the best bargain possible, even if it wasn't the one they'd asked for, or been promised."

Forecasting firms on Tuesday <a href="http://www.economy.com/dismal/article_free.asp?cid=195430">upgraded their estimates</a> for growth and job gains over the next two years. Economists at Goldman Sachs, who have been more negative and more accurate than most Wall Street forecasters lately, called the deal 'significantly more positive' than they had anticipated. And left-leaning policy experts said the package did more to create jobs than they had thought possible after the Republicans’ midterm election victories. <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3340">Robert Greenstein</a>, <a href="http://www.epi.org/">Lawrence Mishel</a> and <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/pressroom/statements/2010/12/taxuideal">John Podesta</a> -- who run prominent Washington research groups that range from liberal to staunchly liberal -- all offered praise for the package."

But I'm less convinced about the wisdom of additional payroll tax cuts to stimulate spending by American households that, after decades of over-consumption, are finally beginning to save again. Democrats rightfully complained that the tax cuts were the least-effective parts of the original stimulus package, and there is no reason to expect they will work any better this time...The bigger problem with the tax deal is that it represents a big step backward on the road to getting deficits under control."

The revised pact contains new protections for U.S. auto makers, but didn't change the original 2007 pact significantly when it came to beef. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), who will take over as the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee next year, also expressed reservations about some aspects of the deal, but said he would support its passage."

                                <strong>Still to come:</strong> Congressional Democrats are in revolt over the tax cut deal; health care reform is leading to cuts to children's hospitals; the FCC's net neutrality proposal could hurt online video; Rep. Fred Upton will chair the House Energy and Commerce Committee; and cats with Santa beards.

                                <strong>Children's hospitals are losing money for "orphan drugs", <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/health/policy/08health.html">reports</a> Robert Pear:</strong> "Over the last 18 years, Congress has required drug manufacturers to provide discounts to a variety of health care providers, including community health centers, AIDS clinics and hospitals that care for large numbers of low-income people. Several years ago, Congress broadened the program to include children’s hospitals. But this year Congress, in revising the drug discount program as part of the new health care law, blocked these hospitals from continuing to receive price cuts on orphan drugs intended for treatment of diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States...Children’s hospitals say the change is costing them hundreds of millions of dollars."

                                <strong>Republican support for anti-health care reform lawsuits is hypocritical, <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/46027.html">writes</a> Michael Kinsley:</strong> "If there is one thing your typical Republican politician does not care for (I have always been given to understand), it is an 'activist judge.'...If there is one more thing your typical Republican politician does not care for, it is frivolous lawsuits that clog the courts and unfairly burden innocent doctors and small-business persons as they go about trying to create jobs...So it is puzzling to learn that 32 Republican senators have filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking a U.S. District Court judge to invalidate President Barack Obama’s health care reform."

Analysts say pay-as-you-go Internet access could put the brakes on the burgeoning online video industry, handing a victory to cable and satellite TV providers. The practice is legal, but had been discouraged by the FCC and by protests from consumers and public interest groups. But wireless companies are moving rapidly in that direction - all major cellphone providers offer subscribers tiered data plans for Internet service."

Several senior Democratic aides said the two bills were discussed in conjunction with each other at a leadership meeting Tuesday afternoon, though no final decision had been made...The House is expected to vote on the DREAM Act Wednesday, with the Senate holding a test vote on the measure later in the day. The agriculture bill, known as AgJobs, is designed to lure the votes of more rural members of the House."

The chamber has teamed up against the Legal Arizona Workers Act with allies including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Service Employees International Union and a Latino group that Justice Sonia Sotomayor once helped lead. The Obama administration is sending the government's top litigator to assist the chamber's lawyer. 'It's a rather compelling story to have all these groups that usually are on opposite sides come together,' said Robin Conrad, who heads the chamber's litigation arm."

A national 'clean' or 'renewable' energy standard would require utilities to purchase a percentage of their electricity from nonfossil fuel sources and is seen as one of the administration's few options for a broad energy policy after the death of the cap-and-trade bill...Senate coalition championed by Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) has pushed for a standard focused on renewable sources favored by environmental groups, including wind, solar and geothermal, and the Obama administration and House Democrats are on board as well."

'If they quote me correctly, I've never said it's outrageous to even think about global warming. I want some proof,' he said. 'If I get the chair and have the gavel, I'm going to subpoena people from both sides and try to put them under oath and try to find out what the real facts are.' But he said he does want to question all sides of the issue, including the scientists at the center of the so-called 'Climategate' controversy surrounding e-mails stolen from climate researchers last year in England.
