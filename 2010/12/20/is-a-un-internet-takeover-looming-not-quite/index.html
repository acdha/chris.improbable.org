                                Perhaps you saw or heard the headlines last Friday or over the weekend: the United Nations could take over the Internet! (Or, as the Drudge Report put it, "UN PLANS INTERNET REGULATION.") This, you may not be surprised to learn, isn't quite accurate. A UN working group is currently talking about what, if anything, it could do to improve the operation of its <a href="http://www.intgovforum.org/cms/">Internet Governance Forum</a> (IGF), a group devoted to dialogue but possessing no decision-making powers. But some are making plans to give the UN far more power.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Back in 2006, the UN endorsed a call from the World Summit on the Information Society to create a multi-stakeholder forum for dialogue about Internet governance issues. This became the IGF, which has now met five times—in Athens, Rio de Janeiro, Hyderabad, Sharm El Sheikh, and most recently in Vilnius.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                IGF does plenty of jawing, which can be quite useful, but it doesn't actually have any power. According to the document setting up the IGF, its mission is to "discuss," "facilitate," "advise," "identify," "promote and assess." That's it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                IGF meetings gather delegates from government, industry, and civil society for a big annual shindig. What do they talk about at these meetings? The "Internet," for one thing. Also, "people" and "access." (See below for an IGF-generated text cloud of the most common words appearing in IGF proceedings over the last five years.)
                            </p>

                                In May 2010, the UN's Commission on Science and Technology (CSTD) decided that the IGF could be improved after its initial five-year run. It called for a new working group that would "seek, compile and review inputs from all Member States and all other stakeholders on improvements to the Internet Governance Forum (IGF)."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                No problem there, really, but when CSTD actually assembled the working group in early December, only governments were <a href="http://www.unctad.org/Templates/Page.asp?intItemID=5755&amp;lang=1">on the list</a>. With the working group's first meeting scheduled for a week later, this didn't allow people much time to complain, but Google's Vint Cerf did take to the company blog on December 17.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "This move has been condemned by the Internet Governance Caucus, the Internet Society (ISOC), the International Chamber of Commerce and numerous other organizations—who have published a <a href="http://isoc.org/wp/newsletter/files/2010/12/IGF-Working-Group-Decision1.pdf">joint letter</a> (PDF) and launched an online petition to mobilize opposition," <a href="http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2010/12/governments-shouldnt-have-monopoly-on.html">wrote Cerf</a>. "Today, I have signed that petition on Google’s behalf because we don’t believe governments should be allowed to grant themselves a monopoly on Internet governance. The current bottoms-up, open approach works—protecting users from vested interests and enabling rapid innovation."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The fear here is clear (try saying that three times fast): an IGF overhaul committee made up only of governments might get some very government-friendly ideas, such as that IGF should get more power and should serve as a forum for deciding on issues like Internet crime and security, without the involvement of ISPs, Internet companies, and nonprofit civil society groups.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Indeed, there was such a proposal law week, though it came out of a separate process. While the IGF working group prepared for its meetings in Geneva, UN diplomats back in New York were considering various proposals to work more closely together on Internet governance issues.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Representatives from Brazil called for an international body made up of Government representatives that would attempt to create global standards for policing the internet—specifically in reaction to challenges such as WikiLeaks," said Australia's <a href="http://www.itnews.com.au/News/242051,un-mulls-internet-regulation-options.aspx">ITNews</a>, reporting on one of these.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The debate in New York centered on the need for "enhanced cooperation," with some delegates arguing that there wasn't much point to "cooperation" in the existing IGF if the group couldn't ever get around to making decisions. But Brazil's suggestion was opposed by others and hasn't gone anywhere yet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Brazil's delegate, one of the big backers of "enhanced cooperation," said after criticism of his idea that he wanted to make a "clarification" and that "we do not want any kind of misgivings about a UN takeover of the process" (see 2:00:00 into <a href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/tv/webcast/2010/12/special-event-2.html">this UN webcast</a>). Instead, he said that Brazil wanted "more democracy in Internet governance," and it became clear as he spoke that Brazil feels like key Internet decisions are too often made by a few powerful countries or stakeholders.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Giving governments more power in a new UN forum might give countries like Brazil more of a stake in the Internet's governance—though the delegate's decision to use Wikileaks as his main example will surely raise concerns among those already worried that governments might be too prone to censorship and control.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Certainly, there's a need for vigilance here; one shudders at the thought of China and Saudi Arabia, for instance, helping to set global Internet policing norms. But we're a long way from anything like that. Right now, there's little more than some working groups tossing out ideas, the most controversial of which has already managed to aggravate Google, ICANN, the Internet Society, Nominet, and numerous others (to say nothing of governments like the US, which worry about both Internet openness but also their own current level of control).

                            <p>
                                As for the IGF, it looks quite likely to continue in some form, given the interest in its first five meetings. IGF has so far encouraged broad participation that goes well beyond governments; indeed, this has been one of its best features.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For instance, parts of the IGF 2006 meeting were downright feisty. Our <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2006/10/8115.ars">coverage of the meeting</a> gives you a taste:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Steve Ballinger of Amnesty International took the microphone second and wanted to talk about IT companies "that have colluded with repressive countries, particularly in China." An Agence France reporter was "very interested in the Cisco participation in this panel because I would like to ask him what happened with the software material they've sold to the Chinese police." And with that, the panel was off and running.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With members of the BBC, Microsoft, Cisco, human rights organizations, social justice NGOs, and the European Court of Human Rights on the panel, there was plenty to talk about—and participants did so, for quite some time. This was apparently too much for Yang Xiaokun, a Chinese diplomat to the UN in Geneva, who stood up and defended his country. "In China, we don't have software blocking Internet sites. Sometimes we have trouble accessing them. But that's a different problem," he said.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This, of course, is a bizarre claim to make, and no one on the panel bought it. Xiaokun went on to add, "I've heard people say that the BBC is not available in China or that it's blocked. I'm sure I don't know why people say this kind of thing." Richard Sambrook of the BBC then let him know exactly why people say this kind of thing, saying, "If he was in China he would not be able to listen to our Mandarin service on short wave radio and not be able to read our Mandarin news site on the website."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It was a surreal moment, especially when the Chinese diplomat was asked to elaborate on the restrictions that were in place in China. His response: "We do not have restrictions at all." To which someone in the audience shouted out, "Come on!"
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                The incident with China serves as a good reminder of why setting up a separate governments-only Internet policy body with real powers might well be a bad idea—and why having independent voices and journalists around can be quite useful at cutting through the BS.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the UN hasn't yet set up any such organization, nor has it given the IGF extra power; indeed, last week was only the first meeting for the new IGF working group, and "enhanced cooperation" has been on the table for years without making much progress.
                            </p>
