                            <p>
                                I love Christmas. I love walking around the streets of London, looking at the beautifully decorated windows, seeing the shiny lights that hang above Oxford Street and listening to Christmas songs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’m not going to lie though. Not only do I like buying presents, I love receiving them too. I remember making long lists that I would send to Father Christmas with all of the Lego sets I wanted to get. I knew I could only get one a year, but I would spend days writing the perfect list.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The years have gone by, but I still enjoy making wish lists. And I’ll tell you a little secret: my mum still asks me to send her my Christmas list every year.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This time I’ve made my <em><span>CSS</span></em> wish list. As before, I’d be happy with just one present.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Before I begin…
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                … this list includes:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>things that don’t exist in the <span>CSS</span> specification (if they do, please let me know in the comments – I may have missed them);
                                </li>
                                <li>others that are in the spec, but it’s incomplete or lacks use cases and examples (which usually means that properties haven’t been implemented by even the most recent browsers).
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Like with any other wish list, the further down I go, the more unrealistic my expectations – but that doesn’t mean I can’t wish. Some of the things we wouldn’t have thought possible a few years ago have been implemented and our wishes fulfilled (think multiple backgrounds, gradients and transformations, for example).
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                The list
                            </h3>
                            <h4>
                                Cross-browser implementation of font-size-adjust
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                When one of the fall-back fonts from your font stack is used, rather than the preferred (first) one, you can retain the aspect ratio by using this very useful property. It is incredibly helpful when the fall-back fonts are smaller or larger than the initial one, which can make layouts look less polished.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What <code>font-size-adjust</code> does is divide the original <code>font-size</code> of the fall-back fonts by the <code>font-size-adjust</code> value. This preserves the x-height of the preferred font in the fall-back fonts. Here’s a simple example:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
<code>p {
    font-family: Calibri, "Lucida Sans", Verdana, sans-serif;
    font-size-adjust: 0.47;
}
</code>
</pre>
                            <p>
                                In this case, if the user doesn’t have Calibri installed, both Lucida Sans and Verdana will keep Calibri’s aspect ratio, based on the font’s x-height. This property is a personal favourite and one <a href="http://webdesignernotebook.com/css/the-little-known-font-size-adjust-css3-property/">I keep pointing to</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Firefox supported this property from version three. So far, it’s the only browser that does. Fontdeck provides the <code>font-size-adjust</code> value along with its fonts, and has <a href="http://fontdeck.com/font-size-adjust.html">a handy tool for calculating it</a>.
                            </p>
                            <h4>
                                More control over overflowing text
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                The <code>text-overflow</code> property lets you control text that overflows its container. The most common use for it is to show an ellipsis to indicate that there is more text than what is shown. To be able to use it, the container should have <code>overflow</code> set to something other than <code>visible</code>, and <code>white-space: nowrap</code>:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
<code>div {
    white-space: nowrap;
    width: 100%;
    overflow: hidden;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
</code>
</pre>
                            <p>
                                This, however, only works for blocks of text on a single line. In the wish list of many <span>CSS</span> authors (and in mine) is a way of defining <code>text-overflow: ellipsis</code> on a block of multiple text lines. Opera has taken the first step and added support for the <a href="http://people.opera.com/dstorey/text/text-overflow.html"><code>-o-ellipsis-lastline</code> property</a>, which can be used instead of <code>ellipsis</code>. This property is not part of the CSS3 spec, but we could certainly make good use of it if it were…
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                WebKit has <code>-webkit-line-clamp</code> to specify how many lines to show before cutting with an ellipsis, but support is patchy at best and there is no control over where the ellipsis shows in the text. Many people have spent time wrangling JavaScript to do this for us, but the methods used are very processor intensive, and introduce a JavaScript dependency.
                            </p>

                                Indentation and hanging punctuation properties
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                You might notice a trend here: almost half of the items in this list relate to typography. The lack of fine-grained control over typographical detail is a general concern among designers and <span>CSS</span> authors. Indentation and hanging punctuation fall into this category.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The CSS3 specification introduces two new possible values for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#edge-effects"><code>text-indent</code> property</a>: <code>each-line</code>; and <code>hanging</code>. <code>each-line</code> would indent the first line of the block container and each line after a forced line break; <code>hanging</code> would invert which lines are affected by the indentation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The proposed <code>hanging-punctuation</code> property would allow us to specify whether opening and closing brackets and quotes should hang outside the edge of the first and last lines. The specification is still incomplete, though, and asks for more examples and use cases.
                            </p>
                            <h4>
                                Text alignment and hyphenation properties
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Following the typographic trend of this list, I’d like to add better control over text alignment and hyphenation properties. The CSS3 module on Generated Content for Paged Media already specifies <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-css3-gcpm-20070205/#hyphenation">five new hyphenation-related properties</a> (namely: <code>hyphenate-dictionary</code>; <code>hyphenate-before</code> and <code>hyphenate-after</code>; <code>hyphenate-lines</code>; and <code>hyphenate-character</code>), but it is still being developed and lacks examples.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the text alignment realm, the new <code>text-align-last</code> property allows you to define how the last line of a block (or a line just before a forced break) is aligned, if your text is set to <code>justify</code>. Its value can be: <code>start</code>; <code>end</code>; <code>left</code>; <code>right</code>; <code>center</code>; and <code>justify</code>. The <code>text-justify</code> property should also allow you to have more control over text set to <code>text-align: justify</code> but, for now, only Internet Explorer supports this.
                            </p>
                            <h4>
                                calc()
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                This is probably my favourite item in the list: the <code>calc()</code> function. This function is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#calc">part of the CSS3 Values and Units module</a>, but it has only been implemented by Firefox (4.0). To take advantage of it now you need to use the Mozilla vendor code, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/-moz-calc"><code>-moz-calc()</code></a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Imagine you have a fluid two-column layout where the sidebar column has a fixed width of 240 pixels, and the main content area fills the rest of the width available. This is how you could create that using <code>-moz-calc()</code>:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
<code>#main {
    width: -moz-calc(100% - 240px);
}
</code>
</pre>
                            <p>
                                Can you imagine how many hacks and headaches we could avoid were this function available in more browsers? Transitions and animations are really nice and lovely but, for me, it’s the ability to do the things that <code>calc()</code> allows you to that deserves the spotlight and to be pushed for implementation.
                            </p>
                            <h4>
                                Selector grouping with -moz-any()

                            <p>
                                The <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/05/moz-any-selector-grouping/"><code>-moz-any()</code> selector grouping</a> has been introduced by Mozilla but it’s not part of any <span>CSS</span> specification (yet?); it’s currently only available on Firefox 4.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This would be especially useful with the way HTML5 outlines documents, where we can have any number of variations of several levels of headings within numerous types of containers (think sections within articles within sections…).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here is a quick example (copied from the Mozilla blog post about the article) of how <code>-moz-any()</code> works. Instead of writing:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
<code>section section h1, section article h1, section aside h1,
section nav h1, article section h1, article article h1,
article aside h1, article nav h1, aside section h1,
aside article h1, aside aside h1, aside nav h1, nav section h1,
nav article h1, nav aside h1, nav nav h1, {
    font-size: 24px;
}
</code>
</pre>
                            <p>
                                You could simply write:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
<code>-moz-any(section, article, aside, nav) h1 {
    font-size: 24px;
}
</code>
</pre>
                            <p>
                                Nice, huh?

                                Some are of the opinion that form elements shouldn’t be styled at all, since a user might not recognise them as such if they don’t match the operating system’s controls. I partially agree: I’d rather put the choice in the hands of designers and expect them to be capable of deciding whether their particular design hampers or improves usability.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I would say the same idea applies to <code>font-face</code>: while some fear designers might go crazy and litter their web pages with dozens of different fonts, most welcome the freedom to use something other than Arial or Verdana.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There will always be someone who will take this freedom too far, but it would be useful if we could, for example, style the default Opera date picker:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <code>&lt;input type="date" /&gt;</code>
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                I don’t think there is one <span>CSS</span> author out there who has never come across a case where he or she wished there was a parent selector. There have been many suggestions as to how this could work, but a variation of the child selector is usually the most popular:

                                One can dream…
                            </p>
                            <h4>
                                Flexible box layout
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/">Flexible Box Layout Module</a> sounds a bit like magic: it introduces a new box model to <span>CSS</span>, allowing you to distribute and order boxes inside other boxes, and determine how the available space is shared.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Two of my favourite features of this new box model are:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>the ability to redistribute boxes in a different order from the markup
                                </li>
                                <li>the ability to create flexible layouts, where boxes shrink (or expand) to fill the available space
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Let’s take a quick look at the second case. Imagine you have a three-column layout, where the first column takes up twice as much horizontal space as the other two:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
<code>&lt;body&gt;
        &lt;section id="main"&gt;
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;section id="links"&gt;
        &lt;/section&gt;
        &lt;aside&gt;
        &lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code>
</pre>
                            <p>
                                With the flexible box model, you could specify it like this:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
<code>body {
    display: box;
    box-orient: horizontal;
}
#main {
    box-flex: 2;
}
#links {
    box-flex: 1;
}
aside {
    box-flex: 1;
}
</code>
</pre>
                            <p>
                                If you decide to add a fourth column to this layout, there is no need to recalculate units or percentages, it’s as easy as that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Browser support for this property is still in its early stages (Firefox and WebKit need their vendor prefixes), but we should start to see it being gradually introduced as more attention is drawn to it (I’m looking at you…). You can read a more comprehensive write-up about this property on the <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/04/the-css-3-flexible-box-model/">Mozilla developer blog</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s easy to understand why it’s harder to start playing with this module than with things like animations or other more decorative properties, which don’t really break your layouts when users don’t see them. But it’s important that we do, even if only in very experimental projects.

                            <p>
                                Anyone who has never wished they could do something like the following in <span>CSS</span>, cast the first stone:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
<code>article {
    h1 { font-size: 1.2em; }
    ul { margin-bottom: 1.2em; }
}
</code>
</pre>
                            <p>
                                Even though it can easily turn into a specificity nightmare and promote redundancy in your style sheets (if you abuse it), it’s easy to see how nested selectors could be useful. <span>CSS</span> compilers such as <a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less</a> or <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> let you do this already, but not everyone wants or can use these compilers in their projects.

                                Every wish list has an item that could easily be dropped. In my case, I would say this is one that I would ditch first – it’s the least useful, and also the one that could cause more maintenance problems. But it could be nice.

                            <p>
                                The <span>CSS</span> Lists module introduces the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-lists/#markers"><code>::marker</code> pseudo-element</a>, that allows you to create custom list item markers. When an element’s display property is set to <code>list-item</code>, this pseudo-element is created.

                                Bear in mind that the <span>CSS</span> Lists module is still a Working Draft and is listed as “Low priority”. I did say this wish list would start to grow more unrealistic closer to the end…
                            </p>

                                Variables
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                The sight of the word ‘variables’ may make some web designers shy away, but when you think of them applied to things such as repeated colours in your stylesheets, it’s easy to see how having variables available in <span>CSS</span> could be useful.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Think of a website where the main brand colour is applied to elements like the main text, headings, section backgrounds, borders, and so on. In a particularly large website, where the colour is repeated countless times in the <span>CSS</span> and where it’s important to keep the colour consistent, using variables would be ideal (some big websites are already doing this by using server-side technology).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Again, Less and Sass allow you to use variables in your <span>CSS</span> but, <em>again</em>, not everyone can (or wants to) use these.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you are using Less, you could, for instance, set the <code>font-family</code> value in one variable, and simply call that variable later in the code, instead of repeating the complete font stack, like so:
                            </p>
                            <pre>

body {
    font-family: @fontFamily;

                                Other features of these <span>CSS</span> compilers might also be useful, like the ability to ‘call’ a property value from another selector (accessors):
                            </p>
                            <pre>

footer {
    background: header['background'];

</pre>
                            <p>
                                or the ability to define functions (with arguments), saving you from writing large blocks of code when you need to write something like, for example, a <span>CSS</span> gradient:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
<code>.gradient (@start:"", @end:"") {
    background: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, from(@start), to(@end));
    background: -moz-linear-gradient(-90deg,@start,@end);

button {
    .gradient(#D0D0D0,#9F9F9F);

                                Each <span>CSS</span> author has his or her own style for commenting their style sheets. While this isn’t a massive problem on smaller projects, where maybe only one person will edit the <span>CSS</span>, in larger scale projects, where dozens of hands touch the code, it would be nice to start seeing a more standardised way of commenting.

                                One attempt at creating a standard for <span>CSS</span> comments is <a href="http://cssdoc.net/"><span>CSSDOC</span></a>, an adaptation of Javadoc (a documentation generator that extracts comments from Java source code into <span>HTML</span>). <span>CSSDOC</span> uses ‘DocBlocks’, a term borrowed from the <a href="http://www.phpdoc.org/">phpDocumentor Project</a>. A DocBlock is a human- and machine-readable block of data which has the following structure:

                                I understand that if even some of these were implemented in browsers now, it would be a long time until all vendors were up to speed. But if we don’t talk about them and experiment with what’s available, then it will definitely never happen.
