                                The New Yorker's Nick Paumgarten had a tough time <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/20/101220fa_fact_paumgarten#ixzz18Oj2IZV6">securing an interview</a> with Nintendo's resident genius, Shigeru Miyamoto. Here's why:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    The corporate ethos in Japan, and especially at Nintendo, is self-effacing; the humility that has kept Miyamoto at the company for three decades, rather than in, say, Silicon Valley, seeking his billions, also governs the apportionment of credit. Miyamoto has been a superstar in the gaming world for more than two decades, but neither he nor the company seems inclined to exploit his stardom. They contend that the development of a game or a game console is a collaborative effort â€” that it is indecorous to single out any one contributor, to the exclusion of the others.
                                </p>

                            <p>
                                Japan also has <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/07/ceo_pay_in_japan.html">very low CEO pay</a>. When we talk about inequality, and income inequality, we don't talk enough about social norms, perhaps because they present questions we don't really have answers to.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So let's talk about them a bit. The argument that holds among American elites -- in part because there's <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/12/the-newest-and-best-data-on-income-inequality.html">some evidence</a> to support it, and in part because it's good for them to believe it -- is that it's inefficient for rich people to make less money, because that will reduce their incentives to employ people and create things, and that will end up making all of us worse off. The same argument is applied to taxing the money they make, of course.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The argument that appears to hold in Japan is that it's indecent for rich people to make too much money because, after all, these are collaborative endeavors. And so they don't make that much money, and they appear to be okay with that. America was also closer to this philosophy 50 years ago. In 1969, for instance, the average CEO made 26 times what the average worker made. Today, it's closer to 500 times.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Perhaps there's evidence that Japanese corporations endure much worse management than American corporations, but that's not my understanding. Rather, I wonder if the social beliefs may actually be self-fulfilling. Miyamoto isn't pissed off because Nintendo won't give him more money. The CEO of Toyota isn't furious about his pay package. But if they subscribed to the American ethos, those things would bother them, and they'd either leave their companies or retire earlier or work less hard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I think the answer an American economist might give to this is that it'd be <em>good</em> if Miyamoto had gone to Silicon Valley to seek his billions, but that gets harder to prove if you imagine an equilibrium in which the best people aren't going to Silicon Valley. The Wii was pretty innovative. But that's neither here nor there: The main point is that once you've let the social norms out of the bottle, it's not clear how you get them back in. And if you can't get them back in, it's hard to imagine imposing policy that'll get you back there anyway. In other words, the norms account for the policies on pay, not the other way around.
