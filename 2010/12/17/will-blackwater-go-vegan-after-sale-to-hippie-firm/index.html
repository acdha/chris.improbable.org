                            <p>
                                <a rel="attachment wp-att-37548" href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/12/will-blackwater-go-vegan-after-sale-to-hippy-firm/blackwaterhellokittylove_2-300x266-2/"><img title="blackwaterhellokittylove_2-300x266" src="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/2010/12/blackwaterhellokittylove_2-300x266.gif" alt="" width="300" height="266"></a>The next time you sink into the tub after a stressful day, your relaxation illuminated by the plume of the soy candle you bought at Whole Foods, know this: you are funding the world’s most infamous private security company.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Long on the <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/06/vote-who-should-buy-blackwater/">auction block</a>, Blackwater/Xe <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/blackwater-founder-in-deal-to-sell-company/?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">has finally been sold</a>, Dealbook reports, to a team of investors led by Forté Capital Advisors and Manhattan Growth Partners for an estimated $200 million. The first of those investors should come as no surprise: Forte’s Jason DeYonker is a confidante of the family of company founder Erik Prince. But the second, well — sorry, hippies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                War is Business <a href="http://www.warisbusiness.com/2010/12/the-blackwater-vegan-soap-connection/">does some digging</a> and finds that Manhattan Growth Partners likes to put its money in the crunchier side of the consumer-goods market. Among its investments: organic beauty company Hugo Naturals, which pledges only to use “<a href="http://hugonaturals.com/organic_vegan_care_products/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=187&amp;Itemid=155">the highest quality vegan, natural, organic and kosher food-grade ingredients.</a>” It’s their scrubs and lotions you bought at Whole Foods. Now that their moneymen have a piece of Blackwater, can it be long before the high-priced market stocks organic <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/09/aint-no-party-like-a-blackwater-party-cause-a-blackwater-party-got-coke-roids-and-aks/">steroids and cocaine</a>?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well, probably, yeah. But it remains to be seen how much of a rebranding the company will undergo after the sale. As Dealbook points out, Prince has hinted that in order to get rid of the taint of Nisour Square — in which Blackwater security guards protecting U.S. diplomats <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/12/feds-issue-indi/">killed 17 Iraqi civilians in a confusing 2007 melee in Baghdad</a> — the company will make training military forces and law enforcement the core of its business. But one of its partnerships recently won part of a <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/10/exclusive-blackwater-wins-piece-of-10-billion-merc-deal/">huge State Department contract for protecting diplomats</a>. And with a <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/12/army-set-to-award-mega-contract-to-train-afghan-cops/">huge Army deal to train Afghan police soon to be awarded</a>, it’s possible that the New-Look Blackwater will find the Prince era teed up its future quite naturally. DeYonker has yet to return a request for comment, and a vague statement from the new investors, USTC Holdings, doesn’t clarify.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And if the deal shows anything, it shows that the branding problems the company has — renaming itself “Xe” in 2009 earned it ridicule and didn’t fool anyone — conceal how large the market is for its services. Training foreign armies and police forces might be a core function of the U.S. military in an era of insurgents and terrorists, as <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66224/robert-m-gates/helping-others-defend-themselves">Defense Secretary Robert Gates advocates</a>, but the military would rather fight people, as evidenced by the fact that it hasn’t built an institutional command for foreign partner training. That’s where contractors come in.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Same thing with guarding diplomats and aid workers, a task the military decidedly does not want. While Blackwater may have a<a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/10/you-can-shoot-people-take-drugs-and-still-win-big-govt-contracts/">long list of misdeeds to its name</a>, getting its charges killed is not one of them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Still, should the company really want to get under the skin of its liberal critics, it now has an inroads to do some serious greenwashing.
