                            <br>
                            In last years 'State of the Coalition' (of Networked Information), <a href="http://vimeo.com/8347035">Clifford Lynch highlighted four points</a>:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Archives and special collections/memory organizations have long been largely privatized (ex Genealogy.com, ancestry.com, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btjPbRFaK24">world vital records</a> [pepsi]) momentum in private archivisation, began with hardcore genealogy, now, to document your family, upload photos, movies, diaries, or audio recordings, (ex. <a href="http://www.magnes.org/">Magnes museum</a>A museum containing Jewish history) is becoming more common. Many new (public) players (<a href="http://www.npr.org/series/4516989/storycorps">storycorps</a> [aural histories], public organizations like BBC, and others moving into <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/98272/The-pacifists-who-went-to-war-violence-and-pacifism-in-a-world-of-war">large scale public oral history</a>)
                                </li>
                                <li>The future is heavily multimedia. (ex data on digital images, vs behavior with film photography, the notion that one will get hundreds of thousands of photos from a wide array of people) this is a sharp shift away from seeing images/motion images as esoteric, also, expect less "described" sets of information. What used to be a "specialty problem" - now almost all archiving operations will encounter issues of this sort.
                                </li>
                                <li>Deposit agreements; transfer of things into a special collection/archive Needing to think about what goes into deeds of gift. Considering accidental uncovering of embarrassing or sensitive information. Some examples; many people don't think about exactly HOW MUCH can be 'uncovered' from an average persons computer (browser histories etc). This suggests a need to have a relationship of trust between a 'donor' and the archivist. Suggestion; some standardized models for a gift/deed/will.
                                </li>
                                <li>Strategic point. Waiting until people die before reaching out to families will be an increasingly ineffectual tactic, especially in a "cloud" based, impermanent cyberspace. Digitally intestate (forgetting to pass on a password/login/ account info....) Perhaps reaching out earlier, during lives to request a "promise/will" for full access to the "web/document" presence of a person. But... when do you start? The national library of wales; <a href="http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=498">part of their mission is to capture the welsh literature.</a> Reaching out early in the careers of welsh writers, this is do-able for an enterprise on this smaller scale, but how does this work in a larger scale research library, do we start reaching out to begin relationships with young people as they are "up and coming"... Who fits this category?
                                </li>
                            </ol>It could get less and less practical to fully document the entire digital lives of certain individuals. What are some ways memory companies can innovate/drive archivists, conceptually. We are all archivists now.<br>

The interviews are organized below (don't miss <a href="http://vimeo.com/18025749">this years update from Clifford Lynch</a>, as he looks back at some CNI history, and also shares some of the most fascinating up and coming projects and details to do with Networked Information, data preservation and all that goes with that [a very interesting point he makes is that new initiatives requiring public science projects to include specific plans for data preservation and sharing, <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/">like the new NIH policies</a>, are not asking for [thoroughly unrealistic] 'infinite' preservation, but rather, the much more realistic goal of five year storage, allowing for format migration, and analysis of data value.<br>
