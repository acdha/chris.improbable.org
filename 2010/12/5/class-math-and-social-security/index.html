                                Paul Krugman comments on DC’s endless fascination <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/04/class-and-social-security/">with Social Security cuts</a>:
                            </p>

                                    <strong>When medical expenses are big, they’re big; even the very affluent are grateful when Medicare pays the bills for their mother-in-laws bypass or dialysis</strong>. The importance of Medicare, in short, is obvious to all but the very rich.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Social Security, by contrast, is something that matters enormously to the bottom half of the income distribution, but no so much to people in the 250K-plus club. A 30 percent cut in benefits would represent disaster for tens of millions of Americans, but a barely noticeable inconvenience for VSPs and everyone they know</strong>. A rise in the retirement age would be a vast hardship for people who do manual labor, but if anything a gift to VSPs, who don’t want to step aside in any case. And so on down the line.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So <strong>going after Social Security is a way to seem tough and serious — but entirely at the expense of people you don’t know</strong>.

                                Here’s a chart from the <a href="http://www.ourfiscalsecurity.org/fiscal-blueprint/">Our Fiscal Future report</a> that makes the point:
                            </p>
                            <center>
                                <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/socialsecurity-2.jpg"><img src="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/socialsecurity-2.jpg" alt="" title="socialsecurity 2" width="500" height="374"></a>
                            </center>
                            <p>
                                Even though Social Security is only a very mildly redistributive program, inequality of wealth is such that it’s a vital element of the bottom 60 percent’s living standards but kind of small beer to the top twenty percent. But I would say the other thing here on the Medicare / Social Security contrast is that Medicare isn’t just a subsidy program for old people. It’s also a subsidy program for doctors, nurses, hospital administrators, pharmaceutical executives, etc. Those people have lobbyists, many of their professions are well-respected, and many members of the political/media elite have siblings, cousins, college buddies, and even spouses who work in those fields.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The tragedy is that this very same factor that makes it harder to cut Medicare is also why cutting Social Security is a much worse idea. Our health care sector is low productivity mess and there are a lot of health-improving things a low-income senior can buy with Social Security money but can’t buy with Medicare. Healthy food, a gym membership, home-repair, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But there is a flipside to Krugman’s point here, namely that you could in fact trim Social Security benefits for wealthier Americans without causing them much harm. Conversely, if it were possible to <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/11/addressing-social-securitys-adequacy-problem/">address Social Security’s adequacy problem by boosting benefits at the bottom end</a> you’d do an enormous amount to improve living standards. It’s kind of absurd that such a large share of federal spending goes to income support for the elderly and yet 10 percent of our seniors live below the poverty line.
