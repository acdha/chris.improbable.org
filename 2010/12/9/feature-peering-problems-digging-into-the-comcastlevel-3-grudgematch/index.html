                                Is Comcast really trying to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/11/how-comcast-became-a-toll-collecting-hydra-with-a-nuke.ars">wreck the open Internet with a set of new tollbooths</a>? Is Level 3 <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/12/comcast-we-bent-over-backwards-to-help-level-3-those-bastards.ars">really trying to browbeat its way to a good deal</a>?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ever since the Comcast/Level 3 interconnection dispute broke wide open into public view last week, the accusations from both sides have been flying. Sorting out those accusations has been difficult, in part because it was just so hard to know, on a technical level, what exactly has been going on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/09/peering-and-transit.ars">Peering and transit issues</a> can be notoriously complex but also murky, the details hidden behind nondisclosure agreements. As the <a href="http://www.nanog.org/meetings/nanog47/presentations/Monday/Labovitz_ObserveReport_N47_Mon.pdf">2009 Annual Report</a> (PDF) from the ATLAS Internet Observatory put it, such deals are "difficult to quantify due to NDA/commercial privacy."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One upside of the dispute is that some of this secrecy has been lifted, and both sides have been unusually open with the press and with regulators about how they interact and what they believe to be at stake. If Level 3 is right, Comcast is trying to do nothing less than turn every Tier 1 network in the US into its customer, rather than the other way round. The result: a fundamental shift in network economics, and the beginning of an era in which the major ISPs start throwing their weight around, making it almost impossible for content companies to reach customers without paying each ISP an additional fee for direct network access. In this view, it's no coincidence that the big ISPs like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;T all operate content businesses of their own, including cable TV, video on demand, and IPTV.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If Comcast is right, Level 3 simply got in over its head and offered cut-rate pricing to Netflix in order to deliver the company's streaming video; now it needs to secure an unbelievable deal in order make the number work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                More fundamentally, the entire controversy is a reminder that there are no hard-and-fast rules about network interconnection; indeed, the increasingly complex nature of these interconnection deals means that it's not always clear, even to the participants, who should be paying whom. Traffic flows alone don't tell the story; it's all about perceived value. Now that "eyeball" networks like Comcast and "content" networks like Level 3 or Akamai have established deeply asymmetrical connections and traffic is often out of balance, should the content networks pay? As a <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1374285">2008 paper</a> from MIT and Akamai noted, "The question of who should pay whom to recover the costs of supporting that interconnection is ambiguous in this asymmetric world."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There's no better public example of that ambiguity than the Level 3/Comcast mudfight.

                                        It's complicated: a variety of ways that two networks can connect
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                Some background
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Prior to this dispute, Comcast and Level 3 had a longstanding, two-part relationship: they exchanged both free and paid traffic. Because Level 3 operates an Internet backbone, Comcast paid the company for true Internet "transit"â€”getting access to all the other networks with which Comcast had no direct interconnection. If a Comcast customer entered bbc.co.uk into her browser, for instance, that request could pass over Level 3's network and would be routed to the BBC's computers; traffic from the BBC could return on the same path. To make this work, Level 3 and Comcast had direct port-to-port network connections at various locations in the US.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But not all of the traffic passing across these connections was paid transit. Level 3 also operates a content delivery network (CDN) to provide cached (and therefore faster) access to streaming video and other content. If a Comcast customer tried to watch one of these videos, that request would then go to Level 3's network and would terminate there. The video that was returned would be handed to Comcast, and would be sent on to the user who requested it without leaving the network.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These two kinds of traffic ("on-net" and "off-net") were treated differently, even though they passed over the same interconnection points. Comcast paid Level 3 for off-net transit traffic, but Level 3 and Comcast exchanged on-net traffic without charging one another (called "settlement-free peering").
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Who paid for the delivery of all this on-net traffic, then? The customers. In Level 3's case, this means that CDN customers like Netflix would pay Level 3, while Comcast's cable modem subscribers would pay Comcast. Very simple, very clean, and according to Level 3 now, this is the way the Internet <em>should be</em> connected.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But after winning the Netflix deal this autumn, Level 3 suddenly wanted to pass far more traffic over its links with Comcast. Comcast balked; Level 3 suddenly looked less like a transit vendor and more like a CDN. Comcast began talking about the imbalance in the two companies' traffic ratios and then demanded a fee from Level 3 for the traffic being dumped onto its network. (Indeed, Comcast's public <a href="http://www.comcast.com/peering/">peering policy</a> states, "Applicant must maintain a traffic scale between its network and Comcast that enables a general balance of inbound versus outbound traffic.")

                                Comcast says that it didn't have the necessary 10 GigE ports available to meet's Level 3's demand, though it managed to dig up "customer" ports it could charge Level 3 to use. But Level 3 had never been a "customer" of Comcast before; the relationship had always been the other way round. Now, Comcast claimed that, due the traffic imbalance between the two, Level 3 had to become both a transit vendor and a paid peering customer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Level 3 objected, arguing that it wasn't increasing Comcast's costs with the extra traffic. The company tells me that it actually offered to give the necessary hardware to Comcast (at around $50,000 per port) and that it offered to do "cold-potato" routing deep into Comcast's network, dropping off streaming traffic near the customers who requested it, for instance. This would save Comcast money, since the cable giant wouldn't have to sling this streaming traffic across the country on its own network. Comcast said that wasn't good enough; it wanted cash.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Level 3 felt trapped. It could "just take it" or it could "take it and complain," the company's legal counsel John Ryan told me. It chose the latter.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "It's not about the money that we're now being forced to pay Comcast," he added. It's about the precedent.. and what it might have to pay in the future.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Routing around Comcast?
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Like every ISP, Comcast has a monopoly on access to its subscribers, called a "terminating access monopoly." That is, there's no other way to reach those subscribers except to pass through the ISP's last-mile networkâ€”and to do so on the ISP's terms. Terminating access monopolies don't necessarily pose problems, but the <em>potential</em> for problems is there. This monopoly is at the heart of the Level 3/Comcast dispute that erupted into public last week, when Level 3 accused the cable giant of erecting new "tollbooths" on the Internet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If Netflix wants to use a CDN, it has several excellent choices, including Level 3, LimeLight, and Akamai. If Comcast needs to buy transit, it can do so from several excellent providers (and in fact Comcast uses more than one transit link already, including both Level 3 and Tata). And despite too-limited competition, many US Internet users still have at least two options for buying access. But when Netflix and Level 3 need to reach Comcast customers, they have a single optionâ€”Comcast.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As Level 3 put it in a lengthy document released last week:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    There is vigorous and active competition among Internet backbone providers. It is very easy for one Internet backbone to send its traffic across any number of other Internet backbones. It's a little like driving across the US. There are many routes you can choose to get from one city to another.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Unlike the Internet backbone, there is limited competition when it comes to Internet access at the home or business. The local access connections are generally dominated by two providers: the local phone company and the local cable company. Both sets of companies generally developed their dominant positions by virtue of exclusive government franchises that protected them from competition. While Comcast and others talk about theoretical competition from broadband cellular or broadband over power line, for almost all Americans, broadband to the home means service from either the cable or phone company. Anyone who believes that broadband wireless is a substitute for the broadband access services provided by cable and phone companies should try connecting their cell phone to their TV to try to watch an online movie or TV show...
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Unlike "peering" in the Internet backbone, where competition abounds and prices have been declining steadily, Internet carriers that have content requested by Comcast subscribers have no choice but to exchange traffic with Comcast. Comcast is using this dominant position to demand payment for traffic delivered at its customers' requests. You simply cannot "route around" Comcast to provide requested content to Comcast's subscribers.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                This last bit, about "routing around" Comcast, is of course true, though Level 3 does make it sound like it must agree to Comcast's fees in order to get its CDN traffic onto Comcast's network. This isn't quite accurate, though it may be a functional requirement for a CDN. As Time Warner put it last week when it came to Comcast's defense, "regardless of whether two Network Operators reach an agreement, end users will still be able to receive any data or content they wish to reach as that traffic will find an alternate route over other available interconnecting networks." Comcast does maintain transit links that all non-interconnected networks can use to reach Comcast subscribers, and Level 3 could use these without striking a Comcast deal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Still, most serious content owners bypass transit in favor or directly-connected CDNs. Why? Transit links don't always put content close to subscribers, for one thing, but they can also be heavily congested and offer a poor experience for the sustained throughput needed for (say) streaming video.

                                Some charge that Comcast keeps its transit ports jammed up on purpose, in order to force deep-pocketed content providers to interconnect directly on Comcast's terms. That's the contention of people like Voxel's Adam Rothschild, who <a href="http://www.voxel.net/blog/2010/12/peering-disputes-comcast-level-3-and-you">wrote on his blog</a> last week:

                                    As was the case with Level 3, Comcast purchases commodity IP transit service from Tata, as a means of reaching networks it doesnâ€™t maintain direct peering relationships with. Unlike Level 3 though, Comcast runs its ports to Tata at capacity, deliberately, as a means of degrading connectivity to networks which wonâ€™t peer with them or pay them money.
                                </p>

                                    Speaking off the record and respecting customer confidentiality, a Tata executive confirms, succinctly: "[our] San Jose and New York links with Comcast are running full."

                                Comcast insists that transit remains useful. As VP Joe Waz put it this week, "Every providerâ€”including Level 3, right at this very momentâ€”has the option of sending traffic to Comcast by using one of the many transit provider networks that are available. Indeed, some of Level 3's competitors do exactly thatâ€”they interconnect with us for some traffic, and they send traffic to us through other 'transit' providers as well. Because the Internet is an interconnected network of networks, there are literally hundreds of ways for traffic to get from any source to our network, through providers with whom we have all different kinds of relationships."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the odd thing about this statement is that, if Level 3 decided just to send all its traffic over transit instead, it would cost Comcast money. Peering is much cheaper than transit, which is a key reason peering arose in the first place. As one of our own writers, who has extensive experience with Internet routing, put it to me, "Forcing traffic over transit that Level 3 is happy to deliver locally over peering means that Comcast is being disingenuous in some way. It costs them more money and it delivers worse service to their customers. You only do that to make a point. Normally, you have transit to reach destinations that you can't reach over peering."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And what point would that be? Why, that ISPs are players in the game. The 2008 paper mentioned above includes a helpful chart about what companies might be willing to peer with one another in the brave new world in which we find ourselves; as the chart below shows, Comcast will be less willing to do free peering with a CDN like Level 3, though Level 3 will of course want free peering with Comcast.

                                The reason: "[Large eyeball networks] believe they have bargaining power over content providers, large and small, under the assumption that eyeball customers are less vulnerable to switching to another access provider than are [content networks]." Netflix can and will go elsewhere in a moment, but Bill Shoomkin of Schaumburg won't drop Comcast over these business disputes that don't concern him.

                                In other words, ISPs with eyeballs want to monetize those eyeballs. But why is Level 3 complaining about it?
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                A new world
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                In large part, the complaint comes because the practice of "paid peering" is relatively new, and Level 3 wants to prevent such fees from becoming the new norm. Some of my own sources in the industry indicate that Comcast has become well-known in the last few years for its aggressive approach to interconnection, and for trying to charge CDNs who want such a direct connection. Indeed, Comcast last week indicated that its Level 3 charges weren't an anomaly and that other CDNs had already paid up.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But Level 3 says that the charges are a dangerous outlier. The company's backbone is one of the world's largest, so it connects to plenty of other networks; still, Level 3 tells me that this is the first time it has been charged simply to access another networkâ€”that is, charged to deliver the content requested by that network's users. Other CDNs may well pay the fees, though John Ryan expressed near disbelief that any are paying just for <em>access</em> to Comcast's customers. Instead, they may be paying for transit, routing their traffic across the country to get it where it's needed, or paying ISPs to take on this data hauling themselves. But Level 3 has a huge fiber footprint in the US; it can localize its CDN traffic and dump it at regional Comcast connection points, so it doesn't need transit services.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Level 3 is also willing to pay something for interconnection to compensate other networks for more ports or backhaul or other infrastructure. But what it will do only under public protest is pay ongoing fees simply for delivering on-net trafficâ€”that is, for accessâ€”traffic ratios be damned. Ryan, clearly not feeling well disposed toward Comcast at the moment, suspects the company would still try to charge him even if he delivered traffic right to every user's local node.

                            <p>
                                Comcast insists the such upfront infrastructure payments aren't enough, and it has much to say about out-of-balance traffic ratios; that is, Level 3 is dumping far more traffic onto Comcast than Comcast sends to Level 3. As Comcast's Joe Waz put it this week:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>

                                    When Level 3 has beenâ€”in its own wordsâ€”"one of the top two global Internet backbones in the world" and a provider of "high speed access to larger enterprises," it presumably transported a roughly equal balance of traffic in both directions (between different networks and to and from its own enterprise customers) consistent with industry peering practices. But since CDNs typically send far more traffic than they receive, Level 3 suddenly finds itself in a different businessâ€”one in which its new job will consist almost entirely of sending traffic to other networks. That's it in a nutshellâ€”Level 3 wants to change its business, and therefore it wants to change the entire global framework of peering relationships to suit its needs. Now that Level 3 realizes it might for the first time be at the sending side of a traffic imbalance, it has decided that the rules of the game are all wrong. What a surprise.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>

                                Level 3, of course, says that it's Comcast who wants to change the rules of the game. While "peering" agreements are usually made only in cases where traffic ratios are roughly equal (less than 2:1, in most cases), Level 3 doesn't seem to think that it "peers" with Comcast at all, at least not in the old sense. What we have here is a failure to communicate, or even to agree on definitions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Peering is a form of interconnection, traditionally used to describe Internet backbones that exchanged traffic without payment, but now used more broadly to talk about any two networks that directly connect, whether or not fees are paid. In this case, Level 3 wants to dump most of its content onto Comcast at the request of Comcast's residential subscribers. It complains that Comcast wants to "apply a traditional backbone 'peering' concept to this dispute" in order to use the traffic ratios issue to basically mint money.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As for those ratios, Level 3 says they're a relic of an older world. In the new world, they will <em>necessarily</em> be out of balance at least when it comes to Comcast's residential customers; they are on asymmetrical pipes that privilege downloading, and it takes only a tiny bit of data to request a massive video stream. Comcast says that, with Level 3's addition of Netflix in the new year, the traffic ratios will be as high as 5:1. The question is whether this matters. Every CDN operation will have such imbalances thanks to the traffic being delivered, and they all want direct connections to Comcast. If Comcast charges for these connections as though they are backbone peering agreements, what happens as video quality on the 'Net climbs and ratios grow ever more lopsided? If in the future Level 3 sends 50x more traffic to Comcast than it does now, will it have to pay 50x what Comcast wants now?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The issue of ratios and cost is a tricky one. As we noted in our <a href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/09/peering-and-transit.ars">2008 guide to peering and transit</a>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    It's a common misconception that the benefit an ISP derives from peering depends upon the direction of the flow of traffic. According to this way of thinking, if YouTube peers with an ISP, this benefits YouTube more than it does the ISP (since YouTube sends so much data but receives comparatively little). But in practice, the flow of traffic is not an issue for an interconnect. Whether it goes to or from the network, companies still need the same Cisco equipment.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In practice, it is actually quite likely that the ISP side of an ISP-YouTube relationship would see the greatest savings both in absolute costs and as a percentage of total traffic costs. Most ISPs have less traffic (and buy less transit) than YouTube and its parent Google have. Their buying power therefore is less than that of YouTube/Google, so their price per Mbps/month for transit is likely to be higher. Given that the amount of traffic saved from transit is by definition equal for both YouTube and the ISP, it follows that the ISP is saving more money.
                                </p>

                                Given this situation, Level 3 essentially wants an end to paid peeringâ€”at least in situations where the CDN can deliver content locally.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As Level 3 put it in (yet another) press release, "We said in 2005, and still say today, that simple traffic ratios are only one indicator of the additional capacity that IP backbone providers must install as customer traffic grows... The capacity that Level 3 and Comcast must add to their respective IP backbones is determined by the distance each company carries the traffic. When IP backbone companies have a dispute, it is fundamentally about this issue... Level 3 has and continues to offer to use its own IP backbone to carry content right to the edge of the Comcast local Internet access markets where the substantial majority of Comcastâ€™s customers reside."

                                In my misguided youth, I spent a year as a chemistry major. This year largely consisted of learning about concepts that, it was made clear, weren't strictly accurate; they were simplifications to help us grasp fundamental ideas, but the true mind-blowing reality would have to wait for upper-level courses.
                            </p>

                                In the same way, everything we've been saying above is something of a simplification. For instance, Comcast isn't just a provider a home broadband services. In the last three years, the company has moved beyond its cable roots to establish a major presence as an Internet backbone and to sell wholesale connectivity and transit service to other networks. Indeed, a recent presentation to the North American Network Operator' Group (NANOG) shows just how much Comcast has changed since 2007.

                                As for Level 3, it has also changed in the last few years, growing beyond the Internet backbone business to become a CDN player as well. Thus, it's a bit simplified to envision both companies using easy categories like "access network" and "backbone network," with the result that key questions have become murkier. Who is a "customer" of whom? When do two networks "peer," and do the old conditions for peering still hold? Which network needs the other network more?

                                    Level 3 desperately wants to define Comcast as mainly an 'access' network, but that's like saying a baseball team is mainly the catcher. Comcast operates a nationwide multi-service high speed network with residential, business, and wholesale customers, and its operations include a very robust backbone network. Neither Level 3 nor Comcast serve only end-user 'eyeballs.' We have a range of commercial customers who use Comcast's network for transit across the Internet, including video content providers, Content Delivery Networks, software companies, Web hosters, universities, town offices, local schools, smaller MSOs [cable companies], and others. Indeed, Comcast and Level 3 are comparable networks with comparable costsÂ…

                                    Does some provider, somewhere down the line, have to interconnect with Comcast, to get traffic to a Comcast customer? Sure. But it is equally true that if you want to reach one of Level 3's enterprise customers, you have to work through your own or a third party's direct interconnection with Level 3. In other words: there's no difference.

But it's doing so now, throwing bombs in the networking community and trying to drag the FCC into the case. To date, Level 3 tells me it has spoken with the head of the FCC's Wireline Competition Bureau (as has Comcast). It has sought a discussion with FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski and the other commissioners. And it has gone to Congress, speaking with various members and their staffers.

Probably notâ€”just look at this dispute, in which the parties have gone into truly unusual levels of detail about their operations and economic arrangements. At bottom, the two sides contend that the other is trying to change long-established norms for interconnection, or that those old norms no longer apply in a changed world.

                                Level 3 insists that CDNs who can bring their traffic to Comcast's virtual door shouldn't pay for mere network access. Comcast insists that they should, regardless of who requested that traffic or where it's going; if CDNs don't want to pay, they're welcome to use the "open Internet" by coming in through transit links.
