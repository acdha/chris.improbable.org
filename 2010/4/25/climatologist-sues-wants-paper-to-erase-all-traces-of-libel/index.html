                            <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/04/climatologist-sues-for-libel-demands-copyright-of-articles.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss"><img vspace="4" hspace="4" border="0" align="right" src="http://static.arstechnica.com/assets/2010/04/kitten_newspaper_earth_ars-thumb-230x130-13627-f.jpg"></a>
                            <p>
                                It's probably an unfortunate measure of the quality of modern journalism that few of us would be surprised to hear that an editorial on a politically controversial topic contained significant factual inaccuracies. But climate change seems to have reached the point where even some apparent facts have become points of contention, and at least some reporters have become comfortable with simply <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/01/why-is-the-news-media-comfortable-with-lying-about-science.ars">making things up</a> and ascribing their imaginings to credible scientific sources. Apparently fed up with similar practices in editorials produced by Canada's <em>National Post</em>, a climatologist has now sued the publisher for libel and defamation. But the suit seeks a judgement that's remarkably sweeping: the scientist wants the publisher to hand over the copyright to the editorials so he can attempt to erase them from the Internet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are really two stories here, and we'll discuss each separately.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                The accusations and evidence
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The plaintiff in the case is <a href="http://climate.uvic.ca/people/weaver/">Andrew Weaver</a> of the University of Victoria, who contributed to the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.htm">2007 IPCC report</a>&nbsp;and has written a book on climate change for the Canadian market. Weaver has made a number of appearances in the popular press, and has been interviewed and quoted both in print and on television, so he has acted as a bit of a spokesman for the wider scientific community on this issue. And that, not surprisingly, has made him a target of those who feel there's something badly off with the scientific consensus.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But, according to the suit filed by Weaver, some of the commentary that appeared in the <em>National Post</em> and its associated publications veered from criticism into malice and libel. The business, its publisher, editors, writers, and four unidentified individuals (they're named individually as "Doe, Roe, Poe, and Yoe") are all named as defendants, and the suit lays out a series of accusations based on several editorials that have graced the websites hosted by the <em>National Post</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anyone who has followed some of the commentary on climate change from the more partisan publications wouldn't be surprised by the language used here. The editorials decry "The spinning from the climate industry in the wake of Climategate," and name Weaver "Canada's warmist spinner-in-chief." Weaver's interest in publicly discussing climate change was ascribed to his need to chase grants, and readers are advised to "Follow the money!"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the editorials also make a series of factual statements about both Weaver and climatology, and the suit slams those as having no basis in actual facts. In terms of science, the text repeats <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/10/talk-of-global-cooling-based-on-bogus-statistics.ars">the claim</a> that temperature increases have stalled; the suit notes that, "The allegation that the annual global mean temperatures stopped increasing during the last decade has no basis in reality." The <em>National Post</em> refers to the "now-debunked hockey stick" of climate reconstructions when further studies have <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/04/climate-reconstructions-get-more-accurate.ars">continued to show</a> a similar pattern of warming.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The same sort of disregard, the suit alleges, extended to Weaver himself. The <em>Post</em> claims he accused the oil industry of being behind break-ins at his office; Weaver says he did not. It alleges an editorial was a response to recent events, when it had been prepared months in advance. Weaver is accused of "heading for the exits" and calling for changes in the IPCC leadership, when he explicitly told a reporter he was doing nothing of the sort.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On their own, this large compendium of errors would seem to be unusual, but Weaver's suit alleges that, collectively, they amount to libel. An "ordinary, reasonable reader" would infer "the plaintiff is untrustworthy, unscientific, and incompetent," according to the suit, and would reach the following conclusions about Weaver: "the plaintiff has engaged in a pattern of deceptive conduct in the news media"; "the plaintiff engages in willful manipulation and distortion of scientific data for the purpose of deceiving the public"; and "the plaintiff is so strongly motivated by a corrupt interest in receiving government funding that he willfully conceals scientific climate data."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It could potentially be an interesting case. Like the UK, Canada allows fair comment, provided the comments are&nbsp;based on fact&nbsp;and&nbsp;not malicious. It's possible that the casual approach to scientific information displayed in the editorials could become a line of evidence indicating that the <em>National Post</em> displayed a malicious disregard for accuracy.
                            </p>
                            <div>

                            <h3>
                                Climatologist vs. the Internet
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                But the suit contains accusations of libel and maliciousness that are targeted at the standard practices of many websites (including Ars), such as allowing user comments and encouraging readers to alert their friends of the stories. So, for example, the publisher is accused of libeling Weaver by playing host to a long series of false statements that were posted to the site by its readership as part of a discussion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The common "share this" features that many sites rely on to increase traffic are also mentioned in the suit. Anyone who has followed the public arguments over climate change would fully expect that the text in question would also appear on the usual collection of blogs (with names like "climatehoax" and "climatechangefraud") run by the community that considers itself to be climate skeptics. The suit alleges that the publisher "knew, intended, and expected" that its defamatory material "would be republished by third parties on the Internet." The evidence here? Links at the bottom of the online versions of the stories, inviting readers to e-mail the contents to friends or share them via social networking services like Facebook.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Online expression may&nbsp;also&nbsp;take a hit if the proposed sanctions in the case are accepted. Most of the remedies are fairly standard—four types of damages, a full retraction, and a published report indicating the results of the legal action. The offending documents would be taken down, as well. But from the expected, the proposed sanctions veer rapidly into the surreal. The <em>National Post</em> licenses its content, and puts it into databases like Lexis-Nexis; it would have to ensure all of those copies went away, too, and work to get any cached copies hosted by search engines deleted.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And that's before Weaver goes after the skeptics' echo chamber. As part of the remedy, he wants the <em>National Post</em> to hand over the copyright to the offending works. It's strongly implied that, once in possession of the rights to these documents, Weaver will attempt to force any of the bloggers who have reproduced the text to pull it down.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By reputation, Canada's libel system makes it relatively easy for plaintiffs to succeed, even if they are public figures. And Weaver's suit appears to have documented a pattern of casual disregard for reality in the plaintiff's editorializing against him. But, even if the words are ruled defamatory, it's difficult to support the presentation of common Web practices as evidence of maliciousness, or the proposed remedies, which seek to erase any presence of the offending text.
