                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <a title="If you can't solve the problem you can at least try to minimise it..." href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/webmink/3704530692/"><img style="border:1px solid black;margin:3px 5px" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3121/3704530692_bba95b7b9f_m.jpg" border="1" alt="Handwritten sign in a French alley" hspace="5" vspace="3" width="192" height="144" align="left"></a>I spent a few days last week at a workshop with a number of other people concerned about software freedom and the law around it. One of the speakers gave a presentation about software patents, confirming that, regardless of whether software patents “as such” were permitted throughout Europe, it was easy to obtain patents on ‘inventions facilitated by software’. This reminded me that I’ve previously proposed ideas for patent reform that bear repetition. Coming back to it after three years, there was surprisingly little that needed changing so apologies if it’s not new to you (and thanks for being a regular reader!)<br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The subject of software patents is a clear one to me. I oppose software patents. They represent a profound imbalance in the social contract that justifies the granting of temporary monopolies, because they convey almost no know-how to programmers while chilling the freedom of software developers to innovate and they do so for far too long. It’s unfortunate that case-law in the US allowed this to happen; it is a disaster that trade missions have then forced other countries around the world (such as Australia) to enshrine them in law. We’re now seeing the European Commission trying to add tragedy to the situation by pressing for ACTA to criminalise patent infringement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I spent a considerable amount of time several years ago (along with Mark Webbink of Red Hat) effectively lobbying against the “CII Directive” in Europe, and I regard the absence of software patents “as such” in most of Europe as a key factor in the growth of innovation through open source over here. The software industry flourished for years without them, and they promote greedy behaviour that chills innovation and retards the evolution of the 21st century’s participative software industry.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Having said that, I am also a realist. All the time things which are effectively software patents are allowed to exist, companies risk shareholder actions if they don’t deal with them. Consequently, most companies of any size are accumulating patent portfolios that probably include software patents in some form. While the sort of absolutist idealism that many of us in the Free Software movement exhibit is laudable and provides a visionary goal, the truth is that we are far more likely to see modest reform of the patent system than a radical revision, and the elimination of software patents seems very unlikely.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So what ought to happen? What regrettable-but-pragmatic reforms are needed while we wait for the root-and-branch revision that sweeps away software patents for good? Having a list to hand in case we’re ever asked seems a good idea! If I were king (or at least an autocratic president), I’d do some or all of these:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Since most use of patents is to force licensing in an out-of-court settlement to avoid injunctive relief:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <em>Limit the availability of injunctive relief to cases of prima facie willful infringement.</em><br>
                                            It’s way too easy to get an injunction that forces your victim to stop shipping their product. Many royalty agreements come about as people settle to avoid the inevitable injunction that appears in infringement suits; it’s rare for a case to go all the way to appeals or patent invalidation. <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20070516070856610">Andy has more on this</a>. I’d also prohibit injunctive relief if patent licensing is unreasonably withheld.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <em>Make it easy for patent licensees to recover their license fees if a patent is invalidated.</em><br>
                                            The settlements people make in such cases aren’t usually affected by the invalidation of a patent later. If licensing fees had to be refunded when patents were invalidated, I believe we’d see trolls wither and die since even if their “blackmail” worked, they’d have to pay the loot back later.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>If we have to have software patents, their term and applicability needs control:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <em>Make them last no more than five years, renewable once (maybe, and only if used in products).</em><br>
                                            Timescales in the software industry are so short that anything more is effectively a lifetime patent.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <em>Make them unenforceable against ISO standards (and possibly other bodies).</em><br>
                                            There could be an exception that allows enforcement of patents declared to the standards committee during the standardisation process. That way, the mobile phone industry (which depends on such things) would be protected, standards participation would be encouraged and we would all know which “standards” to avoid.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <em>Give immunity to implementations created in clean-room conditions for interoperability.</em><br>
                                            European copyright law allows reverse engineering for purposes of interoperability. Patent law ought to allow the same sort of freedom. It makes no sense to encourage a free technology market with copyright law and allow its monopolistic taxation with patent law.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Since software patents require far less investment than other kinds, they should have a higher standard:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <em>Consider treating a failure to identify prior art more strictly.</em><br>
                                            I got slapped about last time I suggested this, so it would need some strong safeguards, but it seems to me that since the main use of patents is to extract royalties without legal review on the basis of their existence, creating a patent which is subsequently invalidated by obvious prior art ought to be penalised.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <em>Require sample code to be filed with the patent.</em><br>
                                            Software patents currently provide nothing that a programmer finds useful. They are effectively a description of how to prove that a program is infringing, not a description of the know-how so that the knowledge of society is enhanced. Since that is actually the foundation of the social contract that justifies patents, it seems obvious to me that software patents should include a viable implementation with a free copyright license (BSD perhaps) so that after the expiration of the patent the know-how is readily available.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                I’m not a lawyer so I don’t know how workable all these are, but it’s clear Something Must Be Done. So, what would <em>you</em> do?
                            </p><br>
