                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                The controversy set off by the theft of e-mails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit resulted in at least four independent inquiries. One took place at Penn State, home institution of Michael Mann, whose e-mails were among those released; Mann was <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/02/no-formal-charges-from-first-climate-e-mail-investigations.ars">largely cleared</a>, although a more detailed examination of some issues is ongoing. A second was performed by the UK Parliament's Science and Technology Committee. This inquiry concluded that, although there was a "problematic" lack of transparency at the CRU, the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/03/uk-parliament-clears-climatologists-calls-for-more-openness.ars">e-mails did not reveal anything untoward</a>. Now, the UEA's own inquiry into the matter has been completed, and it has reached similar conclusions: nobody at the CRU appears to have engaged in scientific malfeasance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The panel set up by the UEA was comprised of an international group of researchers from institutions like MIT and Cambridge, and its charge was to examine the research performed by the CRU. "The essence of the criticism that the Panel was asked to address was that climatic data had been dishonestly selected, manipulated and/or presented to arrive at pre-determined conclusions that were not compatible with a fair interpretation of the original data," as the report puts it. After it examined a number of publications and conducted interviews with CRU staff members, the panel concluded that the criticisms didn't hold water.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In focusing on the CRU's work in climate proxy reconstructions and production of a global instrument record, the panel concluded that there often aren't "right" answers on which data to include and how to process it, and results continue to be refined as more data comes in—that's one reason why there are so many different proxy studies. Nevertheless, the panel concluded that there were scientific bases for the judgement calls made by the members of the CRU, and no evidence of "deliberate scientific malpractice."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Panel did conclude that the work could have been strengthened by a greater collaboration with professional statisticians; the methods chosen by the CRU researchers were reasonable, but they weren't necessarily the best or most appropriate. As with the Parliamentary inquiry, the panel also suggests that a greater emphasis should be placed on the disclosure of data and methods, calling the CRU staff "dedicated if slightly disorganised researchers who were ill-prepared for being the focus of public attention."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This leaves us with one formal inquiry still in progress, along with a follow-up on one aspect of Michael Mann's behavior. Unless either of these reaches conclusions that are radically different from the ones that preceded them, the matter will be considered settled, at least from the perspective of the governments involved and the academic community. Based on the responses to the earlier reports, however, there is substantial online community that will consider anything short of a complete repudiation of proxy and instrument records to be insufficient—there's little reason to expect that this new report will change their minds.
