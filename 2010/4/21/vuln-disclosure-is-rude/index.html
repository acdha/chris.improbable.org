                        <blockquote>
                            It's amazing that after all this time, our community has not come to grips with "vulnerability disclosure". Last weekend, a lot of people tweeted the following scenario from this <a href="http://attrition.org/security/rants/disclosure01.html">Attrition blog</a> post on the difficulties of vuln disclosure:<br>
                            <blockquote>
                                ME: "Hi, you left your headlights on."<br>
                                NEIGHBOR: "WHO SENT YOU? DID MY EX-WIFE SEND YOU? ARE YOU SLEEPING WITH HER?"
                            </blockquote>The intent of this is to show how badly people react to "friendly" disclosure of vulns. <b>However, vuln disclosure isn't friendly.</b> It is an inherently rude act. It's more like writing "WASH ME" in the dirt covering a person's car. Your standard of cleanliness may differ than your neighbor's. Pointing this out will always get a hostile reaction.<br>
                            <br>
                            What vuln researchers expect is something like the following scenario:<br>
                            <blockquote>
                                ME: "Your hairstyle is ugly."<br>
                                NEIGHBOR: "Thank you for telling me. I'll go to the hairdresser and fix it immediately."
                            </blockquote>That's not going to happen. I mean, try it with your neighbor. I'd bet that you'll get a hostile reaction rather than the desired one above.<br>
                            <br>
                            The reason vuln disclosure is rude is because most people don't care about fixing security problems. This includes not only the vendor, but also the customer. Sure, the customers care when vulns cause a problem, but frankly, most vulns don't cause problems. For the average small software vendor, no hacker will ever exploit even obvious vulns in their products. I know this because people hire us all the time to find vulns. We find the most shockingly obvious things that have been in their products for years, yet going back through log we fail to find any evidence that malicious hackers have found and exploited those problems.<br>
                            <br>
                            Security is a tradeoff. When a small company fixes a vuln, it comes at a huge cost. It means fixing something that their customers largely do not care about (and would not pay for) at the expense of adding new features that customers would want (and pay for). When a researcher publishes a vuln in a product, it a previously harmless vuln becomes harmful, forcing a tradeoff to be made that neither the vendor nor the customer wanted.<br>
                            <br>
                            It's hard for vuln research to grasp the enormity of the tradeoff. For us, security is easy. We can pentest a product and come up with an obvious vuln within seconds. Here's a real scenario: we were asked to look at a product, so we put a packet-sniffer on the wire and within seconds found a secret password being sent in the clear that would allow us to own all their customers. Yet, for the small software vendor, this black magic. Nobody in the company knows how to use a packet-sniffer, nor is there any budget to hire somebody who can. Nobody understands really how to fix the problem that isn't equally insecure. Their development process is so crappy that they can't track this bug and make sure it's fixed.<br>
                            <br>
                            Vuln disclosers believe that such problems wouldn't exist "if only people took security seriously". That's not the issue. I could hold a gun to your head and tell you to solve a third order differential equation. No matter how seriously you took my threat, you still would not have the ability to solve it. Sure it'd be straightforward for a mathematician to solve, but essentially impossible for everyone else. Vulns are straightforward for us, but still impossibly difficult for most vendors.<br>
                            <br>
                            The Attrition blogpost linked above focused on the idea of "responsible disclosure". Vuln researchers can be extremely rude while cloaking themselves in "responsibility". For example, you often see vuln reports where the researcher claimed that the vendor ignored their vuln. That's not precisely true. What really happens is that researchers often act in passive-aggressive ways to make sure that the disclosure process goes awry. Sure, the immediate response of any vendor is to deny a problem (especially small vendors that have never dealt with a vuln before). Polite researchers try to overcome this hurdle in a positive fashion, passive-aggressive researchers exploit this to show why the vendor is evil or stupid. The Attrition article is a good example of the passive-aggressive attitude: it always goes awry, but somehow it's always the vendor's fault and not theirs.<br>
                            <br>
                            There is really no such thing as "irresponsible disclosure". It's like how there is no such thing as "irresponsible free speech", even speech that is extremely rude. Some countries have laws against "insulting" the leader of government. These laws are invariable used to suppress legitimate dissent and criticism of the government.<br>
                            <br>
                            In much the same way, while individual vuln disclosures might suck for the vendor (and its customers), the value of full disclosure has yielded enormous benefits. Software is developed now in a fundamentally more secure fashion. Disclosed vulns led to worms 10 years ago, but now network worms are rare. We've learned to ship product and configure networks so that they are less susceptible to worms.<br>
                            <br>
                            Therefore, we should not delude ourselves that we are helping the vendor (or their customers) with a disclosed vuln: we usually aren't. We should understand the inherent rudeness of our actions and behave in a humble manner. Yet, while the vendor will hate us, we should still disclose such vulns, because unfettered security research serves the greater good.<br>
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-weight:bold">UPDATE by David Maynor (5:08pm EST):</span> The more people involved, the more likely it'll go awry. Vulnerability Disclosure is like sex: it should be between 2 people, 3 max. Any more participants will result in a big mess of hurt feelings, bruised egos, NDAs and a weird feeling in the pit of your stomach anytime it is mentioned.
