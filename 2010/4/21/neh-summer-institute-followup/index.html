                            <p>
                                The other week I <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2010/04/10/what-do-you-mean-your-wife-wont-take-care-of-them/">wrote about</a> a <a href="http://feministphilosophers.wordpress.com/2010/04/10/ways-women-are-excluded/">report</a> that a philosopher accepted to an <span>NEH</span> Summer Institute overseas “been given 12 hours to ‘demonstrate’ that she has full-time childcare arrangements for her son for the month of July that ‘are to the [completely unspecified] satisfaction’ of the Institute directors; if she fails to meet this requirement, she has been told her accceptance in the program will be withdrawn.” At the time, it seemed clear that there was no way an <span>NEH</span>-funded operation should be doing this and that, while there was some slim possibility of an explanation that made the whole episode seem reasonable, the Institute director or directors were very much more likely to be completely out of line in making such a demand. Well, <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/04/21/qt#225584">guess what</a>?
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                The National Endowment for the Humanities has apologized to a grant recipient who was told by the director of an <span>NEH</span>-financed seminar in Europe that she had 12 hours to demonstrate that she had adequate child care arrangements in place for her son or she would lose her spot. … An <span>NEH</span> spokeswoman, via e-mail, said Tuesday that the investigation by the endowment determined that the report “was, unfortunately, true. <span>NEH</span> has accepted full responsibility and apologized to the professor involved. We believe we are in the process of resolving the issue to her satisfaction. We have assured her that she is welcome to attend the institute to which she applied and, at her request, we have also extended the deadline to make it possible for her to apply for another seminar if she so chooses.” The spokeswoman added: “Asking an applicant to provide information regarding child care was inappropriate and should have had no bearing on the selection process. Qualified applicants who tell the <span>NEH</span> that they will participate full time in our programs should be taken at their word. We erred and are determined that it will not happen again.”
