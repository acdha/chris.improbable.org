                        <blockquote>
                            As a faculty member in the University of Texas system, there are two major ways my salary increases.<br>
                            <br>
                            First, I can get promoted to a new rank. And, well, that typically only happens twice in an academic career: once when you’re promoted from assistant to associate professor, and once when you’re promoted from associate to full professor. Obviously, those raises are few and far between.<br>
                            <br>
                            Second, I can earn merit raises. This is an annual evaluation of my achievements in teaching, research, and service. There’s a complex formula to determine this, but not surprisingly, more published science gets you more points, and potentially a bigger raise.<span style="font-size:xx-small"><sup>*</sup></span><br>
                            <br>
                            Why does this system potentially stifle scientific progress?<br>
                            <br>
                            This year could be the most productive year of my career to date. I’ve got two peer-reviewed papers so far (one <a href="http://inverts.info/content/establishment-and-care-laboratory-colony-parthenogenetic-marbled-crayfish-marmorkrebs">out</a>, one in press), a <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.327.5965.523-a">letter</a> in <i>Science</i>, a <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/the-open-laboratory-2009/6402822">contribution</a> to the <i>Open Laboratory 2009</i> anthology, and I’ve got several other projects that could get published this year.<br>
                            <br>
                            But.<br>
                            <br>
                            <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/S7ZkVeL-L9I/AAAAAAAAC9E/lIJIs65x72U/s1600/moneymind2.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em"><img border="0" height="144" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_TZ60-72xZZk/S7ZkVeL-L9I/AAAAAAAAC9E/lIJIs65x72U/s200/moneymind2.jpg" width="200"></a>From a purely rational economic point of view, it would be blindingly <b>stupid</b> of me to be publish anything this year.<br>
                            <br>
                            Nobody is expecting to get <b>any</b> merit increase this year. Our university has been asked to make a budget cut of several percentage points due to the recession (as many institutions are). Travel budgets are among the first to go, but merit often also goes.<br>
                            <br>
                            If I were smart, I should hold off on publishing my research during this academic year. I should submit things so that they’ll be published in the next academic year, when there’s at least a <b>possibility</b> that there might be merit money in it for me.<br>
                            <br>
                            So I’ve just been given a financial incentive <b>not</b> to publish research as soon as I can. But it’s bloody <i>hard</i> for me to take the strictly rational route that economists tell me I should take in maximizing my own utility! As a scientist, I want my work out there as soon as possible. I want to be moving on to new projects, not sitting on completed manuscripts, waiting for the financial fortunes of the state to improve.<br>
                            <br>
                            Has anyone else pointed this out to politicians and administrators and those who talk about scientific competitiveness, innovations that lead to economic recovery, and so on?<br>
                            <br>
                            <span style="font-size:xx-small"><sup>*</sup></span> <span style="font-size:xx-small">Those of you playing along at home will notice that there is no cost of living increase.</span><br>
