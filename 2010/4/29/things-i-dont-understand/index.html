                                    I don't have much to say on this.  I'm mostly just drawing attention to something that I had assumed had stopped under the Obama administration, but apparently hasn't.
                                </p>

                                    They are still using sensory deprivation during transport of the Gitmo prisoners:  <a href="http://washingtonindependent.com/83509/confusion-reigns-at-gitmo-after-khadr-is-a-courtroom-no-show">cite</a>

                                    <br>
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>

                                        Omar Khadr’s pre-trial hearing this morning experienced an unexplained hour-long delay. Court officers filtered in at 10 a.m., without a certain important individual: Omar Khadr.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Prosecution promptly called a Marine Corps captain, Laura Bruzzese, to testify that she informed Khadr at 5:15 a.m. that there was a hearing scheduled for this morning. Khadr had a blanket over his head and complained of pain in his left eye, which has been sightless after an injury sustained during his 2002 capture in Afghanistan. She had him escorted to the infirmary, where he received an eyedrop for the pain, and in Camp Delta security officers attempted to load Khadr into a van to transport him to court. Part of that transfer involved putting what Bruzzese called “Eyes and Ears” on Khadr: blackout ski goggles and earmuffs to block out his senses while in transit.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Only Khadr refused. When Bruzzese asked him why he wouldn’t wear the Eyes and Ears — standard operating procedure for transiting a detainee, she testified — Khadr responded, “The only purpose is to humiliate me.” Under cross-examination, she testified that the van used for transport has no windows. Khadr wouldn’t, in other words, be able to understand where he was going even without the Eyes and Ears.

                                    So ummm, what the heck?  Why are we still doing that?  Are we afraid that the prisoners will be able to tell their defense attorney about the inside of the van?  About the secret route into the courthouse?  What is going on?
