                                    -<em>by Sebastian H</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Part II.  <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2010/04/taxes.html">Part I Can Be Found Here</a>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One of the main reasons why the US tax code is so complicated is that it has tens of thousands of policy choices as tax deductions, tax credits, and other forms of tax breaks.  I obviously can't comment on all of them individually (though I will comment on the top 5) but I can comment on them as a whole.  For the most part, putting policy decisions in the tax code is a bad idea.  It does a number of things that are not conducive to good government.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    1) It hides subsidies.  Things can get tucked away in the tax code which probably wouldn't survive as open subsidies--especially because it isn't always as obvious how much money is in the subsidy unlike budget items for direct subsidies.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    2) It allows recipients of the subsidies to feel like they aren't getting anything special from the government.  This particular problem tends to exhibit itself in the idea that many of the rich are paying without getting much in return..  As we will see, many of the largest tax-oriented subsidies end up being directed to the rich and very rich, who don't see them as subsidies.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    3) It makes taxation more complicated and distorts people's decisions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My proposal is simple.  We don't make subsidies through the tax code.  If something is important to subsidize, do so directly.  Otherwise don't.  Now admittedly this is a long term goal.  It isn't fair to cut tax subsidies that people have been relying on immediately, but we certainly could phase them out.  
                                </p>

                                    So here are the top 5 tax breaks according to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation: (hat tip <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/real-estate/article/109334/mortgage-deduction-americas-costliest-tax-break?">Jeanne Sahadi</a>).

                                     The Mortgage Interest Deduction is a clear subsidy.  It is worth about $573 billion.  It was part of the strong government effort to get more people to own their residences.   It has also turned into a pretty clear subsidy for the rich:
                                </p>

                                        Of those who had mortgages in 2008, roughly 72% claimed the mortgage deduction. But those who benefited most were higher-income households, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Almost half of the returns claiming the deduction were from filers with incomes over $100,000, and roughly 75% in foregone revenue that year went to them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Meanwhile, 32% of the money went to households with incomes over $200,000, even though they accounted for only 11% of the returns claiming the deduction.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Moreover, since housing is treated more favorably tax-wise than other investments such as stocks, some economists believe the home tax breaks distort people's investment decisions. By making the mortgage deduction less valuable, they argue, that could make the economy more efficient overall.<br>

                                    Now I can't prove that a mortgage interest subsidy which was sold as going 75% to people with incomes over $100,000 would not pass in Congress.  But I strongly suspect it wouldn't.  It is effectively a $430 billion subsidy to people with large mortgages and incomes over $100,000.  It probably isn't a good idea in general, and certainly not scaling all the way up to one million dollar mortgages.  I would propose that the mortgage interest deduction be removed and replaced with a similar (but to be phased out) subsidy.  And the only reason I would do that is because it wouldn't be fair to those who relied on the deduction when making purchasing decisions.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The next large subsidy is the health care subsidy for work based plans.  It is also enormous (though if I understood the health care debate properly it is at least partially on the way out).  It strikes me as much more defensible policy than the mortgage deduction, but it makes much more sense as a direct subsidy rather than a tax treatment.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The exclusion of retirement plan contributions doesn't strike me so much as a subsidy, as a choice about when to tax the money.  I'm open to either treatment really.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The lower tax rate on dividends/cap gains is definitely a subsidy but would be better dealt with under my forthcoming "What is Income" post, so I'll defer discussion of that item.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The EITC is a subsidy, but it is one of the few that actually works more efficiently through the tax system than outside of it.  It operates on a sliding scale based on income, and is designed to automatically reduce the subsidy as your income goes up--a method which lends itself well to being integrated directly into the tax structure.  Since federal taxation is on income, and the subsidy is directly connected to income, it isn't any more distorting to put it directly in the tax code.  My earlier proposal (linked above) has EITC properties in the ramp up to the basic tax rate.
