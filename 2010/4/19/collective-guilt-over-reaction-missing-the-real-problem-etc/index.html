                            <p>
                                <strong>By Thoreau</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For obvious reasons, Muslim groups in the US feel a very urgent need to do what they can to prevent troubled youths from joining terrorist groups.  There’s the obvious humanitarian desire to prevent terrorism, and the self-interested (and understandable!) desire to be seen as part of the solution rather than part of the problem the next time something bad happens and people start looking for scapegoats.  However, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-radical19-2010apr19,0,1895886.story">an interesting article in this morning’s LA Times</a> points out that some Muslim communities are getting a bit tired of Yet Another Workshop On Preventing Extremism.  At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of American Muslims aren’t terrorists, don’t know any terrorists, and will never enc0unter anybody even connected to terrorists.  It must be pretty galling to constantly sit through lectures on how the threat of extremism is everywhere in your community and you must be vigilant.  I’m sure that just about every Muslim out there supports the goal of helping troubled youth and preventing tragedies, but how many times should a decent, hard-working person have to sit through a seminar implying some special responsibility for terrorism?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Also, there’s  a point that isn’t touched on in the article, probably because the Muslims interviewed are trying to give an upbeat picture of their community:  In addition to being downright galling, I suspect that at some point these efforts get in the way of solving real problems.  While Muslim-Americans are not, overall, any more troubled than any other group in America, I’m sure that they do have their share of troubled youths, and for most of those troubled youths terrorism is probably not the main problem they face.  I’ll bet that your average Imam counseling at-risk teens and young adults sees pretty much the same stuff as any other clergyman, social worker, counselor, etc.:  Drugs, alcohol, crime, broken homes, poverty, teen pregnancy, mental illness, inter-generational conflicts, etc.  Muslim-Americans may not face these problems in any greater proportion than anyone else, but I’m sure they face them nonetheless.  If you’re an Imam, and your days are spent counseling drug addicts and suicidal teens and dropouts, you could probably derive more benefit from an hour of comparing notes with a Priest or Minister or Rabbi counseling youths in similar situations than from Yet Another Terrorism Prevention Workshop Sponsored By CAIR.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The problem, of course, is that if at any point just one of the millions of Muslims in America does something horrible and tragic, all too many people (some of them with badges) won’ t focus on the “one in tens of millions” aspect of the situation.  They’ll start harassing people in mosques.  The risks facing the Muslim community in terms of backlash are grossly disproportionate to the actual likelihood (or probable scale) of a terrorist attack, let alone the likelihood that a terrorist will come from any particular community.  So an exceedingly small risk commands disproportionate attention.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In a way, this reminds me of the risk of school shootings in higher education:  There are thousands of colleges and universities in the US, and millions of college students.  If every few years one of them does something horrible and tragic, that is of course awful for the people affected.  If you happen to come across a situation posing a real risk of tragedy of course you should try to prevent it.  But the reality is that school shootings are the wrong lens through which to view most troubled college students, just as terrorism is the wrong lens through which to view most troubled Muslim youth.  To their credit, my school recognized this, and when I went to New Faculty Orientation in the fall after the VA Tech shooting, the “What to do about troubled students?” session focused very little on shootings, and mostly on the actual problems caused by the vast majority of actual students that we will actually deal with.
