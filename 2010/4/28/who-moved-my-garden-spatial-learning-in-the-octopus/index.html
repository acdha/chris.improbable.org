                            <p>
                                <span style="float:left;padding:5px"><a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"><img alt="ResearchBlogging.org" src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"></a></span>Say you're visiting Los Angeles and you have a sudden craving for Chinese food. Since you are only visiting, you might not be aware that nothing is open past, like, 10pm (<a href="http://laist.com/2010/04/09/las_broken_all-night_coffee_shop_sc.php">not even coffee houses</a>), but you get in your rental car and go driving around in search of your Chinese feast anyway. You try hitting up Panda Express, but no such luck. Of course they're closed. You try the neighborhood Chinese restaurant: closed as well. You get back in the car, and think to yourself "maybe the OTHER Panda Express will be open", but alas, it is not. You are ready to return to the hotel and just go to sleep when you think to yourself, "the MARKET is still open." And since you are a culinary genius, you know how to make a homemade version of <a href="http://www.pandaexpress.com/menu/ofc.aspx">Panda's orange chicken</a> (I bet you want that recipe, don't you? Don't try looking it up online; you'll find some weak imitations, and I have tried them all). So you head to the market, collect your ingredients, and head back. It's late, but you're motivated enough to cook. Lucky for you, your hotel room has a kitchenette.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now you're faced with a problem. When you set out on your orange chicken quest, you did not know where you would find those glazed pieces of chickeny goodness. You just drove around. Now you have to find your way back to the hotel, and without relying on GPS or Google Maps, or whatever. Since you're visiting, you don't know the streets at all. You do remember though that your hotel was near a really tall office building. Maybe you could try to find that building.
                            </p>

                                This is the problem facing many animals, every day. Today, we shall concern ourselves with the octopus.
