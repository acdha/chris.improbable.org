                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Brokerage firm DA Davidson has agreed to pay a fine of $375,000 for failing to protect confidential client data from Latvian hackers who breached the company in 2007 in an online extortion scheme.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The hackers used a SQL injection attack to obtain access to the company’s database on Dec. 25 and 26, 2007.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which announced the fine agreement on Monday, said although the attack activity was reflected in the brokerage’s server logs, administrators failed to examine those logs. The intruders obtained data on about 192,000 customers, according to the press release announcing the fine. (Previous reports indicated that more than 300,000 customer files were stolen). The data included customer account numbers, Social Security numbers, names, addresses, dates of birth and other private information.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The company discovered the breach only after receiving an extortion e-mail from one of the hackers on Jan. 16, 2008, which contained an attachment with the records of 20,000 customers as proof of the intrusion. DA Davidson contacted the Secret Service, and the subsequent investigation led to four suspects, three of whom are Latvian nationals, who were extradited from the Netherlands to face charges in Montana.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Aleksandrs Hoholko, 30, Jevgenijs Kuzmenko, 26, and Vitalijs Drozdovs, 33, pleaded guilty last month in Montana to making threatening communications and receiving extortion proceeds. They are scheduled to be sentenced in June. The fourth suspect, <a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2010/04/indictment_hoholko.pdf">who called himself Robert Borko</a> (.pdf) in correspondence with the brokerage firm, has not yet appeared in court.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to the indictment, Borko was responsible for conducting the breach, then used the Latvians as couriers to receive the extortion payments. He identified himself as an “independent IT security consultant” in an e-mail to the brokerage firm and said he would delete the stolen information and identify IT security weaknesses to the company as part of his extortion agreement. According to court documents, he attempted to extort $80,000 from the brokerage firm.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The scheme follows a pattern of extortion plots that have hit other companies over the years, whereby criminal hackers, and unscrupulous security professionals, have attempted to sell their “security consulting” services to firms after breaching their networks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although DA Davidson had obtained a security audit two months before the breach, FINRA found that the company had failed to employ adequate security safeguards by not encrypting its customer database and using a default blank password to control access. The company also failed to install an intrusion-detection system, which had been recommended by auditors in a prior 2006 inspection.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Last year, Davidson settled a class-action lawsuit that included $1 million set aside as reimbursement for customers who may suffer losses due to the breach. To date, no DA Davidson customers are known to have been the victims of fraud as a result of the intrusion.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is a private corporation funded by the financial industry as an independent regulator
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The FINRA fine against Davidson is relatively small compared to fines that have been levied against other companies for data breaches. Earlier this year, Heartland Payment Systems, a New Jersey card processing company, agreed to pay $60 million to Visa to <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Security/Heartland-Agrees-to-60M-Settlement-With-Visa-Over-Breach-597954/">settle losses related to a data breach</a> the company experienced in 2008 when <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/08/tjx-hacker-charged-with-heartland/">hackers based in Eastern Europe accessed card data</a> for more than 100 million card accounts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Visa is part of the Card Payment Industry alliance, which requires companies that process bank card transactions to meet a set of security standards that includes encrypting card data, installing firewalls and anti-virus programs and maintaining robust password-security protocols.
