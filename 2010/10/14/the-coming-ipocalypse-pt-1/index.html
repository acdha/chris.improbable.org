                            <p>
                                Nearly 15 years ago, the IETF gave final approval to <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1883.txt">the next version of <acronym title="Internet Protocol">IP</acronym></a>: IPv6. This came after several years of extensive research, prototyping and work by a lot of very smart people attempting to solve the problems facing the then-current version, IPv4. The problem is, in the intervening years, IPv6 has not been rolled out into production on any substantive basis. While <a href="http://ipv6.internet2.edu/">Internet2</a> has made some effort at rolling it out, the penetration is still not full, and IPv4 continues to run in parallel.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So what does all this mean? Well, a few weeks ago, <acronym title="Office of Management and Budget">OMB</acronym> released <a href="http://www.cio.gov/Documents/IPv6MemoFINAL.pdf">a memo</a> (PDF) instructing federal agencies to begin migration now. The problem? Well, who remembers <acronym title="Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile">GOSIP</acronym>, a US government mandate that all agencies use <acronym title="Open Systems Interconnect">OSI</acronym> protocols for their networks. This was issued in 1990, and by 1995 it had been watered down to effectively say “well, use something”. <acronym title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</acronym>–based solutions like IP were the dominant solutions at that point. This is to say that — as interesting as an OMB mandate might appear to be — it’s effectively a toothless piece of paper that has zero impact.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So where does that leave us?
                            </p>
                            <div style="float:right"></div>
                            <p>
                                Now, it’s important to understand that in my opinion, IPv6 is inevitable. It isn’t a question of if, but when, and that when is quickly approaching. You can see by the gadget to the right that address space is quickly disappearing. Now, some extensions can be managed by recovering some sparsely utilized space, but that’s just more duct-tape on the situation. The reality is that with the massive expansion of networked devices, the need for a larger address space is inevitable. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation"><acronym title="Network Address Translation">NAT</acronym></a> has helped delay the inevitable, but it’s coming. <acronym title="American Registry for Internet Numbers">ARIN</acronym> has a <a href="https://www.arin.net/knowledge/v4-v6.html">has a great explanation of the issues</a>. There’s more than just address exhaustion driving it, but that’s certainly the most visible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With all that scary foreboding, what’s the blog post about? Well, it was inspired by a project I’m working on that involves dealing with a large number of IP addresses, which today are your garden-variety 32-bit IPv4 addresses, but given the lifetime of the project, I have to assume that 128-bit IPv6 addresses will become relevant. That means I’ve got to solve a couple of issues:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>How do you represent the addresses in transit, storage?
                                </li>
                                <li>How do you cope with hosts that have a <em>minimum</em> of 2 addresses?
                                </li>
                                <li>How do you process addresses?
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                For the first problem, I can either store a “flag” and then either the 32 or 128-bit address, or I can map IPv4 addresses into the IPv6 address space. This later option seems a much more elegant solution, as it keeps one address space for everything and allows for fewer code paths. There are, on-the-surface, two ways to accomplish this mapping, covered in <acronym title="Request for Comment">RFC</acronym>s <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2373.txt">2373</a>, <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2765.txt">2765</a>, <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3493.txt">3493</a> and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4942.txt">4942</a>:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>IPv4-compatible
                                </li>
                                <li>IPv4-mapped
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                An IPv4-compatible notation holds an embedded global IPv4 address. They are used to tunnel IPv6 packets over IPv4 networks. IPv6 nodes that use this technique are assigned special IPv6 unicast addresses which hold an IPv4 address in the low-order 32-bits, where the upper 96-bits are all set to zero. IPv4-mapped notation also holds an embedded global IPv4 address, however it is used to represent the addresses of IPv4 nodes as IPv6 addresses to applications that are enabled for IPv6 and are using AF_INET6 sockets. This allows IPv6 enabled applications always to deal with IP addresses in IPv6 format regardless of whether the TCP/IP communications are occurring over IPv4 or IPv6 networks. In this situation, the IPv4 address is again mapped to the low-order 32-bits, but the upper 96-bits are set to <code>0:0:0:0:0:FFFF</code>, or 80 zero bits followed by 16 ones.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The difference between these two kinds of addresses is important, but subtle. Since the first 80 bits are always zero, we know it is an embedded IPv4 address. IPv4-compatible IPv6 addresses are <em>only</em> used for devices that are actually IPv6-aware, and where the IPv4-compatible address is in addition to its conventional IPv6 address. Conversely, if <code>FFFF</code> is seen for the 16 bits after the first 80, this means a conventional IPv4 devices whose IPv4 address has been mapped into the IPv6 format, and it is <em>not</em> an IPv6-capable device. For me, this makes it clear. I want to use the IPv4-mapped address format, as shown here:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <img src="http://assets.amber.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/ipv4v6.png" alt="Bitmap of how IPv4 is mapped into IPv6" title="IPv4-mapped" width="377" height="46">
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Having decided to represent IPv4 addresses within the IPv6 address space using the IPv4-mapping notation, the question becomes how do we store these addresses? The main concern people may have is that an IPv6 address is four times the size of an IPv4 address, but I think the reality is that this is really much less of an issue in this day-and-age than it was just a few years ago. Even storing a 100M pair of addresses, say for an IDS, the difference is only gigabyte or two. If you’re using <a href="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>, then the storing of these addresses is already figured out for you: just use the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/datatype-net-types.html#DATATYPE-INET"><code>inet</code></a> column type. If you’re using MySQL, or most other database systems, then my recommendation is to store it as a pair of 64-bit integers, in the form of <code>UNSIGNED BIGINT</code> columns, perhaps named <code>ipaddr_hi</code> and <code>ipaddr_lo</code>. This is sub-optimal, but from what I understand from more knowledgable people than I, there are representational issues getting things in and out of a <code>BIT</code> field. For situations where you’re storing it in other things, similar strategies can be taken. If you’re simply talking about textual representation, then following RFC 2373 is the best strategy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And that’s it for this post. I’ll deal with the two big remaining issues: how to process addresses intelligently, and how to deal with the fact that a machines does not equal an address. It never has, but that situation is becoming even more absurd as time wears on.
                            </p>
