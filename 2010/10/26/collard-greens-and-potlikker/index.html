                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Traditionally, collard greens require two things the modern home cook seems to find in short supply: time and a ham hock. This is unfortunate for a number of reasons, chief among them being that collard greens are awesome and should be enjoyed regularly, even by those of us short on time and pork shank.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here you may be tempted to ask what a collard green is, anyway. In the States, we associate them with southern cooking and southern chefs take no small amount of pride in their greens. Truth is, collards, a kind of cabbage, have been around since ancient times, first cultivated along the Mediterranean. The hearty stalks were easily transplanted all across Europe and beyond. The traditional southern preparation, slow cooked with bits of pork, traces back to African slaves, who were often made to do with leftovers of the tough greens and unused pig parts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’ve seen recipes that call for cooking collards for up to three hours, which strikes me as out of reach for all but the most dedicated cook. Fortunately, it’s easy to cut this long cook time by stripping out the tough center stalk. As for the ham hock, I suppose we’ll have to make do with bacon. For four servings, you’ll want about half a pound of very thick cut bacon<sup><a href="http://saltandfat.com/#fn:p1407954760-bacon" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, a large bunch of greens (two pounds or so), two tablespoons of kosher salt, a tablespoon of red pepper flakes and a clove of garlic (or two!) peeled and smashed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lavxn8o7yo1qz4s19.jpg" alt="">
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Set a large pot or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ASAFIC?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jimray-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002ASAFIC">enamel dutch oven</a><sup><a href="http://saltandfat.com/#fn:p1407954760-dutch%20oven" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> over medium low heat. Cut the bacon crosswise so that they’re roughly the same width as they are thick (the French call these <em>lardon</em>) and add them to pot. Let them cook slowly for about 10 minutes to render the fat but keep watch so they don’t burn. If you’re a vegetarian or vegan, feel free to sub in a few tablespoons of butter or vegetable oil, which obviously won’t require the time to render, just heat up.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lavxnv5Cec1qz4s19.jpg" alt="">
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While the bacon is rendering its fat, prep the leathery collard leaves. Rinse them well to get rid of any lingering soil. Stack two or three on top of each other, point the back end towards the top of your cutting board and slice the leaves on either side of the stalk. Then, stack the two sets of leaves on top of one another, roll them up and slice them about an inch or two thick. This will give them enough substance to keep together but still be manageable when served.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lavxocbzAO1qz4s19.jpg" alt="">
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With the fat rendered, add the greens to the pot and stir them around to coat in as much bacon fat as possible; be careful here, any water on the greens will spatter in the bacon fat. Let the greens cook dry for thirty seconds or so, until the leaves are bright green, then add enough cold water to just cover the greens. Set the heat to about medium, and loosely cover until it starts to simmer. Add the salt, red pepper and garlic, stir, and let simmer for half an hour, up to an hour, depending on the consistency you want. I prefer my greens well cooked but not falling apart. This is an excellent accompaniment to roast chicken and goes great right on top of a heap of rice, which soaks up some of that delicious liquid.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And what of that liquid gold! Don’t you dare throw it out when it comes time to clean the kitchen, it’s amazing stuff. Down south, we call it potlikker<sup><a href="http://saltandfat.com/#fn:p1407954760-potlikker" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and it makes an excellent base for stews and soups, poured right over rice or grits or sopped up directly with corn bread. Any of the nutrients released by the vitamin-rich collards are still in the stock, not to mention the smokey goodness of the bacon. Strain it through a sieve or colander, toss the boiled bacon and spices, store it in the fridge then skim off any fat that congeals once it cools. Potlikker, like all stocks, freezes remarkably well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’d say even on a busy night, you could <a href="http://saltandfat.com/post/424261076/roasting-a-chicken">roast a chicken</a> and prep some collards, neither of which require much real work, in just about an hour.

                                            A word about the bacon — you want it to be very smokey and as thick as possible. The aim is to render as much fat as possible from the bacon to braise the greens and then to extract as much of the smokey flavor as you can while everything simmers. When I smoke my own bacon, I save the ends that I can’t slice, freeze them and pull them out, sliced about half an inch thick, for collards. You might find a butcher who’ll do the same for you.&nbsp;<a href="http://saltandfat.com/#fnref:p1407954760-bacon">↩</a>

                                            I love enamel dutch ovens, despite their absurd price. Le Creuset and Staub are two well known French brands, I own and use both, though I prefer Staub, personally. Lodge, the American iron mongers, started making their own <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CMLU26?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jimray-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002CMLU26">enamel dutch ovens</a> a few years ago that are considerably cheaper and highly rated on Amazon.&nbsp;<a href="http://saltandfat.com/#fnref:p1407954760-dutch%20oven">↩</a>
