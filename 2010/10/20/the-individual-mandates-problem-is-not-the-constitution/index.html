                            <p>
                                Here are some of the Republican senators who <a href="http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2010/February/23/GOP-1993-health-reform-bill.aspx">co-sponsored</a> an individual mandate for health care when it was included in John Chafee's 1993 bill and are still serving in the upper chamber: Bob Bennett, Kit Bond, Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch and Richard Lugar.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here are some of the Republican senators who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_Americans_Act#Sponsors_and_co-sponsors">co-sponsored</a> an individual mandate in the Wyden-Bennett bill, and are still serving in the upper chamber: Bob Bennett, Lamar Alexander, Bob Corker, Mike Crapo, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Grassley and Judd Gregg.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You'll notice some overlap between the two bills. Bennett was on both, and so was Grassley. For a long time, the individual mandate was perfectly acceptable among conservatives. It was their idea, in fact. When Democrats adopted it as a way to craft a health-care bill that Republicans might accept, it became instantly noxious. Today, the conservative position on the individual mandate is that it's unconstitutional.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So you can understand my reluctance to give the argument much credit. I'm not saying it's cynical: I believe that partisans convince themselves of whatever it is they need to believe, and that those self-deceptions are sincerely held. But it's not the actual argument. The actual argument is that the individual mandate was passed by President Obama and the Democrats. If it had been passed by President Mitt Romney and the Republicans, its constitutionality would not be in doubt. Democrats would be unlikely to challenge it (it isn't in their interest to narrow the Supreme Court's reading of the Commerce Clause), and if they did, the conservative Supreme Court would be unlikely to consider their challenge. Conversely, I don't know anyone who doubts that if one of the Republican-appointed justices had to resign and Obama had the opportunity to name his replacement, the individual mandate would be safe.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now the individual mandate is traveling through the courts. A judge appointed by Bill Clinton has ruled it constitutional. A judge appointed by Ronald Reagan has signaled that he might do the opposite. Last week, Bill Dailey <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/10/the_constitutionality_of_the_i_1.html">asked</a> whether I truly believed the Supreme Court part of this cynical dance. And the answer is yes, I do.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That doesn't mean I think the Supreme Court will rule the mandate unconstitutional. Coming on the heels of Citizens United, that would spark a tremendous confrontation between the Democratic Party, the Democratic president, and the Supreme Court of the United States. There are good reasons for them to prefer avoiding that outcome. They may try to split the difference, offering a limited ruling requiring slight tweaks to the mandate.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Supreme-Court-Attitudinal-Model-Revisited/dp/0521789710">evidence</a> on past Supreme Court decisions, the heavily political process through which Supreme Court justices are now chosen, and our intuition -- the Supreme Court is full of human beings, and human beings have biases -- should make us very skeptical of claims that the Supreme Court is somehow removed from politics, or that the same partisan forces that turned the individual mandate from a conservative idea into a conservative <em>bete noire</em> are not behind the arguments now playing out in the courts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To put it slightly differently, I have no concerns about the abstract constitutionality of the individual mandate. Insofar as I have any concerns, they're about the partisan leanings of the Supreme Court's current occupants.
