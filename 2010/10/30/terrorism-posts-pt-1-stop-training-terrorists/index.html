                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <strong>By Thoreau</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, a few days ago the Ministry fur State Security told us that they had arrested a guy planning to blow up Metro stations.  Except, um, he was actually planning to go overseas and kill people, and <a href="http://highclearing.com/But%20Farooque%20Ahmed,%2034,%20of%20Loudoun%20County%20never%20suggested%20any%20attacks%20inside%20the%20United%20States,%20and%20the%20plot%20to%20attack%20Metro%20was%20hatched%20by%20government%20operatives%20posing%20as%20terrorists,%20according%20to%20court%20records%20unsealed%20Thursday.">the FBI had to prod him to decide to attack Metro stations instead</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If he really wanted to go to the other side of the globe and waste his life killing people, he could always just buy a plane ticket and do it.  (Or he could get a job with Blackwater.)  He  didn’t.  He talked to people.  He wanted people to encourage him to do it.  He wanted people to help train him support him.  He wasn’t finding that.  Until the FBI found him, and encouraged him to work at it, and eventually persuaded him to plan a domestic terrorist attack.  If this guy had been left alone, there’s an excellent chance that he would have done nothing at all.  He’d probably rant when he watches Al-Jazeera, maybe even cheers when he sees violence, but we have in this country lots of people who applaud when the government kills people overseas, so, yeah, pretty much like a Fox News viewer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We  keep seeing this pattern again and again:  The FBI finds some agitated, angry person who is talking about bad things but shows zero initiative.  They get him off the couch, encourage him, lean on him, and with much effort eventually get him to participate in a terrorist plot that the FBI helped hatch.  (I can’t recall the specific name, but I recently read of a case where the FBI even paid the guy to quit his job and devote his full-time activity to planning a terrorist attack.)  And then, after helping him assemble a fake bomb, they lock him up in a cage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When a guy like this shows up on the radar, instead of sending FBI agents to help train him in terrorism, why not just keep an eye on him from a distance?   I’m sure it’s not cheap, but then again when they’re sending agents to train him I assume that they still have him under surveillance between meetings with a recruiter.   So, either way he’ll be watched, but only one of these approaches involves active encouragement to engage in terrorism.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, I am very far from a Truther, but I wonder if some day the FBI will actually let a terrorist attack happen as part of a sting operation.  Jack Bauer once helped militiamen bomb a federal building to earn their trust and get info on a bigger plot.  The real world is very different from 24, of course, but we know that federal agents have turned a blind eye toward crimes committed by informants.  And it’s pretty clear that the FBI already has a screwed-up way of seeing things if they think that coaxing losers off of the couch and into bomb-making school is a good way to fight terrorism.  So, perhaps some day they’ll descend to the lowest depths of insanity and let a terrorist attack happen.
