                            <p>
                                <strong>By Thoreau</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, a few days ago the Ministry fur State Security told us that they had arrested a guy planning to blow up Metro stations.&nbsp; Except, um, he was actually planning to go overseas and kill people, and <a href="http://highclearing.com/But%20Farooque%20Ahmed,%2034,%20of%20Loudoun%20County%20never%20suggested%20any%20attacks%20inside%20the%20United%20States,%20and%20the%20plot%20to%20attack%20Metro%20was%20hatched%20by%20government%20operatives%20posing%20as%20terrorists,%20according%20to%20court%20records%20unsealed%20Thursday.">the FBI had to prod him to decide to attack Metro stations instead</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If he really wanted to go to the other side of the globe and waste his life killing people, he could always just buy a plane ticket and do it.&nbsp; (Or he could get a job with Blackwater.)&nbsp; He&nbsp; didn’t.&nbsp; He talked to people.&nbsp; He wanted people to encourage him to do it.&nbsp; He wanted people to help train him support him.&nbsp; He wasn’t finding that.&nbsp; Until the FBI found him, and encouraged him to work at it, and eventually persuaded him to plan a domestic terrorist attack.&nbsp; If this guy had been left alone, there’s an excellent chance that he would have done nothing at all.&nbsp; He’d probably rant when he watches Al-Jazeera, maybe even cheers when he sees violence, but we have in this country lots of people who applaud when the government kills people overseas, so, yeah, pretty much like a Fox News viewer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We&nbsp; keep seeing this pattern again and again:&nbsp; The FBI finds some agitated, angry person who is talking about bad things but shows zero initiative.&nbsp; They get him off the couch, encourage him, lean on him, and with much effort eventually get him to participate in a terrorist plot that the FBI helped hatch.&nbsp; (I can’t recall the specific name, but I recently read of a case where the FBI even paid the guy to quit his job and devote his full-time activity to planning a terrorist attack.)&nbsp; And then, after helping him assemble a fake bomb, they lock him up in a cage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When a guy like this shows up on the radar, instead of sending FBI agents to help train him in terrorism, why not just keep an eye on him from a distance?&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m sure it’s not cheap, but then again when they’re sending agents to train him I assume that they still have him under surveillance between meetings with a recruiter.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, either way he’ll be watched, but only one of these approaches involves active encouragement to engage in terrorism.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, I am very far from a Truther, but I wonder if some day the FBI will actually let a terrorist attack happen as part of a sting operation.&nbsp; Jack Bauer once helped militiamen bomb a federal building to earn their trust and get info on a bigger plot.&nbsp; The real world is very different from 24, of course, but we know that federal agents have turned a blind eye toward crimes committed by informants.&nbsp; And it’s pretty clear that the FBI already has a screwed-up way of seeing things if they think that coaxing losers off of the couch and into bomb-making school is a good way to fight terrorism.&nbsp; So, perhaps some day they’ll descend to the lowest depths of insanity and let a terrorist attack happen.
