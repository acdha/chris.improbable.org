                                <strong>By Thoreau</strong>

                                The TSA is rolling out those pornographic full-body scanners in more airports.&nbsp; If you don’t want your naked picture, or a naked picture of your teenage daughter, examined by a government employee and stored on a hard drive (that they only read for the articles), you can have a TSA pervert feel you up.&nbsp; In order to encourage&nbsp; more people to opt for the faster and less labor-intensive naked photo shoot, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/10/for-the-first-time-the-tsa-meets-resistance/65390/">the TSA is planning to make the heavy petting more intrusive</a>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>

                                    I asked him if he was looking forward to conducting the full-on pat-downs. “Nobody’s going to do it,” he said, “once they find out that we’re going to do.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In other words, people, when faced with a choice, will inevitably choose the Dick-Measuring Device over molestation? “That’s what we’re hoping for. We’re trying to get everyone into the machine.” He called over a colleague. “Tell him what you call the back-scatter,” he said. “The Dick-Measuring Device,” I said. “That’s the truth,” the other officer responded.

                                Actually, I echo <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1848928">Thomas Ptacek</a> (thanks to Eric the 0.5b for the link) and think that we should slow down the system by <em>insisting</em> on a pat-down.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>

                                    <span><span style="color:#000000">The pat-down is better than the machine. If my privacy is going to be invaded, I want to look the person doing it in the eyes. If I’m going to be embarassed, I want the agent embarassed too. The pat-downs are inconvenient. Systematized invasions of our most private things <em>should</em> be inconvenient. TSA agents are going to face a torrent of complaints alleging abuse, molestation, &amp;c. Good. The whole program is abusive.</span><span style="color:#000000">What scares me is the faceless machine nobody cares about silently collecting naked pictures of every citizen, managed by people nobody will ever see who can never be held accountable for <em>anything</em>. You can’t simply flip a switch and capture high fidelity copies of a pat-down search. You can with the machines.</span></span>

Their M.O. is that nobody takes the time to file those complaints. They’re counting on people not bothering with the pat-down because the machine seems more convenient, <em>and</em> they’re counting on not dealing with a flood of complaints. I plan on filing a complaint at the first <em>hint</em> of an off-color comment about what they’re doing. “Better get new gloves, Fred!” — “I’d like your name and your supervisor’s name, now.”</span>

                                I don’t really want to go to 3rd base with a TSA thug, but if we all do it, they’ll get frustrated as all hell.&nbsp; And a machine won’t feel bad if you curse at it, but snide remarks (that stay away from the realm of threats, or jokes about weapons, of course) can hurt the feelings of a TSA henchman.&nbsp; If nothing else, they’ll have to work instead of standing around.

                                Now, some of you will say that I shouldn’t be insulting a person who is copping feels and staring at naked photos of unwilling people in exchange for money.&nbsp; <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1849035">Ptacek has an answer to that</a>:

I’m generally very respectful of law enforcement. Fortunately (or not), I’m not forced to confront that conundrum, since these aren’t police officers, but low-skilled “security” contractors whose sole purpose is to harass citizens in order to create the illusion of control.</span>

                                This I don’t get.&nbsp; I mean, I get the practical reasons for being polite to people with guns and handcuffs.&nbsp; I even agree that people with guns and handcuffs deserve respect as long as they’re doing reasonable and important things. (For instance, I have no beef against the cop who knocked on my door recently to ask if I knew anything about an identity theft case that he was investigating.)&nbsp; What I don’t get is why a person might actually think that there is an ethical difference between a person who cops a feel while carrying a gun, and a person who cops a feel without carrying a gun.&nbsp; If you’re copping feels and taking naked photos of passengers who were given no choice in the matter, it doesn’t really matter to me what sort of uniform you wear.&nbsp; You’re doing bad things.
