                            <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/10/judge-tells-copyright-troll-righthaven-no-its-fair-use.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss"><img vspace="4" hspace="4" border="0" align="right" width="230" height="129" src="http://static.arstechnica.net/assets/2010/10/copyright-troll-gargoyle-ars-thumb-230x130-17417-f.jpg"></a>
                            <p>
                                Righthaven, the company that scours the Web for copies of <em>Las Vegas Review Journal</em> stories and then sues the posters for mad cash and their domain names, has hit a small bump on the copyright lawsuit superhighway. A federal judge has just tossed one of its many cases because the posting was a "fair use."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Righthaven has no problem going after small-time operators (read our <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/09/righthaven-saving-the-newspaper-industry-one-lawsuit-at-a-time.ars">profile of the company</a> and its tactics). In this case, it sued a Las Vegas realtor named Michael Nelson, who runs a small blog related to home ownership. Nelson put eight sentences of a 30-sentence <em>Review Journal</em> article in one of his posts, along with a link back to the paper; for this he was sued in federal court.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Righthaven demanded that his domain name should be locked and transferred to Righthaven. In addition, the company demanded "willful" statutory damages for copyright infringement, which can be as high as $150,000. (Righthaven sends no cease-and-desist letters before suing.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nelson fought back. In his court response, he accused Righthaven of "barratry," defined as "the offense of frequently exciting and stirring up quarrels and suits." The company "is using these lawsuits as a source of revenue. Such abuse of legal process should be rejected."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But more important was Nelson's claim that his use of the story had been fair. Judge Larry Hicks agreed with Nelson's Motion to Dismiss, finding that the "four factor" of copyright went in Nelson's favor. Though his site was commercial in nature, Nelson had copied only a part of the work, had used only the factual bit (as opposed to some commentary later on), and had done little to affect the market for the work. In addition, he linked to the <em>Review Journal</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Final verdict: "Nelson's use falls within the Fair Use doctrine." (The judge passed over the complaint about "barratry" in silence.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to a competing newspaper, the <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/oct/20/righthaven-defendant-wins-first-lawsuit-dismissal-/"><em>Las Vegas Sun</em></a>, this is the first such ruling in the 150+ lawsuits filed by the company to date (and it filed six new lawsuits yesterday alone). We've looked into a number of these cases, and Righthaven seems to have a bizarre indifference to context; while they often sue people who have posted entire articles, they will also sue those who have only published a few sentences or those who have served as key sources for the articles they copied. Perhaps the new ruling will cause Righthaven to get more selective about it cases.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Or perhaps not. As the <em>Sun</em> noted, Righthaven actually settled with Nelson just before the decision came down; terms aren't available, but it does seem likely that Righthaven got some money to make the problem go away.
