                                Darryl Shpak writes to me:

                            <p>
                                I came across the following surprising claim this morning; you might find it interesting:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "50 per cent of all words are negative, and only 30 per cent are positive, in both English and Spanish. So we tend to have a much more colorful, rich, negative vocabulary, and it's all because our brains are built to be particularly excited by negative things."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Darryl goes on:<br>
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    This was in an interview in Maclean's magazine with Prof. Clifford Nass from Stanford, on the topic of human-computer interaction. The interview is available online at <a href="http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/09/30/clifford-nass-in-conversation/">http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/09/30/clifford-nass-in-conversation/</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The claim seems obviously false on the surface: it only allows for 20% of words to be neutral, yet in any casual sampling of text, whether it's a couple of paragraphs from that very interview, or a page from a dictionary, or anything else I can find, I'm unable to categorize any more than a small minority of words as positive or negative, even under the most generous criteria.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I've done some web searching to try to find the source of this claim, but variations of the phrase "percent of words are negative/positive" have turned up no results except for that interview. Do you have any idea whether or not this is a misinterpretation or misstatement of a genuine statistic? Or is it complete fiction?
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Complete fiction would be my guess. For it to be serious, we'd need a way to measure negativeness (how negative is the word <i>negative</i>?), a decision on how to delineate people's vocabularies (you can't use a dictionary if it's full of words that most people don't actually know), and some serious quantitative work to count them all up. Where has this been done?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And what would it show? Why, if I keep muttering about administrative bullshit in memos, and <i>bullshit</i> checks out as a negative word, would that show that "our brains are built to be particularly excited by negative things"?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Classic nobody-will-try-to-check-it-if-it's-about-language bullshit, I'd say. And it does not excite my brain.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <font color="#007700">[But: see below for a measured and informative comment by Professor Nass, who explains that (a) he was sorely misrepresented, since his claim was supposed to be about a specific subpart of the vocabulary, and (b) there is at least some quantitative evidence to back up the claim. â€”GKP]</font>
