                                I’m sure all politicians careen between saying what they believe and spouting whatever crap will get them elected. But it seems like Republicans have adopted a universal strategy of popular deceit, and if they speak truth it’s only by coincidence. Here’s the pattern I’ve seen:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Toss out a slew of outrageous lies.
                                </li>
                                <li>Watch for one to capture the public’s imagination.
                                </li>
                                <li>Turn it into jargon (“death panel”) that sticks in voters’ heads.
                                </li>
                                <li>Step back from the lie when it’s debunked, and craft a milder (still dishonest) version. But keep the original jargon.
                                </li>
                                <li>Repeat as necessary. Debunkers eventually move on to tackle some new lie, leaving the last version in place and the jargon established.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Republicans sound like they’re conducting a giant experiment in saying whatever they can get away with, and I suspect they’re surprised as any of us by some of the results. That’s probably too harsh, though. What’s worse is that a good chunk of them might believe the stuff they say. That’s the difference between, for instance, Glenn Beck and Michele Bachmann. Either way, the country loses.

For now just note what Louie said about LGBT hate crime victims in 2007, “There were only 242 crimes where there was actually some — truly an assault.”

                                <li>Ignore anti-gay murders. These are listed in his source, just two columns over from the 242 number, but he doesn’t mention them. So killing gays doesn’t count.
                                </li>
                                <li>Ignore anything the FBI calls simple assault. Simple assault simply doesn’t count as assault to him. The FBI give an <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/handbook/ucrhandbook04.pdf">example</a> of simple assault:

                                    <em>A married couple was arguing about financial problems. The husband slapped his wife and left the house. The wife followed him, and they continued their argument. The police responded to a call by a neighbor. The wife told them that her husband slapped her.

                                Michele Bachmann is low-hanging fruit on the crazy tree, and this is one of her milder statements. Apparently she’s let her husband dictate her career, even entered fields she hated, because “the Lord says, Be submissive — wives, you are to be submissive to your husbands.” (1:37 into the clip).

For a long time, my favorite was her<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdjRFJQuoiI">belief</a> that swine flu only rages during Democratic administrations (not that there’s a link, mind you, <em>she’s just sayin’</em>…) — even though the other outbreak she mentions was under Ford, not Carter.

                                Randy Forbes wants to place the Lincoln-Obama Bible on permanent display upon the Lincoln table at the Capitol Visitor Center. He introduced a <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-hc34/text">resolution</a> with a long list of WHEREASs, <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-hc34/text?version=ih&amp;nid=t0:ih:13">one of which</a> was:

                                Randy must not know the First Amendment prohibits Congress from establishing a state religion. Randy’s shown his incompetence in other ways, too. He once opposed expanding hate crime protections to gays and lesbians by saying <a href="http://www.onenewsnow.com/Culture/Default.aspx?id=513142">this</a> of the Perez Hilton/Carrie Prejean Miss USA ruckus:
                            </p>

                                    We run into one reality: the rationing of care because you have to decrease the costs. There is always, always rationing and restrictions, which fall on the most weak.

                                Trent is right about the problem but wrong about the bill. There’s rationing already, done by health insurance companies that deny claims, terminate coverage, and refuse to insure those with pre-existing conditions. The reform bill tries to address those issues. “I’ll never vote for government-run healthcare,” Franks has said <a href="http://www.kingmandailyminer.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=33156">elsewhere</a>. But “government-run healthcare” is one of those scary, dishonest bits of Republican jargon. The bill doesn’t put the healthcare system under government control, or put treatment decisions in the hands of government bureaucrats.
                            </p>

                                It’s hard to cast Trent as a bad guy in this debate. He was born with a cleft palate, and his late brother had Down Syndrome. He has every reason to take a deep and sincere interest in how disabled kids will fare under reform. But that makes him all the more dangerous when he distorts the truth.

                                Trent portrays himself as a defender of moral values, but that doesn’t prevent him from entering half-truths into the public record. In his opposition to extending hate crime protections to gays and lesbians, he <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRIoiiIJQo8">spoke</a> of the “Philadelphia 11″:
                            </p>

                                    Eleven individuals were jailed and faced $90,000 in fines and 47 years in prison for simply speaking the Gospel openly and publicly.

                                Well, no. Trent doesn’t mention that police intervened when the eleven individuals tried to disrupt a publicly-permitted event and were charged with disorderly conduct after they ignored police orders to disperse for the sake of public safety. And ultimately none of them were tried under Pennsylvania’s hate crime statute, because these laws simply do not criminalize speech. Trent says none of that.

                                And by the way, existing hate crime legislation protects Christians (and other religious believers). Does his principled opposition include this protection, or was he moved to speak only when the gays got involved?

                                You almost expect this sort of lunacy at the lower levels of government. But everything else in the post came from our representatives in Congress. The Republican party today has little interest in developing constructive policy. Its reps would rather spend their energy offering up ridiculous claims to see if they can ride a wave of deceit back into power. Hopefully, they’ll just catch a riptide and get pulled further out to sea.
