                            <p>
                                <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/PH2010102101582.jpg"><img alt="PH2010102101582.jpg" src="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/assets_c/2010/10/PH2010102101582-thumb-228x295-27768.jpg" width="228" height="295" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"></a>Whether NPR should or should not have fired Juan Williams, they shouldn't have done it so quickly. Media organizations -- in fact, all organizations -- need to wait out these firestorms before they make these decisions. This was true for the Department of Agriculture and Shirley Sherrod, of course, but it was also true for CNN and Rick Sanchez. Responding to Internet frenzies at Internet speed is just a disaster. Waiting for the story to die down and then making a decision when it's easier to think clearly and would be preferable, and will, I think, come to be seen as an important management skill in the Internet age.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And speaking of management skills, the consensus seems to be that NPR wanted to fire Williams for some time, but hadn't been able to bring itself to do it. The crisis gave them the excuse they thought they needed. In reality, it did NPR much more damage than if they'd quietly declined to renew the guy's contract because they thought he wasn't adding enough to their airwaves any longer. You see this a lot, where institutions decline to make difficult management decisions when they're strong, and then have to make them when they're weak, like amid a PR problem or a recession. On a human level, it's understandable. No one likes firing employees. But it often does everyone more damage, as either it increases perceptions of the organization's weakness or releases employees at a moment when it's maximally difficult for them to find a new job.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But if NPR's decision was hasty and ill-timed, Fox's decision was, for a media company, basically inexplicable. Williams had just lost his bargaining power. He'd lost his second income. He'd become less employable. And so he got a ... giant raise? That's not how markets work. And it's not how the news business works.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It only makes sense if you don't look at Fox News as a news business, and you don't pretend they offered Williams $2 million for his irreplaceable political commentary. For a conservative lifestyle channel, this is good PR, and it lets you further the sense of persecution that keeps your audience coming back. For Roger Ailes, the chance to call Williams "an honest man whose freedom of speech is protected by Fox News on a daily basis" must be worth at least $500,000. And grabbing Williams is also an important precedent to set for other commentators who want to swing further right than their employers will allow: Making yourself a martyr against the politically correct, mainstream media can actually be quite lucrative.
