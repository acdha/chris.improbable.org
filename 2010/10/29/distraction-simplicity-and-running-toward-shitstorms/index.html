                                    It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.

                                <strong>Context</strong>: Last week, I pinched off one of my typically woolly emails in response to an acquaintance whom I admire. He’s a swell guy who makes things I love, and he'd written, in part, to express concern that my recent <a href="http://www.art-bin.com/art/omodest.html" title="'A Modest Proposal For Preventing The Children of Poor People in Ireland From Being A Burden to Their Parents or Country, and For Making Them Beneficial to The Public,' By Jonathan Swift">Swift</a> <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/1169153343/only-you" title="Kung Fu Grippe: Introducing 'ū—': A Distraction-Free Writing Environment">impersonation</a> had been directed explicitly at something he'd made. Which, of course, it hadn’t—but which, as I'll try to discuss here, strikes me as irrelevant.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To paraphrase <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/quotes" title="Casablanca Quotes">Bogie</a>, I played it for him, so now I suppose I might as well play it for you.

                                    There are at least a couple things that mean a lot to me that I'm still just not very good at.
                                </p>
                                <ul>

                                    </li>
                                    <li>Never explain yourself.

                                    I want to break both these self-imposed rules privately with you here. [Editor’s Note: <em>Um</em>.] Because, I hope to nuance the shit out of some fairly <em>un</em>-nuanced points. And, to do that, I'll also (reluctantly) need to explain myself. But, here goes.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    First [regarding my <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/1169153343/only-you" title="Kung Fu Grippe: Introducing 'ū—': A Distraction-Free Writing Environment">goofing</a> on “<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=distraction-free+writing+environment">distraction-free writing environments</a>”] I think there are some GIANT distinctions at play here that a lot of folks may not find nearly as obvious as I do:
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Tool Mastery vs. Productivity Pr0n</strong> – Finding and learning the right tools for your work vs solely dicking around with the options for those tools is just <em>so</em> important, but also <em>so</em> different. And, admittedly, it’s almost impossible to contrast those differences in terms of hard &amp; fast rules that could be true for all people in all situations. But, that doesn’t make the difference any less qualitatively special or real.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        Similarly…
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>
                                            <strong>Self-Help Vs. “Self”–“Help”</strong> – Solving the problem that caused the problem that caused the problem that caused the symptom we eventually noticed. Huge. Arguably, peerless.
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Viz.: How many of us ignore the actual <em>cause</em> of our problem in favor of just reading dozens of blog posts about how to “turbocharge” its most superficial symptoms? Sick.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>
                                            <strong>Focus &amp; Play</strong> – Yes, focusing on important work is, as Ford used to say, Job 1. But, that focus benefits when we maintain the durable and unapologetic sense of play that affords true creativity and fosters an emergence of context and connection that’s usually killed by stress. BUT.
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Again, what conceivable “rule” could ever serve to immutably declare that “THIS goofing-off is critical for <a href="http://keck.ucsf.edu/~loren/Discoveries.html">hippocampal plasticity</a>” vs. “THAT goofing-off is just <a href="http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics">dumb, distracting bullshit</a>?”
                                            </li>
                                            <li>

                                                    <em>Impossible</em>. Because drawing those kinds of distinctions is one of our most important day-to-day responsibilities. Decisions are hard, and there’s no app or alarm gadget that can change that.
                                                </p>

                                                    <li>Although, they certainly can help mask the depth of the underlying problem that made them seem so—what’s the parlance?—“<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=indispensible+applications+productivity#sclient=psy&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=1..5000+intitle%3Aindispensable+applications+OR+apps+OR+programs&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=7c8f32f65b860aba">indispensable</a>”.

                                    All that stuff? That there’s a complex set of ideas to talk about for many complex reasons—not least of which being how many people either despise or (try to) deny the unavoidable impact of ol' number six.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But, here’s the thing: as much as saying so pisses anybody off, I think the topics we're NOT talking about whenever we disappear into Talmudic scholarship about “full-screen mode” or “minimalist desks” or whatever constitutes a “zen habit”—those shunned topics are precisely the things that I believe are most mind-blowingly critical to our real-world happiness as humans.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In fact, I believe that to such a degree that helping provide a voice for those unpopular topics that can be heard over the din is now (what passes for) my career. I really believe these deeper ideas are worth socializing on any number of levels and in many media. Even when it’s inconvenient and slightly disrespectful of someone’s business model.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So, that’s what I try to do. I talk about these things. Seldom by careful design. Often poorly. But, always because they each mean an awful lot to me.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    […]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But, no matter how I end up saying whatever the hell I say, I believe in saying it not simply to be liked or followed or revered as a “nice guy” who pushes out shit-tons of <em>whatever</em> to “help people.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Because, believe me, friend, a great many of those apparently “nice guys” swarming around the web “helping people” these days are ass-fucking their audience for nickels and calling it a complimentary colonoscopy. And, while I absolutely think that in itself is empirically <strong>wrong</strong>, I also think it’s just as important to <strong>say</strong> that it’s wrong. Sometimes, True Things need to be said.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Which in this instance amounts to saying, a) selling people a prettier way to kinda almost but not really write is not, in the canonical sense, “nice”—but, far worse, b) leaving your starry-eyed customers with the nauseatingly misguided impression that their “distraction” originates from anyplace but their own busted-ass brain is <strong>really</strong> not “helping.” Not on any level. It is, literally, <em>harmful</em>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “Helping” a junkie become more efficient at keeping his syringe loaded is hardly “nice.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It’s the opposite of nice. And, it’s the opposite of helpful. These are my True Things.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And, to me, saying your True Things also means not watering down the message you care about in order to render it incapable of even conceivably hurting someone’s feelings—or of even conceivably losing you even one teeny-tiny slice of that precious “market share.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Well, that’s the price, and I'm fine paying it—best money I've ever spent.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But, it also means trusting your audience by letting each of them decide to add water only as <em>they</em> choose to—by never corrupting the actual concentrate in a way that might make it less useful to the smartest or most eager 5% of people who'd like to try using it undiluted. Because, at that point, you're not only abandoning the coolest people you have the honor of serving—you risk becoming a charlatan.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And, that’s precisely what you become when you start to iteratively inbreed the kind of fucktard audience for whom daily buffets of weak swill and beige assurance are life’s most gratifying reward.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Sure. Those poor bastards may never end up <em>using</em> any of that watery information to do anything more ambitious than turbocharging their most regrettable symptoms. But, who’s the last person in the universe who’s going to grab them by the ears and tell them to get back to work? Exactly—that same “nice guy” whose livelihood now depends on keeping infantalized strangers addicted to his “help.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Holy shit—no way could I ever live with that. It’s so wrong, it’s not even right. <code>ESC, ESC, ESC!</code>
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    Okay. So anyhow, there’s a really long-winded, overly generous, and extremely pompous way of trying to say I don’t know how to do what I do except how I do it. But, I do genuinely feel awful when innocent people feel they have been publicly humiliated or berated simply because I'm some dick who hates people.

                                    When I was a kid, I thought my Mom was “mean” not to let me play in traffic on busy Galbraith Road. Today, I'm not simply grateful that she had the strength and resolve to be so “mean”—I actually can’t imagine how sad it would be to not have people in your life who care enough about your long-term welfare to tell you to stop fucking around in traffic. To where you eventually might start even seeking 12x-daily safety hacks from some of the very same drivers whose recklessness may eventually kill you. Wow.

                                    Admitting when life is complicated or things aren’t shiny and happy all the time strikes me as a wonderfully sane and adult way to conduct one’s life. That there are so many folks offended by even the existence of this anarchic idea is not a problem I can solve.

                                I may admire your work, too. Especially if you care a lot about that work and don’t overly sweat peoples' opinions of it. Most definitely including my own.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For these purposes, it doesn’t really matter whether we're friends and, honestly, it doesn’t even matter whether I love, use, or agree with everything you do, say, or make in a given day.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It doesn’t matter because good work doesn’t need <em>me</em> to love it. Like tornadoes and cold sores, good work happens with total disregard to whether I'm “into it.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But, conversely, let’s stipulate that the points-of-view undergirding our opinions—again, including mine—will and should survive either agreement or <em>lack of agreement</em> with equivalently effortless ease. Because, like <em>really</em> good work, a <em>really</em> good point-of-view doesn’t require another person’s benediction.

                            <p>
                                Now, to be only vaguely clearer here, I'm not posting this circuitous ego dump in the service of altering your opinion of either me, my friend, his work, or practically anything else for that matter.
                            </p>

                                But, I would love it if we could all be more okay with the fact that real life means that we do each have a different, sometimes incongruous, and often totally incompatible point-of-view. Yes. <em>Even you</em> have a point-of-view that <strong>someone</strong> despises. Ready to change it now? Jesus, I sure hope not.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then, to be only slightly more clear, I'm also not advocating for that fakey brand of web-based <em>kum ba ya</em> that gets trotted out alternately as “tolerance” or “inclusion” or some styrofoam miniature of “civility.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'm absolutely not <em>against</em> all of those things when authentically practiced, but I'm also really skeptical of the well-branded peacemakers who are forever appointing themselves the Internet’s “Now-Now-Let’s-All-Pretend-We're-Just-Saying-the-Same-Useless-Thing-Here” den mothers.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                And, it infantalizes some important conversations when we tacitly demand that any instance of honest disagreement be immediately horseshat into a photo opp where some thought leader gets to hoist everyone’s hands in the air like he’s fucking Jimmy Carter.

                                Doing that annoying hard stuff is how you grow, get better, and learn what <em>real</em> help looks like. Even if that’s not the answer you wanted to hear. You get better by getting your ass out of your RSS reader and fucking making things until they suck less. Not by buying apps.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You don’t whine about distractions, or derail yourself over needing a nicer pencil sharpener, or aggravate your chronic creative diabetes by starting another desperate waddle to the self-help buffet. No. <em>You work</em>.

                                And, for what it’s worth, just like you can’t get to the moon by eating cheese, you'll also never leave boot camp with your original scrote intact by telling your drill sergeant to try using more honey than vinegar.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                No. That sergeant’s <em>job</em> is to make you miserable. It’s his <em>job</em> to break down your callow conceits about what’s supposed to be easy and fair. It’s his <em>job</em> to emotionally pummel you into giving up and becoming a Marine.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You? You're not there to give the sergeant notes; you're there to sleep two hours a night, then not mind getting beaten for 20 hours until a decent Marine starts to fall out.

                                Like most humans, I like things I can understand. Like most readers, I love specificity. Like most thinkers, I love clarity. Like most students, I love relevance and practicality. And, like most busy people, believe it or not, I actually do really like it when someone gets straight to the point.

                                But, here’s the problem. If my 2-year-old daughter asks me about time travel, and I blithely announce, “E=mc<sup>2</sup>”, I will have said something that is entirely specific, clear, relevant, practical, and/or straight-to-the-point. For <em>somebody</em>.
                            </p>

                                She'd probably either laugh derisively at me (which she’s great at), or she'd pause and ask, “<em>Whuh dat?</em>” (which she’s even better at).
                            </p>

                                Thing is, her understanding that jumble of characters less than me—and my understanding it WAY less than Professor Al—has zero impact on the profundity, truth, beauty, or impact of the man’s theory.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sure. You could quite accurately fault me for being a smartass and a poseur, and you could even berate my toddler for her unaccountably shallow understanding of <em>Modern Physics</em>. But, in any case, you can’t really blame either Albert or his theory.

                            <p>
                                Specifically, Albert can’t begin to tell us what he <em>really</em> knows if we don’t understand math.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, let’s say this theory you've been hearing about really interests you. And, let’s also pretend, just for the sake of the analogy, that you haven’t completed <em>Calculus III</em> (212) or <em>Quantum Mechanics</em> (403) or even something as elementary as, say, <em>Advanced Astrophysics II</em> (537). I know <em>you</em> have. Obviously. But, let’s pretend. Where do you start?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well, you could read some tips about learning math. You could find a list of 500 indispensable resources for indispensable math resources. You could buy a new “distraction-free math environment.” Heck, there’s actually nothing to stop you from just declaring yourself a “math expert.” Congratulations, Professor.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Thing is: <em>you still don’t know math</em>.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Which means you still can’t <em>really</em> understand the theory—no more than a pathetic Liberal Arts refugee like me or a dullard Physics ignoramus like my kid can <i>really</i> grok relativity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Difference is, you will have blown a lot of time hoping that actual expertise follows non-existent effort—while my daughter and I get to remain total novices without charge. Only, we don’t get all mad at the theory as a result; a staggering number of fake math experts <em>do</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I mean, be honest—after all that recreational non-work and make-believe dedication almost trying to kinda learn math sorta—you might actually get frustrated at how brazenly Al defies your fondness for shortcuts by continuing to rely on so many terms and proofs and blah-blah-blah that you still just don’t understand. So annoying.

                                You may simply decide that Albert Einstein’s a huge dick for never saying things that can be completely understood solely by scanning a headline.

                                But, Al just told the truth.

                            <p>
                                Problem is, Al’s truth not only <em>requires</em> fancy things in order to be truly understood—the more of those fancy things you take away from his truth, the less true it gets. And, by the time it’s been diluted to the point where you're comfortable that you understand it? You'd be understanding the wrong thing. Even I can understand that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But, not one bit of <em>any of this</em> is Al’s fault. Al doesn’t get to control who uses, abuses, gets, or doesn’t get what he said or why it matters. Especially since he’s been dead for over fifty years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All I know is, regardless of who has ears to hear it on a given day, it would be to Al’s credit never to mangle something important in order to get it into terms everybody’s ready to handle without actually trying.
                            </p>
                            <p>

Trouble is, if you <em>did care</em> even a little, it’s impossible to even say how much you're missing since you can’t be bothered to soldier through the source text. The text itself is the entire point.

                                Sometimes, complex or difficult things stop being true when you try to make them too simple. Sometimes, you have to actually get laid to understand why people think sex is such a thing. Sometimes, you need to learn some Greek if you <em>really</em> want to understand <em>The Gospel of John</em>. And, yeah, sometimes, you're going to have to just work unbelievably hard at whatever you claim to care about before anyone can begin to help you get any better—or less “distracted”—at it.

Watching a Rankin-Bass cartoon about the Easter Bunny will teach you very little about the intricacies of transubstantiation. And, if you can’t be troubled to care so much about your work that you reflexively <em>force</em> distractions away, dicking around with yet another writing application will merely aggravate the problem.
