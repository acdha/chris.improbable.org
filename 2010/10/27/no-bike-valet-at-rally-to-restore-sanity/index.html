                                    That's insane. As will trying to find something to lock your bike to on the mall. I know I've had to hunt for something during Screen on the Green - and that is nothing compared to what is expected on Saturday. <a href="http://waba.org/blog/2010/10/the-economics-of-the-bike-valet/">WABA explains</a> that they tried, but they just can't afford to fund this on their own.
                                </p>
                                <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                    Sometimes we’ll accept the loss of a little money if it means we can encourage a ton of people to bike. Sometimes we’ll do a valet where we don’t think it will be heavily used if it allows us fund further bike advocacy efforts or WABA programming.
                                </p>
                                <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                    But as the scale gets larger, the risks go up for us.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In the end, the problem is with the NPS application process (there has been a lot of complaining about NPS lately).
                                </p>
                                <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                    If you want bike valets in the future, let event organizers know that you expect it. And let NPS know that you’d like to see bike parking considered when they’re granting permits for giant rallies and events in our backyard.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <a href="http://www.tbd.com/blogs/tbd-on-foot/2010/10/john-stewart-rally-bring-your-good-times-and-your-laughter-but-not-your-bicycle-3736.html">TBD has more coverage</a>
                                </p>
                                <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                    WABA reached out unsuccessfully to rally organizers for weeks. By the time they finally got a hold of someone, “they didn’t want to change their plan,” he said.
                                </p>
                                <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                    Based on crowd estimates, WABA staff figured the Stewart rally could be on a scale with the Obama inauguration, an event for which they ran <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/15/bike-valets-for-inauguration-day/">a large and successful valet</a>. WABA would have charged rally organizers around $3,000 for the service. (We’ve asked a Comedy Central spokesperson if anyone will be providing bike facilities at the event; we’ll update if we hear back.) Short of running a valet, WABA was hoping they could at least rent out some temporary lockup stations so cyclists wouldn’t get stranded with their bikes. That didn’t pan out, either.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    $3000 is like a one week residual check for "Big Daddy." TBD offers advice.
                                </p>

                                    The nearest spot with large-scale bike parking is probably outside the Union Station Metro stop. But those racks might disappear quickly, too. Other relatively nearby options are to the south of the House office buildings, on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2nd+and+d+streets+se,+washington+dc&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=D+St+SE+%26+2nd+St+SE,+Washington,+District+of+Columbia,+20003&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=F07HTJ3mFoP6lwfx_4j5AQ&amp;ved=0CBcQ8gEwAA&amp;ll=38.88482,-77.003753&amp;spn=0.006781,0.018239&amp;z=16">C and D streets SE</a>, or up on the hill behind the Capitol, on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=3nd+and+east+capitol+streets+ne,+washington+dc&amp;sll=38.888494,-77.001135&amp;sspn=0.006363,0.018239&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16">2nd and 3rd streets SE and NE</a>. Hoagland thinks these areas east of the dome are the best bet, since everyone’s first instinct will be to find a spot in Penn Quarter.
