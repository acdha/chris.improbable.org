                        <blockquote>
                            <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/09/wil-shipley-we-tried-to-do-too-much-for-delicious-library-2.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss"><img vspace="4" hspace="4" border="0" align="right" width="230" height="129" src="http://static.arstechnica.net/assets/2010/09/shipley_dl25-thumb-230x130-16095-f.jpg"></a>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/" title="Delicious Monster">Delicious Library</a> is, by all accounts, a very successful Mac OS X application. The software has won numerous accolades, including two Apple Design Awards and a Macworld Eddy. Creator Wil Shipley often brags about how much money he makes from sales, and won't hesitate to mention how fun it is to drive the Lotus Elise he bought with profits he's earned.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Despite his bravado, however, Shipley can admit when he makes a mistake. On the release of the 2.5 update to Delicious Library, he told Ars that the ambitious plans for Delicious Library 2.0 ending up resulting in a finished product that, while beautiful and impressive looking, performed poorly for some users. That's why version 2.5 consists largely of bug fixes and performance enhancements, and instead of adding features takes a few away.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "So, the big realization with 2.0 is that I tried to do too much," Shipley told Ars. "Which is, you know, like being in a job interview and saying your biggest fault is you work too hard. But it turned out to be a big disservice to my customers," he explained.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The original Delicious Library used an XML-based database file to keep track of all your books, CDs, and DVDs. Perhaps its most interesting feature was the ability to use an iSight as an inexpensive barcode scanner. But the XML-based database became a performance issue as collectors with large libraries—the sort that would be heavy users of the software—began cataloging all their media.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2008/05/do-not-adjust-your-browser-delicious-library-2-is-out.ars" title="Ars Technica: Do not adjust your browser: Delicious Library 2 is out">Delicious Library 2</a>, Shipley wanted it to be a "really valuable" update since, as a major version, it would be a paid upgrade. To improve performance, the old database code was stripped out and replaced with new code based on Apple's CoreData APIs. That change alone would be upgrade worthy, since "people with over a couple hundred items could add, remove, or edit an item and it wouldn't take 30 seconds to save—it'd take 0.03 seconds."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But that wasn't all; Shipley also wanted to add whiz-bang new UI graphics and animations made possible with CoreAnimation APIs, as well as improve display performance. "We rewrote the entire display layer, as well, and got it so we could scroll through thousands of items and maintain 20fps or so on any decent hardware," he said. That's a bigger deal than it might sound, though—"it took the entire iPhoto team like three versions before they could handle that many hi-res images," Shipley noted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So Delicious Library 2 would ship with a whole new back- and front-ends—in effect, it was like a whole new product. But Shipley didn't stop there; instead, DL2 piled on new features, including a whole list of new product categories it could track, like video games, tools, and other items. It also added web exporting with iWeb integration, a companion iPhone app (which was later dropped due to API limitations set by Amazon), library sharing with friends, improved AppleScript support, and more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The problem is, the sheer amount of changes meant potential for bugs and other problems. "Let's say, for instance, 80 percent of these features worked great," Shipley explained. "I'd think, 'Yay, I did good, I added a bunch of great stuff to the new version, it was definitely worth $20 to existing customers.' But, that's not how the customers see it—they see the 20 percent that's buggy, and they think, 'This is crappy… he released software that didn't work.'"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Shipley said there were a variety of reasons that some of the bugs got through testing. For instance, a memory leak in the display of PNG graphics led to major performance hits and eventual crashes for users with thousands of items. Unfortunately, no one expected users with these huge libraries to attempt to publish their collections to the web. "Who has that kind of time? Well, it turns out, die-hard collectors do," Shipley said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Other problems came from attempting to adopt Apple's latest technologies in Leopard, and later, Snow Leopard. So the bugs in new APIs were reported to Apple in the hope they would be fixed, but sometimes required less-than-ideal workarounds in the interim.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ultimately, however, the user isn't concerned with the causes of bugs, only that they happen. And when the bugs cause problems or crashes, users stop using new features, or the product entirely. "It teaches you shyness—[users] are afraid to try things because the machine will 'punish you,'" Shipley said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The take-away? "If I'd just cut the flaky features, and only shipped the stuff that was really solid, people would have had a much better impression of the app," Shipley told Ars.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And take away he did. SFTP-based web publishing was removed recently since it relied on a external library that was produced by someone else, and Shipley couldn't guarantee its performance. For version 2.5, iWeb publishing was removed, since the format Apple uses is private and difficult to reverse engineer. "We thought we had it figured out, but re-publishing something in iWeb would remove all the graphics we added."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition, Shipley hired an additional developer, and the pair made it a goal to ramp up performance and eliminate the top 20 bugs. "The decision was, make stuff work or cut it," Shipley said. Those top 20 bugs were responsible for 90 percent of user complaints, he explained.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Honestly, this should have been done a long time ago," Shipley said. But two major roadblocks prevented that work from happening. First was Snow Leopard, which required a lot of work to keep DL2 compatible. The other was the revised iSight used in newer iMacs released since late 2009. The fixed focus point was different because the screens were so large that users were sitting farther away. But that little change required four to five months of work completely reengineering the barcode scanning algorithms.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Still, the 2.5 update improves performance from ten- to a hundred-fold on large libraries. And, there is an <a href="http://delicious-monster.com/downloads/Delicious%20Library%202/Delicious%20Library%202-r12044.html">extensive number of bug fixes</a>, from the common to the esoteric. Even better, 2.5 is a free and automatic update for all Delicious Library 2 users.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And, with its main product in a stable form, Shipley's company Delicious Monster is now free to work on new software. While Shipley wouldn't give us any specifics about what he has in store, we do know that it will be something for iOS. Would it include a way to scan or photograph items in your collection to add them to a library. "You might imagine that," Shipley teased cryptically.
