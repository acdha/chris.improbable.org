                            <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/09/apple-relaxes-restrictions-on-ios-app-code-iad-analytics.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss"><img vspace="4" hspace="4" border="0" align="right" width="230" height="129" src="http://static.arstechnica.net/assets/2010/09/young-steve-glint-thumb-230x130-16274-f.jpg"></a>
                            <p>
                                Recent revisions to the iOS developer agreements caused considerable controversy by restricting which programming languages could be used to develop iOS apps. Those changes also restricted what kind of analytics data could be collected by developers and advertisers. Now, however, Apple has backed off on its position: it will relax these rules in order to give developers more flexibility. Additionally, Apple will now actually publish a list of app review guidelines for developers—the first time the company has done so since the App Store launched more than two years ago.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The controversy ignited when Apple released the first betas of iOS 4 to developers. Those betas came with revisions to the iOS Developer Agreement, which governs what developers are allowed to do when creating iPhone and iPad apps. In particular, section 3.3.1 <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/04/apple-takes-aim-at-adobe-or-android.ars" title="Ars Technica: Apple takes aim at Adobe... or Android?">restricted the development languages to Objective-C, C, or C++</a>. This would have locked out a number of third-party development platforms, which allowed developers to use JavaScript, C#, and even Flash to develop native iOS apps.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Section 3.3.2 limited the use of scripting languages to aid development or to run in the app itself. One particularly popular use of scripting was the use of Lua to help control game logic. Apple later <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/06/devs-cautiously-optimistic-about-ios-4-nonnative-code-change.ars" title="Ars Technica: Devs cautiously optimistic about iOS 4 nonnative code change">relaxed this particular rule</a> to allow developers to request exceptions, perhaps because it discovered that some of the most popular games on the platform would be negatively affected by the rule. This early change made developers cautiously optimistic that Apple was willing to compromise for the benefit of developers and the platform.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, Section 3.3.9 of the developer agreement strictly limited which analytic information developers and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/06/apple-welcomes-indie-advertising-companies-shuts-out-admob.ars" title="Ars Technica: Apple welcomes indie advertising companies, shuts out AdMob">third-party advertising networks</a> could collect. Developers often collect analytic information to help understand how users are interacting with an app, in order to improve it in future iterations. Advertisers use analytics to improve how and what ads are delivered and to provide advertisers with necessary information about an ad's effectiveness. In particular, the analytics restrictions provide iAd an advantage over some larger mobile ad networks, such as the Google-owned AdMob.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Apple said Thursday morning that feedback from developers led to relaxing restrictions from these sections of the developer agreement, though it's hard to believe that an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/06/reports-ftc-to-investigate-apple-for-mobile-policies.ars" title="Ars Technica: Reports: FTC to investigate Apple for mobile policies">FTC investigation into the restrictions</a> wasn't a factor as well. Whatever the cause, developers should have much more freedom in deciding how best to build their apps.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "In particular, we are relaxing all restrictions on the development tools used to create iOS apps, as long as the resulting apps do not download any code," Apple said in a statement released to the press. "This should give developers the flexibility they want, while preserving the security we need."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These changes should allow developers to use whatever development environments or languages suit them, as long as the resulting code doesn't use unapproved or private APIs and can be compiled into native iOS code. Even the iPhone development tools included in Flash CS5 should be able to be used to create iOS apps without restriction. Developers should also be able to continue to collect analytic data assuming that data does not compromise a user's privacy. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Apple did not respond to our questions about any potential changes for third-party advertisers by publication time, though. Presumably, mobile ad firms owned by competing platforms will still face some restrictions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In another big change for developers—one they have been asking for for over two years now—Apple will publish official guidelines used to review App Store submissions. With these guidelines, developers will be able to evaluate before and during development if their app stands a chance of being approved for sale. Previously, Apple only used internal guidelines, and developers were <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2008/09/apples-app-store-schizophrenia-driving-developers-crazy.ars" title="Ars Technica: Apple's App Store schizophrenia driving developers crazy">often frustrated</a> to have apps <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/05/iphone-app-rejection-madness-still-hasnt-stopped.ars" title="Ars Technica: iPhone app rejection madness still hasn't stopped">rejected by unwritten rules</a> they weren't aware of until after the fact. "We hope it will make us more transparent," Apple said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Given the explosive success of the App Store, it's in Apple's best interest to make developers' lives a little easier. Despite how long it took Apple to make these changes, hopefully they will put many developers' concerns to rest.
