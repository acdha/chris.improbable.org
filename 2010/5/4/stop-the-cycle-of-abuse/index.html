                                George Alan Rekers is a big enemy of the gays.&nbsp; He’s a junk scientist who testifies against us in court.&nbsp; How bad does it get?&nbsp; Here’s a quote from <a href="http://www.aclu.org/files/images/asset_upload_file16_37906.pdf">the official transcript</a> of a case in which he freaked out the judge with his testimony:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Dr. Rekers astounded the Court when he testified that he favors removal of any child from a homosexual household, even after placement in that household for ten years, in favor of a heterosexual household. To this Court’s further astonishment, the witness hypothesized that such a child would recover from the removal from his family of 10 years after one year in a heterosexual household.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>

                                This same professionally anti-gay Baptist minister was just discovered coming back from a 10-day vacation with his traveling companion, a “sensual,” “wild,” “up-for-anything” young man he met on…rentboy.com.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    On April 13, the “rent boy” (whom we’ll call Lucien) arrived at Miami International Airport on Iberian Airlines Flight 6123, after a ten-day, fully subsidized trip to Europe. He was soon followed out of customs by an old man with an atavistic mustache and a desperate blond comb-over, pushing an overburdened baggage cart.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That man was George Alan Rekers, of North Miami — the callboy’s client and, as it happens, one of America’s most prominent anti-gay activists. Rekers, a Baptist minister who is a leading scholar for the Christian right, left the terminal with his gay escort, looking a bit discomfited when a picture of the two was snapped with a hot-pink digital camera.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Reached by <em>New Times</em> before a trip to Bermuda, Rekers said he learned Lucien was a prostitute only midway through their vacation. “I had surgery,” Rekers said, “and I can’t lift luggage. That’s why I hired him.” (Though medical problems didn’t stop him from pushing the tottering baggage cart through MIA.)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Yet Rekers wouldn’t deny he met his slender, blond escort at Rentboy.com — which features homepage images of men in bondage and grainy videos of crotch-rubbing twinks — and Lucien confirmed it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At the small western Miami townhome he shares with a roommate, a nervous Lucien expressed surprise when we told him that Rekers denied knowing about his line of work from the beginning. “He should’ve been able to tell you that,” he said, fidgeting and fixing his eyes on his knees. “But that’s up to him.”
                                </p>

                                My first reaction was triumph, an arrogant, “YES!&nbsp; More proof that the stupid evil motherfuckers who drive gay teens to suicide and work to destroy our families are just psychologically damaged freaks trying to flee their own personal demons!”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But there’s another reaction.&nbsp; This man <em>is</em> damaged.&nbsp; He <em>is</em> trying to flee his demons.&nbsp; He’s been subject to a lifetime of religious and psychological abuse.&nbsp; He’s an old man now, and he’ll never know what his life could have been.&nbsp; Is it so hard to feel compassion for him?&nbsp; And if I don’t, wouldn’t it be good for my soul to try?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And then there’s realism.&nbsp; He’s a victim of abuse, and now he’s perpetuating the abuse.&nbsp; It’s the usual cycle — the victims of one generation become perpetrators against the next.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That’s how I think we should talk about this incident.&nbsp; It’s dehumanizing — to him and to us — to gloat over this poor wreck of a life.&nbsp; Yet we have a human duty to protect others from Rekers and his colleagues in deceit.&nbsp; Don’t caricaturize him as a villain exposed.&nbsp; Present him instead as a victim-turned-abuser, a perfect symbol of the cycle — the vicious, hateful machine — we’re trying to break.
                            </p>
