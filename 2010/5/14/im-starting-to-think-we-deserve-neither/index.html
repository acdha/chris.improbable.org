                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">

                                        At a <a href="http://www.ewi.info/dallas">security conference</a> recently, the moderator asked the panel of distinguished cybersecurity leaders what their nightmare scenario was. The answers were the predictable array of large-scale attacks: against our communications infrastructure, against the power grid, against the financial system, in combination with a physical attack.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I didn't get to give my answer until the afternoon, which was: "My nightmare scenario is that people keep talking about their nightmare scenarios."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There's a certain blindness that comes from worst-case thinking. An extension of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle">precautionary principle</a>, it involves imagining the worst possible outcome and then acting as if it were a certainty. It substitutes imagination for thinking, speculation for risk analysis, and fear for reason. It fosters powerlessness and vulnerability and magnifies social paralysis. And it makes us more vulnerable to the effects of terrorism.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Worst-case thinking means generally bad decision making for several reasons. First, it's only half of the cost-benefit equation. Every decision has costs and benefits, risks and rewards. By speculating about what can possibly go wrong, and then acting as if that is likely to happen, worst-case thinking focuses only on the extreme but improbable risks and does a poor job at assessing outcomes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Second, it's based on flawed logic. It begs the question by assuming that a proponent of an action must prove that the nightmare scenario is impossible.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Third, it can be used to support any position or its opposite...
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Of course, not all fears are equal. Those that we <a href="http://www.schneier.com/essay-170.html">tend to exaggerate</a> are more easily justified by worst-case thinking. So terrorism fears trump privacy fears, and almost everything else; technology is hard to understand and therefore scary; nuclear weapons are worse than conventional weapons; our children need to be protected at all costs; and <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9905448-7.html">annihilating the planet</a> is bad. Basically, any fear that would make a good <a href="http://www.schneier.com/essay-087.html">movie plot</a> is amenable to worst-case thinking.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Fourth and finally, worst-case thinking validates ignorance. Instead of focusing on what we know, it focuses on what we don't know -- and what we can imagine.
                                    </p>

                                    Adding to that analysis,&nbsp;political pressure tends to militate in favor of lending more and more credence to worst-case-scenario validation and prevention - at least, this has been the case for exaggerated fears like terrorism.&nbsp; On that note, <a href="http://progressiverealist.org/blogpost/countering-terror-eroding-justice">Charli Carpenter links</a> to a Glenn Greenwald piece that, in her words, describes the unseemly "shift from denying basic human rights to non-US terror suspects under Bush/Cheney, to denying such rights to American citizens under Obama/Biden."&nbsp; Quoting Greenwald:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">

                                        A bipartisan group from Congress sponsors legislation to strip Americans of their citizenship based on Terrorism accusations. Barack Obama claims the right to assassinate Americans far from any battlefield and with no due process of any kind. The Obama administration begins covertly abandoning long-standing Miranda protections for American suspects by vastly expanding what had long been a very narrow “public safety” exception, and now Eric Holder explicitly advocates legislation to codify that erosion. John McCain and Joe Lieberman introduce legislation to bar all Terrorism suspects, including Americans arrested on U.S. soil, from being tried in civilian courts, and former Bush officials Bill Burck and Dana Perino — while noting (correctly) that Holder’s Miranda proposal constitutes a concession to the right-wing claim that Miranda is too restrictive — today demand that U.S. citizens accused of Terrorism and arrested on U.S. soil be treated as enemy combatants and thus denied even the most basic legal protections (including the right to be charged and have access to a lawyer).

                                    Consider this: our nation is on the verge of enshrining (or already has enshrined) a raft of legislation and quasi-legislation that will greatly erode the quality and durability of civil liberties for U.S. citizens for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; These fundamental changes being proposed, and those already undertaken,&nbsp;are&nbsp;largely in response to a few bumbling attempts at terror attacks (one with a failed underwear fuse and another with a&nbsp;bomb made of <em>bottle rockets and Miracle-Gro</em>.*&nbsp;

                                    Of course, 9/11 was a far more serious matter, but 9/11 was also almost a decade ago, and pointing to that event does little to explain the ever-increasing encroachment on civil liberties gathering speed under an administration that purported to&nbsp;hold those rights in higher regard.&nbsp; Regardless, even 9/11 doesn't justify treating the accused as the convicted.
