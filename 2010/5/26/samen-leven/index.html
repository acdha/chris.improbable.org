                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                It occurs to me that, while we have this quiet time on Making Light, I could do a few background posts on life in the Netherlands. And one of the most important concepts of the culture here, one that keeps surprising and educating me, is <em>samen leven</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The term literally means "to live together". It's one of the core values of Dutch culture: the concept that no matter how much we differ, we all have to find a way to not just coexist but actively cooperate. The simplistic folk-sociological explanation of this is that it's a crowded country with a shared objective: keep our feet dry, keep the sea back. And I suspect there's more than a grain of truth in that, though there are similarly crowded cultures that have used other strategies, such as reticence, to the same effect.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the Dutch are famous for their bluntness; I think they could give up cheese more easily than they could speaking their minds. So the <em>samenleving</em> is a safety net, a guarantee that even the most extreme views* will be tolerated†.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Samen leven</em>, like all forms of tolerance, is challenged by the existence of intolerance. In the Netherlands these days, that clash is usually between conservative immigrant groups, particularly some (but not all) communities who trace their roots to Muslim countries‡ and right-wing politicians such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pim_Fortuyn">Pim Fortuyn</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geert_Wilders">Geert Wilders</a>. Whether the Muslims are being intolerant or their opponents are is hotly debated on all sides of society (with, of course, due attention to and consideration of all views).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In any case, Rush Limbaugh would not get much of an audience here.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the Dutch are good-humored about their passion for tolerance. My bike is not the standard Dutch bike; it's a rams-horn touring bike. A colleague said that I wasn't really living the Dutch lifestyle with a bike like that. My only reply was, "Samen leven." And he laughed, and withdrew the allegation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                More seriously, <em>samen leven</em> is as deeply rooted in Dutch culture as an explicit love of liberty is in America. Like liberty, like any cardinal value, the single-minded pursuit of that kind of tolerance is probably more of a weakness than a strength, but it's an interesting and challenging mindset for an American to encounter and live together with.
                            </p>
                            <hr>
                            <small>* There are exceptions. The culture is also passionately committed to both caring for its children and granting them freedom from an early age. Harming children is <em>not</em> tolerated.<br>
                            † The word usually translated as "tolerance", <em>gedoogbeleid</em>, is used in the context of Dutch drug law rather than the exchange of views. But it's all part of the same picture.<br>
                            ‡ The native conservative Christian community is as committed to live together with people it disagrees with as the rest of the country. Pretty much, anyway.</small>
