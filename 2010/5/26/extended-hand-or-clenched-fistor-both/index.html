                                    <em>by Eric Martin</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Flyntt and Hillary Mann Leverett <a href="http://progressiverealist.org/blogpost/obama-steps-americas-covert-war-against-iran">discuss</a> recent revelations about an extensive use of military personnel in various friendly, and non-friendly nations in the Middle East/North Africa/Central Asia&nbsp;region.&nbsp; These would be military operations undertaken absent a public debate (or even legislative debate)&nbsp;about the merits of what are extremely risky and potentially costly activities.&nbsp; The Leverett's focus on the fact that such activities vis-a-vis Iran undermine the ostensible engagement with, and extension of a hand to, Iran as claimed by the Obama administration:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        When, in an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/opinion/24leverett.html">Op Ed published in The New York Times in May 2009</a>, we first criticized President Obama’s early decision to continue covert anti-Iranian programs he inherited from George W. Bush, some expressed disbelief that Obama would undermine his own rhetoric about engaging Tehran in a climate of mutual respect by conducting a dirty war against the Islamic Republic.&nbsp; But, in an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/world/25military.html">important piece of reporting published today in The New York Times</a>, Mark Mazzetti documents that Obama has not just failed to roll back covert anti-Iranian programs he inherited from his predecessor—he is instead presiding over a dramatic intensification of America’s covert war against the Islamic Republic.&nbsp; And, in a manner powerfully reminiscent of Bush and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, the intensification of America’s covert war against Iran is taking place through the efforts of General David Petraeus and CENTCOM—because military intelligence operations are not subject to the same congressional oversight and reporting requirements as the Central Intelligence Agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We excerpt the critical passages from Mazzetti’s article below:&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p>
                                            “The top American commander in the Middle East has ordered a broad expansion of clandestine military activity in an effort to disrupt militant groups or counter threats in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and other countries in the region, according to defense officials and military documents.&nbsp;
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The secret directive, signed in September by Gen. David H. Petraeus, authorizes the sending of American Special Operations troops to both friendly and hostile nations in the Middle East, Central Asia and the Horn of Africa to gather intelligence and build ties with local forces.&nbsp; Officials said the order also permits reconnaissance that could pave the way for possible military strikes in Iran if tensions over its nuclear ambitions escalate.”
                                        </p>
                                    </blockquote>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    As alluded to by the Leveretts, the use of Special Operations forces is fast becoming a favorite vehicle for policymakers and military leaders seeking to circumvent legal prohibitions and other statutory requirements.&nbsp; They are the do-ers of the dirty work, availing themselves of methods, tactics and actions that are at worst illegal and, at&nbsp;best render the implementation of population centric counterinsurgency doctrine a schizophrenic mess.&nbsp; For example, Special Operations units in Afghanistan are the&nbsp;groups&nbsp;implicated in&nbsp;the infamous "Night Raids" that have terrorized the local population.&nbsp; As previously&nbsp;discussed&nbsp;on <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2010/04/paper-kittens.html">this site</a>:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        These Night Raids often involve unprovoked killings, and even when the suspects are detained, they are frequently subjected to torture, abuse and are further deprived of rights.&nbsp; Not exactly a tactic likely to win over hearts and minds.&nbsp; One recent Night Raid-gone-bad has made news due to the tragic results (three women were killed, two of them pregnant), as well as an apparent attempt to <a href="http://www.newshoggers.com/blog/2010/04/us-and-allied-forces-we-killed-those-pregnant-afghan-women-after-all.html">cover up</a> events.
                                    </p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Special Operations are the ones that, allegedly, are doing the detaining and torturing as well - a convenient workaround&nbsp;to prohibitions on such behavior.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is unclear to what purpose they are being put under the current policy regime reported by the <em>Times</em>.&nbsp; The Leveretts, again, return to the topic of engagement with Iran:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        In our criticism of President Obama’s early decision to continue the anti-Iranian covert programs he inherited from his predecessor, we compared his lack of strategic vision to the statesmanship of President Richard Nixon—who, on coming to the White House in 1969, ordered the CIA to stand down from a longstanding covert action program in Tibet, to show Beijing that he was serious about rapprochement with the People’s Republic of China.&nbsp; As we predicted early on, Obama is, unfortunately, headed in exactly the opposite direction.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        President Obama’s policies are not only generating risks for innocent, non-official Americans.&nbsp; They are further eroding the already deteriorating prospects for an improvement in U.S.-Iranian relations—and increasing the chances of an eventual U.S.-Iranian military confrontation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    </p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p dir="ltr">
                                    I can't imagine how sending in Special Operations forces who have grown accustomed to a certain amount of autonomy and outside-the-rules latitude could lead to that.&nbsp; Sarcasm aside, aren't these the types of decisions that should involve Congress, and shouldn't the American people have a right to know in what ways we might be triggering even more large scale military conflicts/blowback/anti-American animus?
                                </p>
