                            This is particularly worth discussing because there's an easy libertarian position (equalizing baseline opportunity to participate) which could support the civil rights act without embracing heavy-handed government; as it is, it's hard to avoid a non-racist interpretation.<br>
                            <br>
                            As an aside, it's fascinating to see the wave of apologia where smart, well-educated people perform semantic heroics trying to pretend there's some deeper logic in what is obviously just a case of someone who is not particularly thoughtful being given a high-profile opportunity to reveal it. There must be a term which includes the level of desperate cognitive dissonance needed for such a defense.

                                This post is theme-and-variations on <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2010/05/24/rand-paul-civil-rights-sherpa-conservatism-special-history-and-badges-and-incidents/">my previous one</a>. The issue: Barry Goldwater is lionized as an icon of conservative high principle and true philosophy. But his signature domestic issue was opposition to integration and civil rights legislation. If – like Rand Paul a week ago – you think his opposition was philosophically and Constitutionally correct and admirable, then bully for you. But if – like Rand Paul today, like most conservatives – you think Goldwater was wrong to oppose integration and civil rights legislation, then you need to explain how Goldwater’s conservative conscience failed him so utterly and comprehensively. One possibility: he was personally just a racist or opportunist, and that overrode his principles. But no, this answer is not accepted (by conservatives). Well then: either 1) he espoused wrong principles, or 2) he mis/over-applied them in some way.
                            </p>

                                Conservatives are going to go for 2), overwhelmingly. This is the position that <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2010/05/24/rand-paul-civil-rights-sherpa-conservatism-special-history-and-badges-and-incidents/#comment-318180">Sebastian took in comments</a>, in response to <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2010/05/24/rand-paul-civil-rights-sherpa-conservatism-special-history-and-badges-and-incidents/">my last post</a>. “But all the political philosophies break down at ugly margins.” This is the position <a href="http://trueslant.com/conorfriedersdorf/2010/05/24/thoughts-on-goldwater-contd/">Conor Friedersdorf takes</a> in his most recent post.

                                But Mr. Goldwater was a failure as a politician, a builder of coalitions, and as an adept translator of principle into policy. The right lionizes Ronald Reagan for those things, whereas the enlightened way to lionize Barry Goldwater is as a man of principle who practiced his main virtue to a fault. To borrow a line from Ross Douthat, today’s Goldwater apologist should say, “no ideology survives the collision with real-world politics perfectly intact. General principles have to bend to accommodate the complexities of history, and justice is sometimes better served by compromise than by zealous intellectual consistency” — so while I admire Barry Goldwater for articulating and sticking to first principles, which were generally correct, I also wish like hell he would’ve abandoned zealous consistency in the singular instance of Civil Rights.

                                This was all that Rand Paul needed to admit, after his victory in Kentucky’s Republican Senate primary, when <span>NPR</span> and Rachel Maddow asked about his views of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. “As a principled critic of federal power,” he could have said, “I oppose efforts to impose Washington’s will on states and private institutions. As a student of the history of segregation and slavery, however, I would have made an exception for the Civil Rights Act.”
                                <p>
                                    But Paul just couldn’t help himself. He had to play Hamlet, to hem and haw about the distinction between public and private discrimination, to insist on his sympathy for the civil rights movement while conspicuously avoiding saying that he would have voted for the bill that outlawed segregation.

                                All this seems to me philosophically and politically untenable.

                                First, if we are going to get all ‘consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds’ about our philosophies, we need to drop all leg-pulling about principle. And, no, this isn’t some higher insistence on consistency, it’s a point about character. If you are a pragmatic trimmer, you are not a champion of high principle. Being a trimmer while preening yourself on your pure adherence to principle is not some sort of wise balancing act. This is important in the Goldwater case because a Goldwater who said and did all the things Goldwater is admired for – all that ‘conscience of a conservative’ stuff – who reversed course and supported integration and civil rights legislation, wouldn’t have been ‘an adept translator of principle into policy’. He would have been an 18 karat gold-plated phony. Which is, I take it, nobody’s ideal of virtue and authenticity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So it’s very hard for me to make sense of Friedersdorf’s phraseology when he says – let me quote again – “while I admire Barry Goldwater for articulating and sticking to first principles, which were generally correct, I also wish like hell he would’ve abandoned zealous consistency in the singular instance of Civil Rights.” To me this translates: Goldwater would have been a better conservative if he’d been less committed to conservatism. Or, even more harshly: since Americans are philosophical conservatives but operational liberals, what you do to win is adopt a sham rhetoric of conservative principle, while crafting actual policy in accordance with liberal principles, which will produce better results, and better match up with what people actually want. The problems with this are manifold and I will note but one: to recommend that, say, Rand Paul should take this path amounts to recommending that he turn <span>RINO</span>. He should promise all sorts of conservative stuff until he gets to Washington, at which point he will judiciously adapt all that into policy, i.e. totally fail to deliver.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I don’t think Friedersdorf would agree with this at all – I’m sure he wouldn’t – for the following reason: recognizing the injustice of Jim Crow is not a case of pandering or trimming. It’s not just putting your finger up to see whether the wind is blowing left or right. Conservatives should be in favor of civil rights legislation, not because they’ll be killed at the polls if they aren’t, but because you should do the right thing. <em>Now</em> the rubber hits the road. But let’s shift into reverse for a second. What is the actual <em>point</em> of saying things like ‘consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds’? The point can be pragmatic. Politics is the art of the possible; consistency is often impossible. Coalitions must be assembled. There are horses that need trading, sausage that must be made. But it can be more philosophical: you should be a pluralist about values because that’s the correct philosophy. You should acknowledge that there are large principles, incommensurable values, and they sometimes collide in confusing ways, that can’t be solved for to three significant decimal places. Freedom and equality, tradition and progress, individualism and community, universalism (cosmopolitanism) and patriotism. There are no higher principles that really tell you how to balance these things. It takes good judgment. This is a thing that gets us back to pragmatic ability to see what is really possible, what really works, what real life is like. And now the trick is to tell trimming – stuffing sausage with trimmings from the dirty backroom floor – from Trimming – Stuffing The Sausage of This Mortal Coil With Trimmings From Our Solid Earthly Existence. (As William James said: “the trail of the human sausage is over all.” Or words to that effect.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now I expect Friedersdorf will say: yes, the noble one, if you please, not the sordid one. And now the problem is: congratulations, you’re a liberal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because what is really going on in the civil rights case? What incommensurability of values is it that induces us to bend or blend our principles in such a case, according to Friedersdorf and Douthat? Well, obviously, it’s something like freedom vs. equality [beyond bare formal political equality]. Or negative freedom vs. positive freedom. Or justice, as a relationship between private individuals, to justice, as a positive institutional/social arrangement. Or regarding people as individuals vs. thinking of them in terms of groups or classes. It obviously isn’t totally clear which way of thinking about the issue is best, philosophically. But the problem with suggesting that the conservative principle should be bent, in these sorts of cases, is that the principle that we are going to be bending is the one that says, precisely, that you shouldn’t be willing to bend your principles in cases like this. At the philosophical level, the balancing act approach is not some wise compromise between conservative and liberal principle. The balancing act <em>is</em> the dreaded liberal philosophy. So to engage in the balancing act is not to compromise but to concede. Conservative principle is that <em>we are not even going to set foot on the road to serfdom</em>, because that leads to serfdom. This means we need to stand up for individual freedom against <em>any and all attempts to balance individual freedom against some progressive social engineering ideal of what society should be like</em>. If it turns out that it’s actually right, in practice, to balance principles of individual freedom against principles of progressive social engineering, then the conservative principle is not bent but broken.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now maybe there’s some other way to think about what the relevant conservative principle is in this case, but I haven’t heard it. It’s obvious that we are not looking for some mellow, Burkean thing, in the case of civil rights. It seems there is a tendency to retreat into vague claims that ‘race is special’, or ‘the history of race makes it special in the US’. But I would like to hear some explanation of why this is so. In comments, Sebastian <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2010/05/24/rand-paul-civil-rights-sherpa-conservatism-special-history-and-badges-and-incidents/#comment-318174">objected</a> that it’s completely obvious why we can carve out a morally unique exception here, that won’t touch other sorts of cases. “Surely you’re aware of the racial component to slavery in the US. Right?” Yes, I was aware, but I fail to see the overwhelming moral relevance of this historical fact. How does the fact that some people owned other people 150 years ago override the value of individual liberty today, by conservative lights? Conservatives tend to mock those who would make policy out of feelings of historical guilt. (If they are serious that it’s all about the slavery: do they think the problem in the 60’s was not that some people couldn’t sit at lunch counters but that the ancestors of those who couldn’t sit at lunch counters had been slaves? So if only we had Jim Crow from time immemorial, rather than as a legacy to slavery, it would be ok?) I invite conservatives like Friedersdorf and Douthat – as I invited libertarians like Bernstein and Barnett, in my last post – to explain why they think civil rights legislation, in the 1960’s, required a departure from principle, without conceding that the principle turns out to be mostly just a rhetoric of principle, masking acknowledgment that, in practice, the principle is wrong.
