The death toll was expected to rise.

                                        Greater international attention and sympathy to the plight of Palestinians suffering under the Israeli-Egyptian- (and U.S.) enforced siege of Hamas-ruled Gaza is precisely what Israeli authorities were hoping to avoid. In the days and weeks leading up to the launch of the flotilla, the Israeli government and its <a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/tobin/302256">American</a> <a href="http://www.arabist.net/blog/2010/5/31/how-israeli-hasbara-works.html">mouthpieces</a> were hard at work both to <a href="http://www.themajlis.org/2010/05/27/idf-helps-to-debunk-israeli-claims-on-gazas-economy">downplay the extent of the humanitarian crisis</a> in Gaza, and to <a href="http://www.israelnewsagency.com/gazafreedompeaceflotillahamasshipsisraelidfihhpalestineislamicjihadterrorismalqaedaturkeyturkishreliefhumanitarianrelieffoundation48052910.html">present the flotilla’s sponsors as supporters of terrorism</a>. (The <a href="http://www.arabist.net/blog/2010/5/31/how-israeli-hasbara-works.html">evidence for the latter claim</a> seems to amount to the usual game of “Six Degrees of Osama bin Laden,” wherein everyone who has ever contributed money to a Palestinian cause is linked to global jihadism.)

                                            They knew it was a dangerous situation, and they were shocked but not surprised when James Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman were abducted and killed by the KKK as the project just got going. There were many other acts of quasi-official violence meted out to the volunteers, and while the organizers obviously would have preferred to have avoided all of that, they expected it and it was part of their strategy. The largely but not entirely unstated reasoning was that the country would continue to ignore massive violence directed towards the African-American community in Mississippi, but could and would not remain oblivious to similar violence directed towards young, white, middle-class college students from New York City and other metropolitan centers. This, indeed, proved the case. The violence directed at the Mississippi Freedom Summer shocked the conscience of the country and was among the numerous decisive moments in the civil rights movement that ultimately succeeded in dismantling the apparatus of formalized racism in the United States.

                                        Like segregation in the American South, the siege of Gaza (and the entire Israeli occupation, for that matter) is a moral abomination that should be intolerable to anyone claiming progressive values. It’s sad that it should require the deaths of non-Palestinians to finally shake the international community from apathy and inaction, but, as with the tragic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_civil_rights_workers_murders">murders of Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner</a>, if it contributes to ending the situation then that’s a positive outcome.

                                        Unfortunately, the killings will also likely result in the strengthening of support for Hamas vis a vis more moderate Palestinian leaders, greater unrest and more violence, which is not.

                                    The blockade of Gaza is at best marked by  depraved indifference to massive human suffering, and quite possibly a war crime.  The use of armed commandoes to raid humanitarian ships in international waters leading to such loss of life is, also, a despicable act.
