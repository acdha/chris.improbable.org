                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                This is all a prolegomenon to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/apr/23/historian-orlando-figes-amazon-reviews-rivals">what is going on</a> in historical circles in England at the moment. The deservedly distinguished historian of modern Russia, Orlando Figes, has been caught with his pants down. He has been writing reviews, on Amazon.com, trashing his rivals’ books. He has also been writing reviews praising his own books. After a week of threatening and blustering, talking of libel suits, and then <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/apr/18/amazon-orlando-figes-books">blaming his wife</a> (a distinguished law professor in her own right), he <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Orlando-Capriccioso/23424/">admitted</a> to his actions.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>[A]fter a week of questions and increasingly critical headlines, Figes today revealed that he had been responsible for the comments.
                                </li>
                                <li>He apologized to [those] "to whom I gave incorrect information"--for actions he called "stupid", adding: "Some of the reviews were small-minded and ungenerous, but they were not intended to harm."
                                </li>
                                <li>He described a state of panic when he first saw the email sent by [a rival whom he criticized], which made him instruct his lawyer "without thinking this through rationally."
                                </li>
                                <li>"This escalated the situation," he said, "and brought more pressure on myself by prompting a legal response. My wife loyally tried to save me and protect our family at a moment of intense stress when she was worried about my health. I owe her an unreserved apology."
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                At the moment, according to his college, “he is on sick leave and we are offering our support.” No doubt he is consulting Tiger Woods about the appropriate therapy.<br>
