                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <img src="http://teddziuba.com/images/why-is-it-that-militant-atheists-never-say-anything-bad-about-jews.jpg">What's with all the hate on my generation? It started when somebody quit Jason Calacanis's industrial web spam startup, Mahalo, for a higher paying position at a competitor. Invariably, Calacanis went apeshit on the poor guy in a very public way, and this started a cascade of blogosphere butthurt about people in software under thirty: that we're unreliable, that we're lazy, that we're entitled.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well I'm as unreliable, lazy, and entitled as the next guy, but that's not why I've hopped jobs in the past. People in my generation have a very low tolerance for bullshit, and software engineering, in general, is a very high bullshit career. If you couple that with the standard load of bullshit you would get from a non-technical Harvard MBA type boss — like many CEOs that you find trying to get rich in Silicon Valley by hiring some engineers to "code up this idea real quick" — it's no wonder that a good engineer will walk off the job after his one year cliff vesting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As an engineer, you are told that you're "lucky to have a job", because there are "a hundred people lined up outside, ready to take it". (As chance would have it, there are at least a thousand lined up to take the job of <em>rich prick who tells people what to do</em>). This backlash is the product of diseased thinking. A CEO who makes an engineer work 80 hours a week is a driven entrepreneur, but an engineer asking for a comfy chair is a prima donna. So, when we are up to our knees in golf-course, martini-lunch bullshit, don't be surprised when we jump ship for a higher salary.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I recognize the value of business people and management. Somebody has to sell the code that I write, which in turn puts food on my table. Since I <em>am</em> an engineer, I like iterative optimization. Every time I have left a job, I have further refined the requirements that a person must fill before I agree to work for him. After every job, I add one or two requirements to the list, and I have found that my happiness at work improves dramatically with every step.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is my current list:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The organization must need me at least as much as I need it.
                                </li>
                                <li>My direct manager must have a technical background — enough to understand why programming is hard.
                                </li>
                                <li>My direct manager must have enough experience or raw intelligence such that I can trust him/her to make decisions, even though I may not understand the reasoning.
                                </li>
                                <li>I must have absolute faith in the business plan.
                                </li>
                                <li>I must have absolute faith in "the business side" to execute that plan.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                So, Jason, when that fellow quit Mahalo, he didn't just leave you in the lurch. He added something to his list. Maybe you should find out what that is.
                            </p>
