                            <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/05/glenn-becks-war-on-the-fcc-and-satan-worshippers.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss"><img vspace="4" hspace="4" border="0" align="right" width="230" height="129" src="http://static.arstechnica.com/assets/2010/05/glenn_beck_list-thumb-230x130-14018-f.jpg"></a>
                            <p>
                                Right-wing talker Glenn Beck <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,592610,00.html">took to his Fox News TV program last Monday night</a> to deliver a rant about how President Obama has compiled something "almost like an enemy's list" and how Obama is into "silencing opponents." The president's tool of choice for this censorship? Network neutrality—the principle that ISPs <em>cannot</em> interfere with content.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "We are dealing with people who think they should rebel until they get their little kingdom like Satan did," said Beck. "You know what? Thanks, Mr. President, but I think we're going to keep the Internet the way it is right now. You know—or at least until people who are worshipping Satan, you know, aren't in office."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The mechanism by which net neutrality will silence Beck and those like him remains murky, but the matter is clearly of great concern.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "The FCC also says they are marching forward, marching with a boot on your throat to— announcing plans to make Internet companies a public utility," he said. "Net neutrality—the court shot that one down, but they are going to make it a public utility now."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Or again: "So now, the president wants to regulate the Internet, to help control all the misinformation out there. He is going to do it with net neutrality. Well, the court said no... So, now what they're doing is the FCC is just going to—they're going to make it a public utility. The Internet. Where are you, America, without the Internet?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The entire segment was driven by a recent Obama speech to graduates in which the president described the challenges of "coming of age in a 24/7 media environment that bombards us with all kind of content and exposes us to all kind of arguments, some of which don't always rank that high on the truth meter."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (Beck interjected, "Oh no, let's ban that!" when replaying the clip.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "With iPods and iPads and Xboxes and Playstations—none of which I know how to work—information becomes a distraction, a diversion," continued Obama.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Obama's particular remark here might sound noncontroversial, but Beck has always claimed to see the secret truth lying beneath the banal words—in this case, that Obama will use the FCC to shut him down. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's not often that you hear about the inner workings of the FCC on cable news, especially coming from one of TV's most popular talkers. But Beck has mounted a one-man war on the FCC for the last 18 months, and he is determined to keep the "Marxists" from silencing him.

                                Back in April, Beck <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,590506,00.html">railed against net neutrality</a>, saying that "it's about eliminating traditional, constitutional points of view from the public arena. But that's not the way it's being billed. It is about stopping debate. But nobody will tell you that. It's about ending free speech. It is about Marxism."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Julius Genachowski, a former tech executive who worked with startups and media mogul Barry Diller, is pushing unfettered Marxism? The idea is risible, but Beck seems to believe that the FCC has been infiltrated by radical groups who will help to implement Obama's secret censorship agenda. Chief among these groups is Free Press, the nonprofit that pushed the FCC to censure Comcast for its P2P blocking. (Genachowski's press secretary previously worked for the group.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "The FCC is being inundated by a special interest group ironically named Free Press, whose goal it is to limit America's free press and freedom of speech," said Beck in April. "But you see, Free Press isn't about free speech. It's about Marxism. It's about silencing dissent. Free Press is an oxymoron started by an oxy-Marxist. His name is Robert McChesney. In addition to cofounding Free Press, he's also the former editor of <i>The Monthly Review</i>. This is a self-proclaimed, independent socialist magazine—I don't want to call names—an openly Marxist publication. It sounds like a free press advocate so far, doesn't it?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                McChesney, a professor at the University of Illinois, certainly has no kind words for the current media system. He's been writing on the subject for decades, and sees US media outlets as "hype-commercialized" entities that distort the news. Here's how he described the problem of a corporate viewpoint in a <a href="http://acheret.co.il/en/?cmd=articles.323&amp;act=read&amp;id=2041">2009 interview</a>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    One example of the way this prejudice influences the news is the way that the story of prisons in the United States is ignored in the press and other media. The United States has a huge prisoner population. Twenty-five percent of all prisoners in the world are incarcerated in the United States. The only countries that have ever topped us in this are nations like Nazi Germany, Stalin's Soviet Union and South Africa under apartheid. But for our papers and TV, this is a nonstory, because the prisoners and their families are all poor, in the bottom 15-20 percent of the economic hierarchy. They no more exist for the media corporations than the untouchables in India. If the prisoners consisted of half the graduating class of Yale University, it would be the most important in history. This kind of noncoverage undermines the most fundamental tenets of journalism.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Another classic example is the way trade issues are covered in the US press: trade agreements almost always are portrayed as tremendously beneficial. Anyone who covers this story in a different way is considered an absolute fool or primitive.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In actuality, trade deals, negotiated under the direct guidance of monopolistic firms, are tremendously complicated, with thousands of specific exceptions tailored to corporate needs. What you get in the press is corporate propaganda 101. If you read the news media, you think that the business world is run by genius entrepreneurs.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                These sound like legitimate points of media criticism, but Beck picks up more colorful statements like this one <a href="http://socialistproject.ca/bullet/246.php">from 2009</a>: "Advertising is commercial propaganda; or, as the great critic James Rorty put it in the 1930s: 'advertising is our master’s voice.' Advertising is the voice of capital. We need to do whatever we can to limit capitalist propaganda, regulate it, minimize it, and perhaps even eliminate it."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                McChesney makes such statements on a regular basis. In the same interview, he railed against the telcos and cable companies. 
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    They are not any good at the actual business of telecommunications service provisioning. In the realm of Internet service provision, the telephone and cable companies play a parasitic and negative role. They do nothing positive. Their future is predicated on their ability to privatize the Internet and force people to use their version of it and pay exorbitant highway robbery prices for that use. This applies to cell phones companies as well. All of these firms rank in the bottom five of the most hated industries in the country, with the banks and other predatory lenders...
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At the moment, the battle over network neutrality is not to completely eliminate the telephone and cable companies. We are not at that point yet. But the ultimate goal is to get rid of the media capitalists in the phone and cable companies and to divest them from control.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>

                                McChesney favors much more public financing of media, which he sees as essential to democracy. He also wants the Internet to become "a public utility," which is apparently where Beck got the idea that he now ascribes to the FCC. (The current push to apply a handful of "Title II" rules to the ISP industry has nothing to do with making them into some sort of public utility.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "We want an Internet where you don’t have to have a password and that you don’t pay a penny to use," said McChesney. "It is your right to use the Internet. The benefits of a public Internet are numerous. It would end the digital divide, which remains a very serious problem in the US and worldwide."
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                A long war

                            <p>
                                Beck has been hammering McChesney and Free Press for months, arguing that they are forcing their agenda through the FCC. In October 2009, for instance, he spent an <a href="http://www.glennbeck.com/content/articles/article/198/31640/">entire segment on McChesney</a> and on Free Press' influence on the agency. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While Free Press has certainly been effective, its big win in the Comcast proceeding came when the FCC was led by Republicans—the arrival of Genachowski has certainly not led to some kind of headlong rush into socialism.

                                Accurate or not, though, Beck's rhetoric has stung. At an event organized by Free Press this week, president Josh Silver <a href="http://www.freepress.net/press-release/2010/5/11/josh-silver-we-must-summon-courage-advance-smart-media-policy">took a dig at Beck</a> and others who oppose net neutrality.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Industry front groups have even started to make McCarthy-esque allegations against our organization, painting our efforts to protect consumers and promote critical journalism as part of a 'Marxist' government takeover of the Internet," said Silver.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Because nothing Free Press actually says or does remotely reflects their rhetoric, they recycle out-of-context quotes from one of our cofounders. Or they draw up elaborate conspiracy theories. It is the province of liars and scoundrels."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The shot at "industry front groups" appears targeted at organizations like Americans for Prosperity, which has been <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Americans_for_Prosperity">largely funded by one of the biggest private companies in the US</a>, Koch Industries. The group takes positions against tobacco regulation, climate change legislation, and network neutrality rules.

                                Americans for Prosperity has been targeting Free Press for months. In February, the group compiled a <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.americansforprosperity.org%2Ffiles%2FFree_Press_Boldly_Deceptive.pdf&amp;pli=1">five-page handout of brief quotes from Free Press backers and staffers</a>, from which Beck appears to have drawn his examples.

                                Beck makes no secret of the connection. Announcing a segment of his show, he once noted, "There is a tremendously important FCC hearing going on this week on net neutrality. Special thanks to Phil Kerpen of Americans for Prosperity for alerting me while I was on vacation about this." 
                            </p>

                                Americans for Prosperity last week announced a $1.4 million ad buy to attack net neutrality.

                            <p>
                                Beck sees all sorts of enemies to his freedom of speech—net neutrality being only one of many at the FCC. According to Beck, FCC proceedings on "<a href="http://www.fcc.gov/localism/">localism</a>" (forcing public spectrum license holders to have local input into programming) and "diversity" (seeking broader representation among spectrum license holders, like TV and radio stations) have the same goal as net neutrality: censorship of conservatives.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The two principles, localism and diversity, combine to form a "new Fairness Doctrine," in the <a href="http://www.glennbeck.com/content/articles/article/196/25003/">words of a Beck guest from May 2009</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beck has long agued that the old Fairness Doctrine, which required "equal time" for opposing points of view on contentious issues, will return in some other form to keep down conservative commentators, which have been hugely successful on talk radio and now on Fox News.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "I said a few months ago don't pay any attention to the Fairness Doctrine, they are going to come at this from a different angle entirely. And the angle that I predicted, but you have even more is localism," he told his guest, author Brian Jennings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to Jennings, here's what localism will bring:

                                    The FCC in January 2008 issued a 97-page rule-making <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-07-218A1.pdf">report</a> (PDF) in which they eight times mentioned they would like to install and mandate programming advisory boards for every radio station in America. And what that means is this group would have oversight over the Glenn Beck show and every radio station in America. This group, organized by the community organizer himself, Mr. Obama, would be made up of far left liberal groups like ACORN, like radical Islamists. They could go in and if you didn't match up to what they wanted to hear on that radio station, they could go in and complain to the FCC, you would be subject to potential fines and license revocation.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                This is, to put it mildly, a dystopian and unlikely vision of localism. The reality is that even a staunch conservative like FCC Commissioner Deborah Taylor Tate <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-07-218A5.pdf">could say</a>, when that report was released, "The use of the public’s airwaves comes with weighty responsibilities and I will continue to encourage the furtherance of the goals of competition, diversity, and localism."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And Republican chairman Kevin Martin <a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-07-218A2.pdf">said</a> at the time, "The changes we propose are intended to promote localism by providing viewers and listeners greater access to locally responsive programming including, but not limited to, local news and other civic affairs programming. Most importantly, we tentatively conclude that all broadcasters must air a certain amount of local programming. I believe such a requirement is at the heart of what it means to be a local broadcaster."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While fellow Republican Robert McDowell did express skepticism about having local boards who would weigh in on broadcaster programming, the localism proceeding has not been pushed through by ACORN or radical Islamists. It may have its problems, but it happened under some very non-Marxist Republicans.
                            </p>

                                The same is true of the diversity push at the FCC, which is long-standing, though Beck has been <a href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/seton-motley/2010/01/04/glenn-beck-revisits-ample-evidence-against-fcc-diversity-czar-mark-llo">hammering the new diversity boss</a> at the FCC, Mark Lloyd, by name.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In September 2009, Beck took to <a href="http://twitter.com/glennbeck/status/3749169499">Twitter</a> and asked his followers to "FIND EVERYTHING YOU CAN ON CASS SUNSTEIN, MARK LLOYD AND CAROL BROWNER. Do not link before burning to disc." Lloyd has been mentioned numerous times on Beck's shows, and after Beck helped bring down Obama green jobs advisor Van Jones, Lloyd was next on his list.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lloyd was a lead author on the 2007 study "<a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/06/pdf/talk_radio.pdf">The Structural Imbalance of Political Talk Radio</a>" (PDF). The document came from the Center for American Progress, but was co-written with Free Press. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In it, the authors write, "Our analysis in the spring of 2007 of the 257 news/talk stations owned by the top five commercial station owners reveals that 91 percent of the total weekday talk radio programming is conservative, and 9 percent is progressive."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The authors claim that this is due, in large part, to a structural issue involving corporate, national control of radio, not some pent-up demand to hear only conservative voices. The report argues that requiring broadcasters to have more local ownership and getting more representative owners will naturally produce a more balanced landscape of opinion—without Fairness Doctrine-type regulation of content.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "The disparities between conservative and progressive programming reflect the absence of localism in American radio markets," says the report. "This shortfall results from the consolidation of ownership in radio stations and the corresponding dominance of syndicated programming operating in economies of scale that do not match the local needs of all communities. This analysis suggests that any effort to encourage more responsive and balanced radio programming will first require steps to increase localism and diversify radio station ownership to better meet local and community needs."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The top solution proposed is limiting the number of stations one entity can own so as to encourage a wider range of owners and therefore a wider range of viewpoints.

                                Beck's views on the FCC and its programs matter due to the influence he wields—for both sides of these debates.

                            <p>
                                Since January 1 of this year, Beck's name has appeared in more than 2,000 FCC comments.

                            <p>
                                For instance, an <a href="http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/ecfs/comment/view?id=6015570662">April 26 comment</a> in the net neutrality docket comes from Chris in Orange, California, who tells the FCC: "Glenn Beck speaks the truth and that is free speech, the left-wing ideology are using free speech to destroy free speech and THAT IS FREE SPEECH, but i have faith that people will reject the socialist/marxist/communist mentality to return this country to pre-America revolution era. When the human soul hears the truth being spoken they will know it as truth and will not be able to turn away from it without turning on its own human nature to be free.

Progressive liberals were all for the internet in getting Obama elected and now want to 'neutralize' the market. Give me a break! What's good for the goose is good for the gander. I am not a right-wing Glenn Beck zombie. Actually neither is Glenn. I am an individual American who believes in the Constitution of the United States of America and the free market system. I believe in the founding principles of this great country. AND thank God for people like Glenn Beck who remove the shroud of progressive ideology. Live Free or Die."

                                But Beck is also the demon in FCC comments about "Media and Information Needs of Communities In A Digital Age."—itself a controversial new FCC docket.

                            <p>
                                "I am very concerned that programs like Glenn Beck are passing for news, and that Fox News has found technical ways of making their programming absorbing when it is actually trash. Not sure what a free society does about this, but it is a huge concern. Listeners are being lied to and groups like Media Matters have to monitor the lies. This does not happen with NBC or ABC or CBS," wrote a <a href="http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/ecfs/comment/view?id=6015588079">commentor from Ashland, Virginia</a>.

                                His tremendous popularity as a TV personality/radio commentator/author/stand-up comedian earns him <a href="http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2010/0426/entertainment-fox-news-simon-schuster-glenn-beck-inc.html">$32 million a year</a>, according to a recent profile. "I could give a flying crap about the political process," Beck said in that piece. "We're an entertainment company."

                                Beck raises some useful points for debate when talking about localism and diversity initiatives at the FCC, but they are so over-the-top that they don't produce interesting discussion.

                                When it comes to net neutrality, the statements are even stranger: objecting to FCC involvement in network management is a legitimate topic. So is worrying about the effects that neutrality rules might have on investment. But the idea that Obama and Free Press and the FCC will somehow use net neutrality to silence Glenn Beck is simply odd—how would having ISPs treat IP packets more equally affect Beck at all? Even the Christian Coalition <a href="http://www.cc.org/ccnews/great_victory_christian_coalition_america_net_neutrality">supports the FCC on this</a> because it would protect conservative voices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By handling these issues the way he does, Beck unfortunately makes real debate more difficult—though at least millions of Americans now know <em>something</em> about diversity, localism, and net neutrality. Unfortunately, they also "know" that Obama worships Satan, that the Internet is about to become a "public utility," and that the FCC will shut down conservatives with network neutrality.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And Beck's war against the FCC shows no sign of slowing anytime soon.
