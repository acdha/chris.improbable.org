                                A German cybercrime forum was hacked by attackers who have exposed the underground dealings of the criminal denizens. The hackers snagged the database containing what appears to be all the private correspondence of the forum members, and posted it to the web.

                            <p>
                                The hackers also posted information on the IP addresses forum members used when they signed up for membership, noting that most of the administrators and moderators on the site didn’t use a proxy to access it. They also posted usernames, e-mail addresses and some cracked passwords of members, who number 5,000. The data was posted to the RapidShare file-trading site.

                                The hack was first reported by <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/05/fraud-bazaar-carders-cc-hacked/">Brian Krebs</a>.

                                Carders.cc was hacked through a poorly secured web server, according to the attackers, who disclosed their method and reason for hacking the forum in an <a href="http://pastebin.de/6648Z">e-zine they published with one of the data files</a>:

                                    Many of you guys may have noticed this breeding German “underground” shit called carders.cc. For those who don’t: Carders is a marketplace full of everything that is illegal and bad. Carding, fraud, drugs, weapons and tons of kiddies. They used to be only a small forum, but after we erased 1337-crew they got more power. The rats left the sinking ship. The voices told us to own them since carders is our fault and we had to fix our flaw. So we did.

                                <p>
                                    During the ownage they also gave us lulz by showing off their ridiculous configuration skills which had a specific impact on their security. They actually managed to chmod and chown nearly everything to 777 and www-user readable. Including their /root directory.

                                The database of correspondence includes messages between buyers and sellers on the forum as they exchanged stolen bank-card data and criminal services.

                                One message is from a vendor selling skimmers to attach to bank-card readers to sniff the card data. He’s also hawking login information to bank accounts in the United States and Britain that have a minimum $15,000 balance in them.

                                This isn’t the first time a carding forum has been owned by outsiders. Notorious hacker Max Vision, who ran the carding forum CardersMarket under the handle Iceman, <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/17-01/ff_max_butler">took over several competing carding forums</a> in 2006 through an ingenious hack, snagging their content and appropriating their members for his own carding empire.
