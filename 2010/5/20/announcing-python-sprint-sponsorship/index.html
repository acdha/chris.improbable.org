                            <p>
                                Otherwise known as “from psf import sprints”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Awhile ago, I started wondering if there was a way that the Python Software Foundation (the PSF) could reach out, and help encourage python development a little bit more than it currently does (it actually does a lot of stuff). I then spent a fair amount of time thinking about core contribution, and ways of getting people not just to become contributors to say, python-core, but also to the “ecosystem” of big-P-Python. It’s part of my job now that I volunteered to be on the PSF Board.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then, a few weeks ago, I asked the question – “<a href="http://jessenoller.com/2010/04/22/why-arent-you-contributing-to-python/">Why aren’t you contributing (to python)?</a>” – that post alone got my little blog here about 30,000 hits in around 48 hours. Pretty impressive for navel gazing (not even controversial navel gazing, at that). In the days following that post, I’ve had a lot of public and private discussions with people about various ways to help improve things, what could work, what wouldn’t work, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One thing has been stuck in my head – <strong>sprints</strong> – sprints are places where a bunch of programmers and hackers of all skill levels, sit in a room and work on a particular code domain, it could be a website, it could be python bugs, it could be a module, library, or anything, really. The point is getting a bunch of people together in a room, feed them, water them and enable the hacking.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And finally – there’s Python 3.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Python 3 is a bit of an interesting animal – and while it is the <a href="http://jessenoller.com/2009/10/25/dive-into-python-3-the-foreward/">future of the language</a>, and a much brighter one at that, the rate at which people are porting to Python 3 is a little slower than many of us would like. Porting libraries to Python 3 can be relatively simple, but it can also be boring, tedious and require mentorship and guidance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Given these itches of mine – I’ve decided to try to find (or at least, start the formulation) of a cure. A few weeks ago, I approached the rest of the Python Software Foundation board, and presented them with a “sponsored sprint” proposal. The short version being that the PSF would spin up a committee which would accept and evaluate sprint proposals from the world as a whole, and give each sprint a relatively set amount of money.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The sprints themselves are relatively focused – Python-core, the Python website, docs, bugs – and finally, porting Python 2 libraries to Python 3.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So – all of that said, I’m officially publicly announcing the new program. I’m still working on initial committee membership, and putting together things like the mailing list, but I will soon be announcing a call for applications. Below, you will find the full proposal – please feel free to post comments, or send me private email (jnoller at python dot org) about questions or concerns. If you want to help – please <strong>please</strong> contact me – I can not possibly make this a success on my own.
                            </p>

                                This proposal outlines a global “focused sprint” initiative for the Python community (including Python core). The initiative outlined in this proposal is designed to help raise both the profile of the PSF, while also encouraging community, Python 3 adoption, and possible python-core contributions. This proposal does not identify any sort of return on investment or profit for the foundation; nor does it attempt to identify metrics of success. The success of this proposal is determined by the social “buzz”, patches, new contributors, etc. We hope that this will naturally raise the awareness of the PSF, as well as bringing in an overall more diverse contributor group.
