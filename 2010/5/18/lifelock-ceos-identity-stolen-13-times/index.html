                                Apparently, when you publish your Social Security number prominently on your website and billboards, people take it as an invitation to steal your identity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                LifeLock CEO Todd Davis, whose number is displayed in the company’s ubiquitous advertisements, has by now learned that lesson. He’s been a <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2010-05-13/news/cracking-life-lock-even-after-a-12-million-penalty-for-deceptive-advertising-the-tempe-company-can-t-be-honest-about-its-identity-theft-protection-service/">victim of identity theft at least 13 times</a>, according to the <em>Phoenix New Times</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That’s 12 more times than has previously been known.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In June 2007, Threat Level reported that Davis had been the victim of identity theft after someone <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2007/06/lifelock_founde_1/">used his identity to obtain a $500 loan</a> from a check-cashing company. Davis discovered the crime only after the company called his wife’s cellphone to recover the unpaid debt.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                About four months after that story published, Davis’ identity was stolen again by someone in Albany, Georgia, who opened an AT&amp;T/Cingular wireless <a href="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2010/05/todd-davis-police-report.pdf">account using his Social Security number</a> (.pdf), according to a police report obtained by the <em>New Times</em>. The perpetrator racked up $2,390 in charges on the account, which remained unpaid. Davis, whose real name according to police reports is Richard Todd Davis, only learned a year later that his identity had been stolen again after AT&amp;T handed off the debt to a collection agency and a note appeared on his credit report.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then last year, Davis discovered seven more fraudulent accounts on his credit report that were opened with his personal information and have outstanding debt in the amount of $3,583, according to the police report.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Someone opened a Verizon account in New York, leaving an unpaid bill of at least $186. An account at Centerpoint Energy, a Texas utility, was delinquent $122. Credit One Bank was owed $573, and Swiss Colony, a gift-basket company, was seeking $312.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to these amounts, Davis’s credit report showed five collection agencies were seeking other sums from accounts opened in his name: Bay Area Credit was pursuing $265; Associated Credit Services was seeking two debts in the amount of $207 and $213; Enhanced Recovery Corporation was chasing $250 and $381.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A spokeswoman for the Albany police, who investigated the AT&amp;T/Cingular account but never made any arrest, told the <em>New Times</em> that Davis’ publication of his Social Security number created more victims than just himself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “It’s unfortunate he chose to conduct business in that way,” spokeswoman Phyllis Banks said. “It’s not fair to [AT&amp;T] because they’re losing a pretty substantial amount of money.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                LifeLock refused to discuss the issue with the <em>New Times</em>. The company did not respond to a request for comment from Threat Level.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The company was <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/lifelock-accused-of-running-con-operation/">fined $12 million in March</a> by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lifelock promised in ads that its $10 monthly service would protect consumers from identity theft. The company also offered a $1 million guarantee to compensate customers for losses incurred if they became a victim after signing up for the service. The FTC called the claims bogus and accused LifeLock of operating a scam.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “In truth, the protection they provided left such a large hole … that you could drive that truck through it,” said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to a LifeLock TV ad showing a truck painted with Davis’s Social Security number driving around city streets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Davis’ history as an identity-theft victim would seem to call into question the company’s ability to protect consumers from a similar fate.
