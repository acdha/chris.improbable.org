                            I finally caught up on my magazines over the weekend and generally agree with this assessment - Goldberg has a bad history but this article is more balanced and interesting than many initial responses would lead you to believe
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p style="clear:both">
                                Maybe I’m straying into #slatepitches territory, but the more I think about <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/1969/12/the-point-of-no-return/8186/">Jeffrey Goldberg’s Atlantic article</a> on the Israeli threat to commit an act of war against Iran, the better I think it is. <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/why-not-to-bomb-iran/?hp">Robert Wright’s rejoinder</a> can be read as making a similar argument to my own.
                            </p>
                            <p style="clear:both">
                                People complain because Goldberg serves in the article as a mouthpiece for the hawkish establishment of Israel, especially PM Netanyahu and his circle. He’s too close to them. He doesn’t present the critiques of Israel’s propaganda campaign forcefully enough. And, hey, yeah.
                            </p>
                            <p style="clear:both">
                                At the same time, in Goldberg’s article, all on its own, Israel’s policy-makers condemn themselves out of their own mouth. If all you had was “The Point of No Return” and a brain, you would have everything you need to judge Israel’s case for bombing Iran as unjustified and immoral. In fact, there are truths in Goldberg’s article that appear almost nowhere else in the USA’s establishment media:
                            </p>
                            <p style="clear:both">
                                * Netanyahu has no intention whatsoever of implementing a two-state solution – at best he might take steps in that direction once his revanchist Daddy is dead;<br>
                                * Netanyahu regrets the few partial steps he took under American pressure to comply with any smidgen of the spirit or letter of the Oslo agreements;<br>
                                * Hardly anybody important in the Israeli government really believes that Iran would use nuclear weapons if Iran in fact develop them;<br>
                                * Many don’t even worry that Iranian nukes would make it impossible for Israel to respond conventionally to Iranian “provocations” – rather, they want to go to war against a foreign country* for extremely speculative concerns about “brain drain” that are so time-dilated one suspects Iran might be deploying its nukes in near-orbit around <a href="http://blackholes.stardate.org/directory/factsheet.php?p=Cygnus-X-1">Cygnus X-1</a>;<br>
                                * And by the way, as a child of the MAD Era in 20th-Century history, I feel qualified to say, “Grow a pair, Senior Israeli Dudes.” Brain drain. <em>Sheesh</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p style="clear:both">
                                It adds up to a devastating case for <em>mens rea</em> regarding a prospective war crime. You don’t need to “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisking">fisk</a>” Goldberg’s article with links to other sources making the above points. <em>They are all in Goldberg’s article</em>. And probably only a reporter as friendly to the aims of the Israeli government could get its officials to speak so freely for an American audience. You can feel free to speculatively denigrate Goldberg’s motives for allowing so much frankness to seep through, but another thing we had in the MAD Era was the New Criticism. It’s the work that matters, not the author.
                            </p>
                            <p style="clear:both">
                                The article does not contain every possible and likely criticism of Israeli policy or the case for aggressive war against Iran*. (e.g. it’s by no means just Netanyahu’s Dad that opposes a two-state solution; Iran “needs” to be bombed because it’s Israel’s last remotely material regional rival; what would it really mean or matter that “the small Arab countries of the Gulf would have no choice but to leave the American orbit and ally themselves with Iran, out of self-protection?” If an Iranian nuke really threatens “a second holocaust” then is concentrating half the world’s Jewish population in <a href="http://www.iris.org.il/sizemaps/new_jersey.htm">a really sandy New Jersey</a> an effective survival strategy for the Jewish people? etc.) But even though the article doesn’t say everything, it still says what it says.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                * This footnote is for our American readers: Bombing a country <em>is</em> going to war with that country – not, as American discourse frequently has it, some kind of <em>alternative</em> to war. Nor is a Basset Hound an <em>alternative</em> to a dog. A Basset might be an alternative to a Newfie, as bombing is an alternative to invading with ground troops, scattering the survivors and annexing the conquered lands. But a bombing campaign is a war as a Basset Hound is a subtype of <em>canis lupus familiaris</em>.
