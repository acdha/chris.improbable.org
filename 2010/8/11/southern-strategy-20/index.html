They founded a Sufi organization advocating melding Islamic observance with women’s rights and modernity. After 9/11 they raised their profile, renaming the group the American Society for Muslim Advancement and focusing on connecting Muslims and wider American society. They spoke out against religious violence; the imam advised the F.B.I.; his wife joined the board of the 9/11 memorial and museum.

                                        The <em>Times</em> report however, descends into a kind of "liberal" media know-nothingism when it comes to how this became a controversy, suggesting that " a combination of arguable naïveté, public-relations missteps and a national political climate in which perhaps no preparation could have headed off controversy." This is a remarkable formula that manages to place the blame everywhere except where it belongs--on a right-wing smear machine that went into overdrive in an effort to portray Rauf and Khan as terrorist sympathizers, an experience no one outside of contemporary partisan politics could have possibly been prepared for. The conservative media lied about the location of the project, they <a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=the_war_over_the_war_on_terror"><font color="#800080">lied</font></a> about Rauf's background, they <a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/cityofbrass/2010/07/qa-with-sharif-el-gamal-about.html"><font color="#0066CC">lied</font></a> about the project's funding, they <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/adam_serwer_archive?month=08&amp;year=2010&amp;base_name=factual_misstatements"><font color="#0066CC">lied</font></a> about when the project would be built, and the <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/adam_serwer_archive?month=08&amp;year=2010&amp;base_name=nro_lies_about_imam_rauf"><font color="#0066CC">lied</font></a> about Rauf's political beliefs. And it would have been one thing if it had just been a small group of people lying, but they <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/201007200004"><font color="#0066CC">had</font></a> an entire cable news station to lie for them, and politicians who were willing to <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=38482"><font color="#0066CC">amplify</font></a> their smears. This controversy isn't about the "political climate." It's the fruit of a conscious, deliberate, and sustained effort. [...]

                                    <p>
                                        The reason this became a national controversy is because Republicans see a political advantage in harnessing anti-Muslim sentiment, particularly if that <a href="http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/29957/lazio-challenges-cuomo-to-mosque-only-debate/"><font color="#0066CC">forces</font></a> Democrats to defend an unpopular minority group. ...

                                    <p>
                                        So what we're left with is a largely uncontested notion that any observant Muslim is a potential national security threat, a view that was once confined to the conspiratorial right wing fringe right but is now, thanks to Republican demagoguery, Democratic cowardice, and mainstream media know-nothingism, an entirely respectable, mainstream view. This isn't just a setback for religious tolerance and individual freedom, it's a setback for the fight against terrorism, which demands that the United States marginalize violent extremists, not embrace their narrative and worldview.

                                    It is also worth emphasizing that the Cordoba group represents a strain of moderate, liberal Islam that many on the right claim that they want to hear more from in the battle of ideas with al-Qaeda's brand of extremism.
