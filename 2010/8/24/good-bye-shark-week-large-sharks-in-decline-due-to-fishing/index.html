                                Sharks have been honed into efficient predators by over 400 million years of evolution, but that didn’t prepare them for commercial-scale fishing. Sharks, skates, and rays are fantastically abundant in unexploited parts of the ocean, but a new review shows that even light fishing—both targeted at sharks and other species—can send populations into a tailspin. Large, top-predator shark species appear to suffer the most, and their dwindling numbers are drastically affecting many marine ecosystems.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The review, which appears in <em>Ecology Letters</em>, synthesizes dozens of research papers on sharks, skates, and rays to draw a picture of declining large shark populations. There has been a commensurate rise in what ecologists call mesopredators, like rays, small sharks, dolphins and turtles—animals one step down from apex predators. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fishing operations appear to be at fault. Targeted commercial fishing, by-catch, and even subsistence fishing are rearranging the chips in many marine ecosystems, knocking large sharks from their positions as top predators and sending waves throughout the rest of the food web.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These conclusions may be somewhat surprising given that many sharks are renowned generalists, able to feast on a wide variety of prey. As a group, sharks also have been fantastically adaptable. They inhabit nearly all marine waters—coastal, open ocean, even the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_shark">Arctic regions</a>—and occupy a variety of niches. Despite their success, however, sharks are limited by their reproductive strategies. They mature sexually later and produce fewer offspring than bony fish, making them more like marine mammals in that sense. This sort of life history makes them particularly susceptible to overfishing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                More than 90 percent of all elasmobranch species—the collective name for sharks, rays, and skates—live close to the ocean floor on continental shelves and slopes. This makes them especially vulnerable to trawling. Surveys in the Gulf of Mexico between 1972 and 2002 revealed steep population declines of shallow water species—up to 99 percent in one case—that turn up as shrimp by-catch.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When trawling begins in an area, the researchers note that elasmobranch species diversity is often high, but it falls off as the practice continues. Large sharks tend to disappear, followed by a population boom of smaller sharks, rays, and skates. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Little is known about how shifting shark populations alter marine food webs, but the paper cites a few examples of sharks’ widespread influence. In South Africa, a decline in large shark numbers caused a boom in smaller inshore shark populations, which in turn sent bony fish stocks plummeting. In another case off the North Carolina coast, cownose rays are consuming more bay scallop than they have in the past. The rays aren’t hungrier—there were simply more of them because fewer large sharks are holding their numbers in check.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Large shark populations still exist in some more remote areas of the oceans, especially in the Pacific, but global shark catches continue to rise. The researchers think a change in fishing practices is also afoot, with many sharks now being actively fished instead of caught accidentally. Part of the cause, they state, is the popularity of shark fin soup in Asia. Still, they point out, by-catch from regular fishing remains the largest threat to the sleek marine predators.
