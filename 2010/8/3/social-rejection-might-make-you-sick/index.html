                                Finally, someone is trying to find out why nerds stereotypically have asthma. A new experiment conducted at UCLA shows that social stress and rejection are related to the release of certain inflammatory chemicals in the body; these chemicals have been linked to several medical conditions, including asthma, arthritis, and some kinds of cancer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the study, a group of researchers recruited a bunch of students at UCLA and subjected them to socially stressful situations. The students were asked write a speech and then read it to a pair of evaluators, who then acted as if the speech were abhorrently subpar. After that, they had to perform mental arithmetic for a proctor who would appear impatient with them and urge them to go faster. A subset of the participants were also made to play a game of "Cyberball" with two other people, who were asked to socially exclude them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Throughout these socially stressful experiences, researchers took mouth swabs of the students and monitored their activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, a part of the brain known to process rejection-related distress. (It's possible that the swabbing added to the stress.) The two measures showed that greater activity in this area of the brain correlated with a rise in two inflammatory chemicals that are known to play a role in the onset or progress of conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, depression, and various types of cancer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The authors speculate that there may be some overlap in the neural circuits that process social and physical pain, resulting in a similar bodily response to both. The release of the inflammatory chemicals are typical of a basic threat response, as they help wounds heal more quickly and reduce the risk of infection.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The scientists didn't look into whether increases in social stress correlated with increased inflammation, or which symptom causes which—that is, if being a nerd begets asthma, or if asthma begets a nerd. Still, if the inflammatory results of social stress are cumulative, understanding the relationship better could help in controlling related health problems.
