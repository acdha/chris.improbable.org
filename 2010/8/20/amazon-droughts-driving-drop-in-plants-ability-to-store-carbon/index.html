                            <p>
                                Most of the focus of climate policy has been on efforts to cut down on the carbon we're dumping into the atmosphere, either by limiting emissions in the first place, or by capturing and storing it. But the Earth itself already does a lot of the latter for us: roughly 60 percent of the carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere gets taken up by the oceans and terrestrial ecosystems. That has led to worries that land use changes and rising temperatures themselves might start <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/11/have-we-started-to-fill-our-carbon-sinks.ars">inhibiting the natural carbon sinks</a>. A study published in yesterday's issue of <em>Science</em> provides some evidence that this may be taking place: droughts over the past decade have caused the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> taken up by land plants to drop.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The authors of the new paper focus on a figure called "net primary production," or NPP, which acts as a measure of the growth of terrestrial plant biomass. It's possible to estimate NPP using spectroscopic data obtained from satellites, and the authors use a 10-year record obtained from an instrument aboard NASA's <a href="http://terra.nasa.gov/">Terra mission</a>. Since plants grow by removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere, the changes in vegetation revealed by NPP should provide some measure of how effectively the planet's surface is sequestering carbon.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One of the surprises of the paper is just how well NPP acts as a measure. The first figure of the paper shows how annual changes in NPP compare to changes in the rate of growth in atmospheric carbon; the two graphs are eerily similar. When NPP goes up, the growth of atmospheric carbon goes down. This is more than a bit surprising, given that, overall, the oceans are a larger sink, and many of the carbon-fixing organisms there undergo boom-and-bust cycles that radically change their populations. The data here suggests that a lot of what happens in the ocean balances itself out, leaving very little year-to-year variability.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fires also correlate with changes in annual carbon fluxes, but the correlation is not as strong as NPP, and many of the fires that occur are the product of extended droughts that had already dropped the NPP, or occur during the process of human-driven deforestation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because the Terra instrument provides decent spatial resolution, the authors were able to ask which regions were contributing to changes in NPP. In keeping with the general trend of reforestation within the developed world, the Northern Hemisphere showed a slight increase in NPP over the past decade, driven primarily by productivity in North America and, to a lesser extent, Europe and Siberia.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, these changes were dwarfed by events in the Southern Hemisphere. Indonesia, Australia, and southern Africa all saw huge drops in NPP, as did Argentina and a large portion of the Amazon basin. In fact, the authors find that, to a large extent, trends in the Amazon drove the majority of changes in the past decade. "Amazon NPP alone explains 66 percent of the global NPP variations," they note, "though it accounts for only 14 percent of the global total."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The authors suggest a pretty plausible explanation for how rising temperatures could have driven these trends. The Terra instruments also provide information on snow cover, which averages 125 days in the Northern Hemisphere; that figure has been declining with rising temperatures. In contrast, land in the Southern Hemisphere only gets an average of 7.5 days of snow cover, suggesting rising temperatures would make little difference.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That doesn't, however, explain why NPP trended downwards in the Southern Hemisphere, so the authors examine trends in the water cycle. During the past decade, the Southern Hemisphere has actually seen increased levels of rainfall, but these have been offset by an increased evaporation rate driven by the high temperatures. As a result, the area has experienced an overall drying trend, which the authors conclude is the likely cause of the NPP decline.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The authors caution that a decade's worth of data is too short to separate long-term drying trends from some of the significant periodic droughts that occurred during the past 10 years, they suggest a few factors are likely to cause the recent trends to persist. For starters, the areas that saw improved NPP in the past decade account for only 16 percent of the global total, and less than a quarter of the total vegetated land area. They also cite a series of studies that indicate that increasing droughts are likely to accompany the increasing temperatures expected over the next several decades.
