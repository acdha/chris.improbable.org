                                    As with <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/a-terrible-ugliness-is-born/">Ireland's attempt</a> to tighten their belts out of a recession, so, too, does Greece suffer the <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,712511,00.html">fate of Hoovernomics</a>:
                                </p>

                                        The austerity measures that were supposed to fix Greece's problems are dragging down the country's economy. Stores are closing, tax revenues are falling and unemployment has hit an unbelievable 70 percent in some places. Frustrated workers are threatening to strike back.
                                    </p>

                                    Luckily, President Obama pushed for a stimulus instead of doing&nbsp;what most Republicans were calling for at the onset of the recession: imposing austerity measures at a time of sagging demand (also known as "what Herbert Hoover did to spur on the Great Depression").
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Unfortunately, Obama didn't push for a sufficiently large enough stimulus - as <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2010/07/not-just-math-plan.html">measured by his own financial advisors</a> applying the applicable formulas (at least, the competent ones, with the likes of Larry Summers badly miscalculating for no discernibly rational reason, and Rahm Emanuel applying a political lens to counsel for a lower number regardless of the math).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Further weakening the effort, a self-styled group of "moderates" in the Senate <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2009/02/nelson_collins_slash_education_funding_in_stimulus_while_touting_stimulus_boost_to_education/">pared back</a> the already-too-small stimulus package - cutting, of all things, aid to the States, which money was badly needed and is used, among other things,&nbsp;to keep teachers, firefighters and police officers on the job.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Speaking of the States, at a time when reduced tax revenue sent many budgets plunging into the red, and due to the mandates of State laws that require balanced budgets, States needed more, not less, aid from the federal government just to tread water - or, rather, not cut services and jobs too deeply.&nbsp; Due to the economic downturn, and absent&nbsp;a sufficient&nbsp;injection of aid from the Federal government, States cut back massively on spending, largely <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/06/the-no-stimulus-economy/">wiping out</a> the <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2010/06/stimulus-what-stimulus.html">stimulative</a> effect of the already-too-small stimulus.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Put simply, while there was an injection&nbsp;of stimulus from the Federal government, on the State level, there was a massive contraction, leaving only a slight net stimulus - certainly too small to counteract the considerable&nbsp;recessionary effects.&nbsp; So while the federal government was engaged in a Keynesian effort to gin up demand, there were, to paraphrase Atrios, <em>50 Little Hoovers</em> implementing austerity measures at precisely the worst time in terms of economic cycles.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On an international level, at the most recent G20 conference, world leaders were almost all doing <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/madmen-in-authority/">the <em>Hoover Shuffle</em></a> in calling for extreme austerity measures in response to a global economic slump, with Obama the lone voice of reason in terms of asserting the need to put off budgetary discipline until the world economy was on firmer footing such that the contraction would not pose a risk.&nbsp; He deserves credit for at least trying to talk Europe down from the ledge, not that his efforts were entirely successful, which doesn't bode well for the world economy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On a national level, the conundrum this country now faces is that we need another stimulus bill - one designed to make up for the initial deficiency in terms of dollar amount, as well as the austerity measures put into effect on the State level.&nbsp; Politically, though, that will be a very hard sell - with Republicans, now that they are out of power, attacking any and all spending measures as wasteful pork.&nbsp;&nbsp;Keynes be damned.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Which is what Paul Krugman was trying to call attention to at the time of the stimulus fight.&nbsp; While we might not be heading down the exact paths traveled by Greece and Ireland, we're not exactly going in the opposite direction either.
