                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                I’ve wanted to write this post for a while, and reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Metaphors-We-Live-George-Lakoff/dp/0226468011/">“Metaphors we live by”</a> has given me some language and ideas to express it in. So here goes.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Requirements come from above
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                In a straw-man Waterfall project, requirements are delivered to senior developers to design. Senior developers deliver the designs to junior developers to implement. Managers instruct teams in how to progress. We have, in our language and hierarchical organisation, a metaphor which maps “up” to the origin of the project, and “down” to the implementing details. We also think in terms of seniority and power, with the originators of the vision having that seniority and power, and the more junior developers and testers being at the bottom of the pile. We even talk about the team members “on the ground”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Think of every organisational chart with the managers at the top, or the V-model in which the requirements are split into increasing detail towards the bottom.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In life, things naturally flow downwards.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Orders come from above
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The other hierarchy with which we’re familiar is the military. We can map our employment and communication hierarchies to those of the military. We even talk about companies fighting for market share, defending their reputation, a hostile trading environment, captains of industry, command-and-control management, etc. It’s hardly surprising that we have, in our subconsciousness, another pattern: that the more junior members of a company should obey orders. (This isn’t necessarily true even in the military, but it fits our perception of it.)
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Turning the world upside-down
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                I once heard of a business analyst who got tired of explaining the requirements to the developers. “I’ve told you three times already!” she snapped. “Everything’s clear. Just do it.” The BA sees the developers as working to fulfil her requirements. They serve her needs, rather than the other way around.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When we write and deliver software to a user on an Agile project, we ask them for their feedback.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Is this useful to you?
                                </li>
                                <li>Is this easy to use?
                                </li>
                                <li>Is anything difficult to use?
                                </li>
                                <li>Does it help you to do your job more effectively?
                                </li>
                                <li>Can you think of any ways we could make this more intuitive?
                                </li>
                                <li>What would you like next?
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Because we think of communication in terms of orders, we also think of junior staff delivering value to senior staff. We don’t necessarily think in terms of the communication itself being a form of delivery. If we did, we might ask for feedback from the users of our communication.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Is this communication useful to you?
                                </li>
                                <li>How easy was our communication to use?
                                </li>
                                <li>Was anything difficult to understand?
                                </li>
                                <li>Did it help you to do your job more effectively?
                                </li>
                                <li>Can you think of any format you’d find more intuitive than this?
                                </li>
                                <li>Any questions?
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                If the BA above was a piece of software, her users would be filing bug reports, working around her, and using her competitors instead. I imagine instead that she’ll get a poor review and teams will prefer to work with her colleagues. If they only have the one BA to work with, the project will probably fail – the developers won’t be able to use her to get their job done.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Stakeholders aren’t users
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                I’ve <a href="http://lizkeogh.com/2010/02/02/theyre-not-user-stories/">written about this before</a>, and it takes on a new importance in the context of users, and stakeholders, of communication. When we get a management report, we often think, “So what?” We hit the delete key. Instead, we could try to think, “Who is it that cares about us understanding this? Why does he care?” It’s often the case that a user is meant to do something, as part of his job, which is for the benefit of someone else. Similarly, we may be asked to understand or act on something for someone else’s benefit – and it <em>won’t be the person delivering the message</em> either.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The stakeholders of communication on a project are often stakeholders of the project itself – the security expert, the chief architect, the facilities manager, etc.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Project experience
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://manicprogrammer.com/cs/blogs/willeke/default.aspx">Eric</a> gave me the concept of a “Project experience”. In the same way that we can think of communication as a form of delivery, we can think of the experience that our stakeholders and customers have when they ask us, as a project team, to deliver their code. We can ask usability questions about the team.
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                </li>
                                <li>Is it easy to see what’s going on and get information about the progress of the team?
                                </li>
                                <li>Is it easy to undo a mistake?
                                </li>
                                <li>Is it easy to input a new idea?
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                We often hold retrospectives amongst ourselves to work out how to change our processes. I’d also like to see us actively getting feedback from the people who use the project. And next time someone gives you some instructions which are unclear or don’t help you to do your job, perhaps this metaphor will help.
                            </p>
