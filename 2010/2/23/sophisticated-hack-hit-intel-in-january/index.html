                            <p>

                                Intel is the latest U.S. corporation to acknowledge that it was hacked in January in a sophisticated attack that occurred at the same time that Google, Adobe and others were targeted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The giant California-based chipmaker was rumored to have been among some 34 companies that were targeted, but said on Tuesday there was no evidence to tie its hack to the attack on Google and others.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “We did not see the kind of broad-based attack as described by Google,” said Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy. “Companies routinely see hackers trying to get into their system. It is a risk factor and that’s why it was in the 10-K. We’ve seen no loss of [intellectual property] as a result of any of these attacks.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In its <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50863/000095012310015237/f54119e10vk.htm">latest 10-K filing</a> to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Intel disclosed that it had been the target of a “sophisticated incident [that] occurred in January 2010 around the same time as the recently publicized security incident reported by Google.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The company did not indicate in its SEC filing what information was taken, if any, or who was behind the attack and couched the disclosure as just one of many regular attempts to invade its networks.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>

                                    We regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology systems by, for example, masquerading as authorized users or surreptitious introduction of software…. These attempts, which might be the result of industrial or other espionage, or actions by hackers seeking to harm the company, its products, or end users, are sometimes successful…. We seek to detect and investigate these security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft and/or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and reduce marketplace acceptance of our products.
                                </p>

                                Mulloy said the company mentioned the Google hack in its filing only because it had recently been in the news.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Google announced in January that it had been the target of a <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/google-censorship-china/">“highly sophisticated” and coordinated hack attack</a>, since dubbed Operation Aurora, against its network and against other companies in the defense, technology and finance industries. Google said the hackers had stolen intellectual property — presumed to be its source code — and sought access to the Gmail accounts of human rights activists. The attack originated from China, the company said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Shortly after Google’s announcement, Adobe revealed that it had also been targeted in the attack.

                                Computer security firm iDefense has said that <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/google-hack-attack/">34 companies were targeted by the attackers</a>, who were primarily after source code.
                            </p>

                                A recent report has provided details into the nature of the <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/02/apt-hacks/">persistent espionage attack on Google</a> that mirrored attacks on thousands of companies over the last few years, which have largely gone unpublicized.

                            <p>
                                Other U.S. companies said to be targeted in the Google wave of attacks included Yahoo, Symantec, Juniper Networks, Northrop Grumman and Dow Chemical, according to <em>The Washington Post</em>, which <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/13/AR2010011300359.html">cited unnamed congressional and industry sources</a>.
