                            <p>
                                For nearly all of the tools provided by Django, there are hooks provided to allow for incremental modification and extension. Very rarely do you ever need to rewrite a significant amount of functionality within Django, simply to change the behavior of a tool. For example, if you want change the way a form will look, you can change a widget from the default, create a custom field, or just use your own HTML. With each option, you can override a bit more functionality but still take advantage of everything else the forms library provides.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can visualize these incremental options as a curve. At one end you have a stock form which is simple to write but provides limited control. At the other end, you have a custom form class with static HTML which provides much more control but is more complicated to create. In the case of forms this is a pretty smooth curve since there are options to incrementally replace all of the functionality of the library.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before Django 1.2 the ORM had a similar curve with one exception — it had a bit of a cliff at the end. In particular, if you got to the point where you needed to just write a custom SQL query you needed to go completely outside the ORM. While this wasn't horrible, there was functionality which one would still want from the ORM which one had to now rebuild on their own. With Django 1.2, a <tt>Model.objects.raw()</tt> method has been added to address this problem and smooth out the ORM's curve.
                            </p>
                            <div>
                                <h1>
                                    The Old Way

                                <p>
                                    Before Django 1.2 if you needed to do a raw SQL query, you needed to do something like:
                                </p>
                                <div>

                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    Now this isn't horrible, but we have lost access to functionality in the ORM beyond the ability to generate SQL queries. In particular, we've lost the automatic transformation of the results of our query into model instances. There are ways we could replicate the lost functionality without too much work but we'd be reinventing the wheel.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div>

                                <p>
                                    In Django 1.2 to perform a raw SQL query, you can do something like:
                                </p>
                                <div>
                                    <pre>
<span>from</span> <span>library.models</span> <span>import</span> <span>Author</span>

<span>query</span> <span>=</span> <span>"SELECT * FROM library_author"</span>
<span>authors</span> <span>=</span> <span>Author</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>raw</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    The result here, <tt>authors</tt>, is a <tt>RawQuerySet</tt>. <tt>RawQuerySet</tt> is much like <tt>QuerySet</tt> in that it is an iterable object which returns a model instance from the result set with each iteration. It is not like a <tt>QuerySet</tt> in that it cannot be chained. Since the query isn't being built programatically anymore, chaining doesn't make sense.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Similar to a raw database cursor, we can provide a collection of parameters to the raw method and Django will safely quote/escape them.
                                </p>
                                <div>
                                    <pre>
<span>query</span> <span>=</span> <span>"SELECT * FROM library_author WHERE first_name = </span><span>%s</span><span>"</span>
<span>params</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>'bob'</span><span>,)</span>
<span>authors</span> <span>=</span> <span>Author</span><span>.</span><span>objects</span><span>.</span><span>raw</span><span>(</span><span>query</span><span>,</span> <span>params</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    So this is great! We're not reinventing the wheel, we're protected from SQL injection attacks, and we have the model instances we want.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div>

                                    Like most things in Django, the <tt>raw()</tt> method offers some additional functionality to help with corner cases or particularly complex queries:
                                </p>
                                <div>
                                    <h2>

                                    <p>
                                        <tt>Model.objects.raw()</tt> doesn't care what order fields are returned in by the query, all that matters is that the query field names match up to a field on the model.

                                        If a query returns any fields which do not exist in the model class, they are added as annotations to the model instances returned by the <tt>RawQueryset</tt>. This allows you to easily take advantage of operations or calculations which are more efficient to perform within the database.<a href="http://djangoadvent.com/feed/#id4"><sup>1</sup></a>

This is useful in cases where you may not be pulling data from the “real” table for the model or when you have very large tables.

                                    There are a few limitations placed on what <tt>raw()</tt> can do. The biggest of which is that <tt>raw()</tt> will only allow <tt>SELECT</tt> queries. If any other type of query is attempted via <tt>raw()</tt>, an <tt>InvalidQuery</tt> exception will be raised. This is done partially because it doesn't make sense to return model instances for anything other than <tt>SELECT</tt> queries but it is primarily done as a deterrent. Modifying data with raw SQL is very much something which should be an absolute last resort in Django. Accordingly we didn't want to encourage the practice by making it any easier to do so. If you really need to perform raw SQL queries which are not <tt>SELECT</tt> queries, you can still get a raw database cursor and go from here.
                                </p>

                                    There you have it. Now in Django 1.2, you can much more easily perform raw SQL queries when you need to. The curve has been smoothed. Official documentation for this new feature can be found on the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/sql/#topics-db-sql">raw SQL</a> page.<a href="http://djangoadvent.com/feed/#id6"><sup>3</sup></a>

                                                It's worth noting here that when the term "model fields" is used, it means the database field name that the Django ORM is expecting to exist in the database, not necessarily the name of the python attribute on the model class. If you've overridden a field name using <tt>db_column</tt>, the override name is what the <tt>raw()</tt> method will be expecting.
