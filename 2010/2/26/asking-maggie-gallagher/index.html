                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                I had an email exchange with<a href="http://www.nationformarriage.org/site/c.omL2KeN0LzH/b.3836955/k.BEC6/Home.htm">NOM</a> president Maggie Gallagher.  By now you’ve probably heard the following quote from Lauren Ashley, Miss Beverly Hills (trying to become Miss California and then Miss USA):
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    The Bible says that marriage is between a man and a woman. In Leviticus it says, “If man lies with mankind as he would lie with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death and their blood shall be upon them.”
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Best case:  She doesn’t realize she’s saying we should kill gays.  Worst case:  She wants to kill gays.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Either she’s either dumb as a box of tiaras or she’s utterly craven.  She’s also easy to dismiss  — I mean, the city of Beverly Hills says there is no such contest or title, exposing her as a fraud.  As so often happens, conservative Christian moralists violate their morality while moralizing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then we get this statement from <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/02/23/miss-beverly-hills-lauren-ashley-same-sex-marriage-carrie-prejean/">Maggie Gallagher</a>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    I’m not surprised that Miss Beverly Hills, Lauren Ashley, opposes gay marriage — after all 45 percent of young Californians voted for Prop 8, as did 7 million Californians generally.  <strong>But I have to say, I am impressed with her courage in coming forward and for speaking up for Carrie.</strong> The elected officials of city of Beverly Hills are not demonstrating tolerance or kindness by continuing the avalanche of hatred against supporters of Prop 8.  [emphasis added]
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Some interpret this as a total endorsement of Lauren’s statement.  I try to be factual here, so I did the obvious thing.  I wrote to Maggie.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    I recently read your comments about Miss Beverly Hills on the Fox news website:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    [And here I inserted the quote directly above.]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I feel certain that this cannot be your entire quote, since you’re responding to Lauren Ashley’s statement that gays shall surely be put to death.  Could you please let me know the full version of your quote, so that we can all be clear on where you stand on the “surely be put to death” portion?  Thanks.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                And Maggie wrote back.  Here’s her full response:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    No i’m not.  Maggie
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                What?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was so confused, I first thought she was telling me she’s not Maggie.  Then perhaps:  <em>No, I’m not going to let you know the full quote</em>.  Finally, giving her the benefit of the doubt, maybe:  <em>No, I’m not a supporter of Lauren’s “surely be put to death” stance</em>.  Of course, it’s a dangerous thing, giving Maggie the benefit of the doubt.  So I asked her to clarify.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Maggie, thanks for the quick response.  But I don’t know what you  meant by “No I’m not.”  Did you say anything about Lauren Ashley’s “surely be put to death” comment that Fox left out?  Or have you issued comment elsewhere?  I haven’t been able to find anything and would really appreciate knowing.  Thanks.
                                </p>

                                No response so far.  I’ll update this if I get any.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But let’s give her that benefit of the doubt and assume she doesn’t want gays put to death.  It’s still scary portrait, in miniature, of her mental landscape:  Maggie hears a mini-sub-almost-not-celebrity advocating death for gays…and her only response is to praise the speaker for taking a stand against hate.
                            </p>
