                                    Very quotable Dahlia Lithwick on our collective <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2243429/">terrorist derangement syndrome</a>, and its corrosive effects on the rule of law:

                                        Moreover, each time Republicans go to their terrorism crazy-place, they go just a little bit farther than they did the last time, so that things that made us feel safe last year make us feel vulnerable today.

                                        Policies and practices that were perfectly acceptable just after 9/11, or when deployed by the Bush administration, are now decried as dangerous and reckless. The same prominent Republicans who <a href="http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/11/18/2130565.aspx">once celebrated</a> open civilian trials for Zacarias Moussaoui and Richard Reid, the so-called "shoe bomber," now claim that open <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/18/sessions-giuliani-backed_n_362479.html">civilian trials endanger Americans</a> (some Republicans have now even gone so far as to try to <a href="http://correspondents.theatlantic.com/andrew_cohen/2010/02/menlike_sen_lindsey_graham_r-sc.php">defund such trials</a>). Republicans who once supported closing Guantanamo are now <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/joan_walsh/politics/2010/02/02/republicans_play_politics_with_national_security/">fighting to keep it open</a>. And one GOP senator, who like all members of Congress must take an oath to uphold the Constitution, has voiced his concern that the Christmas bomber really needed to be "<a href="http://washingtonindependent.com/74331/sessions-to-mueller-why-didnt-we-torture-abdulmutallab">properly interrogated</a>" instead of being allowed to ask for a lawyer.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In short, what was once tough on terror is now soft on terror. And each time the Republicans move their own crazy-place goal posts, the Obama administration moves <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-trial3-2010feb03,0,688823.story">right along with them</a>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        It's hard to explain why this keeps happening. There hasn't been a successful terror attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. The terrorists who were tried in criminal proceedings since 9/11 are rotting in jail. The Christmas Day terror attack was both amateurish and unsuccessful. The Christmas bomber is <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704022804575042000390632726.html">evidently cooperating with intelligence officials</a> without the need to resort to thumbscrews. In a rational universe, one might conclude that all this is actually good news. But in the Republican crazy-place, there is no good news. There's <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/02/03/kt-mcfarland-christmas-day-bomber-cooperating-al-qaeda/">only good luck</a>. Tick tock. And the longer they are lucky, the more terrified Americans have become.

                                        This week <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/01/31/nostalgia/index.html">Glenn Greenwald</a> summarized how far the goal posts of normal have moved when he pointed out that "merely advocating what Ronald Reagan explicitly adopted as his policy—'to use democracy's most potent tool, the rule of law against' terrorists—is now the exclusive province of civil liberties extremists." Upon being elected to the U. S. Senate last month, Scott Brown declared: "Our Constitution and laws exist to protect this nation—they do not grant rights and privileges to enemies in wartime. In dealing with terrorists, our tax dollars should pay for weapons to stop them, not lawyers to defend them." As Adam Serwer <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=01&amp;year=2010&amp;base_name=new_rights"><font color="#810081">observed</font></a>, "This is the new normal for Republicans: You can be denied rights not through due process of law but merely based on the nature of the crime you are suspected of committing. Brown's rhetorical framing, that jettisoning the legal system we've had for 200-plus years represents 'tradition' while granting suspected criminals the right to legal counsel represents liberalism gone mad is new, and I suspect we'll hear it again." [...]

                                        Some of the very worst excesses of the Bush years can be laid squarely at the doorstep of a fictional construct: The "<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2003/LAW/03/03/cnna.Dershowitz/">ticking time bomb</a> scenario." Within minutes, any debate about terrorists and the law arrives at the question of what we'd be willing to do to a terrorist if we thought he had knowledge of an imminent terror plot that would kill hundreds of innocent citizens...But here's the paradox: It's not a terrorist's time bomb that's ticking. It's us. Since 9/11, we have become ever more willing to suspend basic protections and more contemptuous of American traditions and institutions. The failed Christmas bombing and its political aftermath have revealed that the terrorists have changed very little in the eight-plus years since the World Trade Center fell. What's changing—what's slowly ticking its way down to zero—is our own certainty that we can never be safe enough and our own confidence in the rule of law.

                                    It's amazing how much power we've ceded to Osama bin Laden, and how we let al-Qaeda and its pathetic offshoots completely warp our foundational principles of justice and the rule of law.  What's more amazing is that the people that are in the biggest hurry to grant Osama the most power over reshaping our society are the ones who claim the mantle of being "tough" on terror.
