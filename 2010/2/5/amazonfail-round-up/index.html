                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                In my <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/02/amazon-surrenders.html">most recent posting on this topic</a> I noted "Amazon surrender", and cited a New York Times article as saying that Amazon had agreed to re-list the Macmillan titles they'd dropped.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As of this morning, five days later, my own Tor books are still not available from Amazon. I'm hearing lots of reports from other Tor authors, too.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Amazon lied.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They lied about other things, too; in their press release they lied like a rug about Macmillan's negotiating position, mischaracterising it in the worst possible light from the point of view of onlookers. They lied by falsely positioning themselves as the defenders of cheap $9.99 ebooks and Macmillan as some kind of capitalist oppressor; the truth is that many ebooks sold via Kindle cost well over $9.99, while Macmillan were proposing to sell some titles for under $6.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Amazon lie by omission. They lie like politicians in an election campaign. And you've got to ask, if they're selling such a good product, and if they're such good-hearted folks, <em>why do they need to lie?</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'd like to note in passing that Amazon has a long history of bullying — from union-busting among its employees, <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/retailing/article5337770.ece">abusive treatment employees</a> (arguably in violation of health and safety standards in the UK), to punishing authors by de-listing their books as a way of applying negotiating pressure to publishers; <a href="http://www.thebookseller.com/news/59533-hachette-clashes-with-amazon.html">they did this to Hachette in May 2008</a>, and the people who got hurt the worst were the authors and their readers. In fact, Amazon are <a href="http://wakeupwalmart.com/facts/">the WalMart of the book trade</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, things have been moving rapidly this week:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/agents/breaking_hachette_book_group_to_transition_to_agency_model_151128.asp">Hachette are switching to the agency model, too</a> — which means Amazon will be fighting a war on two fronts next week. (Are they going to de-list close to a third of all the books they sell before this is over?)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20100202/news-corp-beats-earnings-revenue-estimates/">HarperCollins are also queueing up to renegotiate terms with Amazon</a>. That's the publishing arm of NewsCorp, who I am not terribly keen on — the third of the big six publishing groups. (What does it say about a retailer that half its suppliers are <em>really</em> unhappy with the terms it has imposed on them separately?)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Macmillan's CEO had this to say about Amazon, in <a href="http://www.publishersmarketplace.com/lunch/free/">a public letter to his authors and their agents</a>: "A word about Amazon. This has been a very difficult time. Many of you are wondering what has taken so long for Amazon and Macmillan to reach a conclusion. I want to assure you that Amazon has been working very, very hard and always in good faith to find a way forward with us. Though we do not always agree, I remain full of admiration and respect for them. Both of us look forward to being back in business as usual." (I don't think I'd have been that polite.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There's a lot more stuff going on behind the scenes. In particular, it looks like the industry-wide shift to the agency model, catalysed by Apple, has finally cracked open the door to a <a href="http://www.authorsguild.org/advocacy/articles/macmillan-e-royalties-at.html">renegotiation of royalty rates</a> payable by publishers to authors for ebooks. The traditional 10% royalty rate on hardcovers didn't come out of nowhere — it reflected a 50/50 split in the profits (the other 80% of the cover price going on production, printing, and distribution). With much lower printing and distribution costs, it looks like royalty rates of 25% or 30%, <em>on a much lower overall price</em>, may be where things are going under the new model. (Hint: this isn't finalized yet, which is why Macmillan aren't promising readers the moon on a stick — unlike Amazon.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Finally</b>, let's look at the authors, because we're the small mammals who get steamrollered when the dinosaurs start stomping on each other.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Novelist Cat Valente explains <a href="http://yuki-onna.livejournal.com/563086.html">lays out why she sides with her publisher</a>: "the costs of publishing an ebook are not zero. That is, if you have any interest at all in a quality product. No one goes around suggesting that everyone should become their own autonomous cheesemakers and cheering the death of the cheese industry. Why? Because that would result in <em>a lot of shitty cheese</em>."

                                And finally, I commend to you this blog posting by <a href="http://www.blakecharlton.com/2010/02/what-happens-to-a-debut-author%E2%80%99s-brain-on-amazonfail/">a guy whose first novel came out from Tor the very week Amazon decided to delist all Tor's books</a>. Talk about depressing ways to start (and quite possibly finish) a career.

                                The rumble is on-going, but on Monday I'm flying out to Boston and New York for about ten days. This means that your questions here are likely to go unanswered and I won't be posting for a week or so ... but I have a <b>surprise</b> waiting for you on Monday!
