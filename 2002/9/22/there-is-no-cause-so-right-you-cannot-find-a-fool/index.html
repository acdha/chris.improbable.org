                        Laura Crane provides <a href="http://lauracrane.blogspot.com/2002_09_15_lauracrane_archive.html">some much-needed criticism</a> of the modern environmental movement:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote class="cite">
                        Ive written before about my frustration with the consistently dire predictions from environmental groups. Time and time again, it seems to me that environmental groups believe they need to scare people into supporting their initiatives and their initiatives are a jumble of real and perceived environmental problems. Instead, I wish that these groups would do something useful like provide an objective analysis, based on science, to help people focus their efforts on those environmental issues that truly should be of concern. Explain science, explain the uncertainties, dont distort and automatically describe the world as seen through your worst-possible-case colored glasses, and most importantly dont act like this world would be better off without people. As humans, a world without human life means nothing to us.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        One thing that greatly disappointed me about the various responses to <a href="http://lomborg.org">The Skeptical Environmentalist</a> was the way criticism was dominated by personal attacks and pointless nit-picking. Left unaddressed were the larger issues - consistent exageration, misused science and the shift from a scientific focus to a quasi-religious "technology is evil" position where anything is justified as long as it smites the sinner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stephen Schneider made a telling comment which demonstrates a key change in tactics: <cite>"Wed like to see the world a better place, which in this context translates into our working to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climate change. To do that we need to get some broad based support, to capture the publics imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have."</cite> Spinning science to support a predefined position was temporarily effective at the expense of considerable long-term credibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The various apologists for gross polluters haven't threatened the environmental movement as effectively as these self-appointed guardians of environmental morality. When old-guard defenders are being <a href="http://www.lomborg.com/files/LindzenSciAmerLomborg.pdf">sharply</a> <a href="http://www.lomborg.com/files/Danish%20scientists%20reply%20to%20Scientific%20American.pdf">criticized</a> for misrepresenting <cite>both the book he is attacking and the science that he is allegedly representing</cite>, it should be an urgent wake-up call for the entire movement. No matter how good the intentions were, their result may be a devastating setback - consider how difficult it will be to get public support for future actions when most voters know they've been lied to repeatedly for many years.
