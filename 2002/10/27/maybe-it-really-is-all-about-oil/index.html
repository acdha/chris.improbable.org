                        The countries most strongly opposing "regime change" against the Iraqi government stand to lose the a great deal if Hussein is ousted since a new government would not bound by the current contracts. Unfortunately there seems to be something of a shortage of protest about the way inaction can be so profitable for anyone with a negotiable sense of moral outrage.

                        Over the last several years, Mr. Hussein has signed memorandums of understanding with oil companies to develop fields once sanctions are lifted. With the United States and Britain most sharply at odds with Mr. Hussein, American companies and BP did not participate in the process. Mr. Hussein himself favored companies from France, Russia and China in an effort, Mr. Sieminski said, to win friends in the United Nations Security Council.

                        One day after President Bush's demand that Iraq comply with United Nations arms control resolutions, three French parliamentary deputies flew to Iraq on what they described as a personal visit to urge Baghdad to comply with the demands.
                        <p>
                            The visit set off a political storm in France, where much is riding on the outcome of the diplomatic struggle over Iraq. While a humanitarian gesture, the trip also illustrated in part how countries are positioning themselves for an end of trade penalties. One of the three legislators, Thierry Mariani, 44, of President Jacques Chirac's Union for a Presidential Majority, told French television that the purpose of the trip was to urge Iraqi compliance with the United Nations' demands. But he was also quoted in Le Monde as justifying the trip with "the defense of French economic interests in Iraq."

                        Baghdad owes Moscow $8 billion in debt incurred before the Gulf War, and has used trade under the oil-for-food program to curry Moscow's favor, dangling oil investment deals to be signed after penalties were lifted.

                        What the Iraqi people would like to hang on their walls would be banners saying, `Yes, yes, Mr. Bush. Yes, yes, America.' There are 22 million Iraqis, and every one of them has 100 stories to tell of their suffering under Saddam.
