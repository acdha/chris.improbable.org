                        From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/09/international/middleeast/09FPRO.html">New York Times</a>:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote class="cite">
                        <p>
                            AMSTERDAM Ayaan Hirsi Ali had done well in the 10 years since she arrived in the Netherlands as a young refugee from Somalia and, until a few months ago, she lived a quiet life in her adopted land. Never did she intend to create a national commotion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She studied Dutch, took on cleaning jobs, went to university and worked as a political scientist. She made a name for herself pressing for the emancipation of Muslim women and documenting how thousands, living even here, were subjected to beatings, incest and emotional and sexual abuse.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To the surprise of many, she became a leading voice condemning the government's support for multiculturalism, programs costing millions of dollars a year that she considers misplaced because they help keep Muslim women isolated from Dutch society.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then Ms. Hirsi Ali, 32, began receiving hate mail, anonymous messages calling her a traitor to Islam and a slut. On several Web sites, other Muslims said she deserved to be knifed and shot. Explicit death threats by telephone soon followed. The police told her to change homes and the mayor of Amsterdam sent bodyguards. She tried living in hiding. Finally, last month, she became a refugee again, fleeing the Netherlands.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "I had to speak up," she said, in a telephone interview from her hiding place, "because most spokesmen for Muslims are men and they deny or belittle the enormous problems of Muslim women locked up in their Dutch homes."
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        It's interesting to see how the New York Times is quietly reversing its earlier position on this issue - half a year ago the NYT was an enthusiastic part of <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2002/05/08/fortuyn/index.html">the know-nothing mob attempting to smear Pim Fortuyn</a> by claiming that his concerns the intolerant views many immigrants had about gays and women's rights were part of a dangerous new outbreak of fascism. Someone must have realized that the handy "NYT Guide to Stereotyping" doesn't allow the "Extreme Right-Wing Bigot" smear to be used against a brown woman and so this time around they actually looked at the evidence and took a reasonable position.
