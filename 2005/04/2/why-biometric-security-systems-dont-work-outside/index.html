                    </p>
                    <blockquote cite="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4396831.stm">
                        Police in Malaysia are hunting for members of a violent gang who chopped off a car owner's finger to get round the vehicle's hi-tech security system.<br>
                        The car, a Mercedes S-class, was protected by a fingerprint recognition system.<br>
                        Accountant K Kumaran's ordeal began when he was run down by four men in a small car as he was about to get into his Mercedes in a Kuala Lumpur suburb.<br>
                        The gang, armed with long machetes, demanded the keys to his car.<br>

                    <p>
                        This is an interesting example of why biometric security systems will not make us meaningfully more secure: the arms race between car thieves and security system designers pushed the thieves into a more violent crime, significantly increasing the cost of the crime for the vehicle's owner, and he's now faced with an interesting problem - unlike most other security systems in common use biometric systems don't have any way for you to get a replacement ID if your current one is compromised or stolen. If Mr. Kumaran's car had been designed with true security in mind rather than marketing flash he'd simply be looking at replacing an identification token - the work of a skilled technician, not a emergency-room surgeon.

                        These systems are also going to make identity theft even hard to recover from because they fail in such a catastrophic fashion: currently victims of identity theft can take measures such as changing passwords, account numbers and getting a new Social Security number; with a fingerprint or retinal scan your identity is permanently compromised for everything which uses the same identification system. It's not even a question of changing the equivalent of a hash function which is used to identify a user - the same criminal rings which are currently setting up fake / trojan ATMs could easily modify their systems to not only record biometric ID functions but even to record the raw scan data, allowing them to generate new "fingerprints" as new identification schemes are introduced.
