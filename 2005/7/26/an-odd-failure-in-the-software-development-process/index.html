                        <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/alvaro?entry=why_i_do_think_opensolaris">Why I do think OpenSolaris ought to work with Debian</a> (via <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/07/21/Debian-Solaris">ongoing</a>) really resonated because I've been wasting time this morning trying out Solaris 10.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The install process is a bit more painful than Debian Sarge (and it was a lot harder to get the install media than Sun's claims of Solaris 10 being free would imply) but it wasn't that bad and after about an hour I had a V20z with 8GB of Solaris 10 &amp; free software. This being 2005 the first thing I tried to do was look for security updates, which is where the disillusionment started to set in:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Download and install updateConnection
                        </li>
                        <li>Attempt to login with my existing account - this appears to work and I'm presented with a list of updates.
                        </li>
                        <li>I check all of the install boxes (How hard can an "Install every security update" button be? Microsoft has this down...) and click "Install Now". Everything fails: "One or more of the updates specified do not have entitlement permissions". Huh? Isn't the CTO telling everyone that <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan?anchor=competing_against_a_social_movement">Solaris 10 is free and easier to maintain than Linux</a>?
                        </li>
                        <li>Check Sun website to learn that <q src="http://www.sun.com/service/sunupdate/">Sun Update Manager is available at no charge, and gives you access to Solaris 10 security updates and device drivers</q>.
                        </li>
                        <li>Check Sun website for details about free entitlement. Nothing...
                        </li>
                        <li>Check Sun FAQ. Lots of talk about how it's free, no details...
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        It was somewhere around that point that I gave up and decided that Solaris may be worth a look when Sun can add enterprise-class management to it. I'm sorry if that sounds like flamebait but I have a large stack of brand new Sun V20z servers which are all going to be running Debian in no small part because it will be up and ready in 20 minutes with almost all of the software we need in a maintainable form with scheduled regular updates for everything Debian provides, as well as various opensource projects and our internal packages, all with a single system using reliable, open tools and protocols.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't know why this is the case but it's the same problem which led us to dump Red Hat and SuSE as well - when it comes to installing, configuring and updating software the commercial Unixes are <b>well</b> behind Debian on usability, scalability, manageability and comically far behind on the range of available software (having updates for the core OS is nice but it's annoying when you have to buy or build another package management tool to handle everything else). We were perfectly willing to pay for Red Hat's service subscriptions (in fact we threw out a ton of entitlements which came with various Dell boxes) but the simple fact is that they offer less value than Debian at a significant increase in both cost and sysadmin time. When Red Hat chose to orphan all of their existing customers with no migration path to the "Enterprise" offerings we switched to Debian, a decision which has paid off many times since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's a bit surprising that the commercial offerings make far less business sense than the completely free alternative and it seems like a major market failure: there's constant pressure on customers to reduce overhead, better management options are increasingly important as the time to exploit security problems drops and the number of machines increases, and perhaps most importantly it's the sort of non-sexy problem which typically requires that you to pay people to care about. Perhaps the answer is simply that the third-party deployment/management tool market is well-established enough that people simply don't expect the operating system to come with a usable software deployment system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (Maybe Jonathan should <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20050605">make a more serious effort to partner with Apple</a> - Solaris 10 definitely has a better kernel than darwin but it's painfully obvious that Sun needs an Apple-level focus on the user-experience.)
