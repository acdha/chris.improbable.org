                        I noticed <a href="http://smuglispweeny.blogspot.com/">Kenny Tilton's</a> recent <a href="http://smuglispweeny.blogspot.com/2008/03/tiltons-law-solve-first-problem.html">Solve the First Problem</a> post on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/programming/info/6bo6w/comments/">reddit</a> a few days ago. It's a really simple rule: when faced with a complicated problem, start with the first thing you can fix — the others often turn out to be side-effects. This is one of my favorite "debugging magic" techniques - over the years I've run into many problems which seemed far more intimidating than they actually were because the bug spewed out hundreds of errors or the assumption that the bug must be a mistake on their part because the program in question must be far too widely used to have a bug like that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today I fixed a problem which has been annoying us for awhile using what I think of as the zero-th law of debugging: <em>if you can't find the problem, your first bug is poor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability">observability</a></em>.

                        <em>A little background: we've been working on a more scalable upgrade to our LDAP server infrastructure. Since we're a Debian shop the process was really simple: clone our base Debian VM, apt-get install slapd, run cfengine, a quick slapcat/slapadd and we're up and running 15 minutes later with an LDAP master &amp; a couple slaves (have I mentioned lately how much I love having invested in automation)? A little load-testing later and I'm ready to unleash this thing on our internal group — and then the guy down the hall mentions that he can't login…</em>

                    <p>
                        <em>After a quick look, this is even more confusing - the problem appears to be account specific but the LDAP records are very similar and copied from the current production server. Exhaustive comparisons between the two accounts turn up nothing. Soon one of the other admins discovers another interesting wrinkle: the problem only happens if pam_ldap uses SSL or STARTTLS - insecure connections work correctly for all accounts! Contributing to the confusion are the error messages insinuating that the problem is the LDAP server:</em>

                        <em>After about the fifth time comparing strace results the real problem dawns on me: the main thing making this hard is because pam_ldap and OpenLDAP have pretty rough debugging code which is really only used by the developers and so we're stuck guessing at what might be happening. This has been an inconvenience for years and I realized that I've spent more time scrutinizing high debug-level dumps and strace output than it would take to add proper logging to pam_ldap - and anyway, how many times can you not fix a mocking "error=Success" telling you that something clobbered a useful errno before you could see it?</em>

                    <p>
                        <em>A quick <code>apt-get source libpam-ldap</code> later and I had a huge pile of innovatively-indented code to slog through (thank FSM for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/indent/">indent</a>). The general process was to find each function in pam_ldap.c and add syslog() at each point where an error can cause an early return. I also cleaned up a number of the error messages and made sure that the important ones included the actual error codes since it was frequently the case that a meaningful low-level error was turned into an uninformative <code>return -1</code> before it was logged.

A quick check confirms that the problem is size related - both of the failing accounts have jpegPhoto attributes which are larger than the jpegPhotos for the working accounts. A quick test later and we've confirmed that size is the problem by telling <code>ldap_search_s()</code> to return only attribute names and not the values:</em>

This class of problems has been widely discussed in the <a href="http://loganalysis.org/">log-analysis</a> community and something which most sysadmins (myself included) tend to view as more intractable than they really are.
