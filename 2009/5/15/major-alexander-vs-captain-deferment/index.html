                                </p>

                                    <a href="http://www.vetvoice.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=2767">Matthew Alexander</a> from VetVoice highlights an important aspect of the torture debate (what a disappointment it is to write that phrase): even if torture works in terms of ferreting out certain information (which it doesn't), there are very real costs associated with employing it as official policy:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        Former VP Dick Cheney has requested the release of additional memos showing that torture and abuse saved American lives by preventing terrorist attacks.  If the Obama Administration decides to release these memos, then I suggest they also release statistics from Iraq showing the number of foreign fighters that were recruited because of our policy of torture and abuse.  It was tracked.  I know because I saw the slides and because I heard captured foreign fighters state this day in and day out.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The government can also release the statistics that show that 90% of suicide bombers in Iraq were these same foreign fighters.  These foreign fighters killed hundreds, if not thousands, of American soldiers [<em>ed note: and Iraqis who we were, ostensibly, trying to liberate and protect</em>].   
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After these revelations, Americans can judge whether or not a policy of torture and abuse kept us safe.  Unfortunately, we'll never be able to evaluate the damage that was done to past or future interrogations.  As I experienced firsthand, detainees were less likely to cooperate when they viewed us as hypocrites.  We can't establish the trust that is required to convince a detainee to cooperate unless we live up to the principles that we preach.   
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I had one detainee in Iraq, a previous Al Qaida fighter, who provided me with all the information he knew willingly without me having to run an interrogation approach.  He told me that Al Qaida had accused him of being a mole and tortured him before we rescued him.  He then proceeded to say that the reason he was going to cooperate was because we didn't torture him and because of that, he knew everything that he'd been told about us by Al Qaida was wrong. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Before 9/11, the protection of American soldiers from terrorist attacks was a priority for our country. Consider our responses to the Beirut Bombing, Khobar Towers, and the USS Cole. When we talk about keeping Americans safe from terrorist attacks, we need to include all Americans, especially those that serve in uniform.

                                    <em>Matthew Alexander spent fourteen years in the U.S. Air Force and Air Force Reserves. An “investigator turned interrogator” who deployed to Iraq in 2006, he conducted more than 300 interrogations and supervised more than 1,000. Alexander was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for his achievements in leading the the team that located Abu Musab alZarqawi, the leader of Al Qaida in Iraq, who was killed by Coalition Forces. He is the author of</em> How to Break a Terrorist: The U.S.Interrogators Who Used Brains, Not Brutality, to Take Down the Deadliest Man in Iraq<em>.</em>
