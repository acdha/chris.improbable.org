                            Ed Felten <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/breathalyzer-source-code-secrecy-endangers-minnesota-drunk-driving-convictions">posts</a> about the Minnesota Breathlyzer case (I've written about it <a href="http://www.educatedguesswork.org/2009/05/breathalyzers_and_source_code.html">here</a>):
                            <blockquote>
                                The problem is illustrated nicely by a contradiction in the arguments that CMI and the state are making. On the one hand, they argue that the machine's source code contains valuable trade secrets -- I'll call them the "secret sauce" -- and that CMI's business would be substantially harmed if its competitors learned about the secret sauce. On the other hand, they argue that there is no need to examine the source code because it operates straightforwardly, just reading values from some sensors and doing simple calculations to derive a blood alcohol estimate.
                                <p>
                                    It's hard to see how both arguments can be correct. If the software contains secret sauce, then by definition it has aspects that are neither obvious nor straightforward, and those aspects are important for the software's operation. In other words, the secret sauce -- whatever it is -- must relevant to the defendants' claims.
                                </p>

                                I'm not sure this argument is right in the general case. Ignoring the specific case of breathalyzers, if I want to develop a new piece of software, it's pretty helpful to have a worked example to rip off. To take a simple case, if I wanted to build a new NAT (a pretty well-understood technology) I'd rather start with some existing package than build everything myself. It's not that there is anything secret in one of these gizmos, just that it would give you something to imitate/test against, etc. This would be especially true if I could actually copy the source, not just mimic it. Conversely, if I were the vendor of an existing system, I wouldn't necessarily want to assist my competitors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Three further observations: First, I expect it's a lot less of an advantage to have the source code for a device like a breathalyzer or a voting machine. First, it's not a generic PC wired to a bunch of network ports: there's a bunch of sensors and stuff that can't be sourced from your average OEM network gear manufacturing plant (this is more true for breathalyzers than voting machines). Second, a lot of the business of selling something like this is engaging with law enforcement, voting officials, etc. There's more too it than just getting your boxes on the shelf at Fry's. Consequently, it's probably not as much of a competitive advantage to save on engineering costs as it might be in some other business.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Second, if every breathalyzer vendor is required to disclose their source code, it makes it a fair bit harder for your competitors to just steal your source code, since, at least potentially, you can see their source code and have an opportunity to demonstrate that it's a copy of yours. Of course, this doesn't rule out less blatant copying, using the original system as a template/regression test system, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Third, we're kind of stretching the definition of "trade secret" here, at some abstract level. As Ed observes, if the system is straighforward, what's the secret? On the other hand, it's fairly consistent with the relatively expansive tech industry definition of trade secret.
                            </p>
