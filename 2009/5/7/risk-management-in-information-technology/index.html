                                A Response to the Article “Why Silent Updates Boost Security”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                http://www.techzoom.net/publications/silent-updates/ by Thomas Duebendorfer, and Stefan Frei
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “We recommend any software vendor to seriously consider deploying silent updates as this benefits both the vendor and the user, especially for widely used attack-exposed applications like Web browsers and browser plug-ins”(Duebendorfer &amp; Frei, 2009)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the world of security we often seem to have two groups of thought, those that focus on risk management and those who focus on technical solutions. These two groups fight like cats and dogs, but both are necessary in order to have a more secure system. Articles like “Why Silent Updates Boost Security” fall under the technical-only mindset(dogs, because they are always dogging people to update stuff) as the idea that a vendor should silently push updates to their software. I have a more risk management mindset(panther, well its a type of cat) because I believe this does not work in an enterprise system.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is another article in the long battle(between cats and dogs) on the role of patch control. Some people believe that all systems should be immediately patched to prevent any and all known security bugs and anything less is negligence. On the other end are people who believe that once a system is in place it should never be patched because that could affect the stability of the applications residing in the system. Neither of these extremes are correct and this is where risk management comes into play.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Consider an enterprise with hundreds of apps, maybe 30% of them are customized. If they patched all their systems, Windows, Linux, Firefox, or any other software they may have, without testing the patch, this could have unintended consequences that could break custom apps, or other apps residing on the system. While they will be more secure, they will lower user satisfaction and affect business output. While security is important, if the business does not function we all have to go look for other jobs, and thats not as enjoyable as it sounds.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Often I hear people state that security patches are just to fix holes and that shouldn’t have an effect on systems anyway. In theory this is true, however patches don’t usually only patch security holes, they often fix other things, or add features that may interfere with software residing on a system.&nbsp; With silent updates, an enterprise may not be aware of the patch until it is already in place. The last thing an IT person who has to do support will want is software that is changing without their consent, or at least their knowledge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In some corporations I have worked, Information Technology departments will install a software update server where they can download patches and test them in a QA environment before rolling them to clients. While this delays the installation of a patch, it does allow the company to test their applications on it before rolling it out. Like any QA in IT, most companies do not want to spend time/money on this and either roll out patches haphazardly or do not roll them out at all. This is obviously poor security and shows either a lack of risk management, or a conscious decision to take a much higher level of risk. Either of these are not an excuse to push management of patches back onto the vendor. The systems belong to the company and as such are the company’s responsibility. And upper management is going to blame IT anyway, so we might as well attempt QA.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The article does discuss patching strategies, and points out that vendors are putting two types of patches out, emergency patches, and patches on regular schedule such as quarterly. This does not help IT departments unless vendors post the patch early allowing IT to test them in their environment. Also, if the patch does break an existing internal system, then IT has to have a way to prevent the patch until either a fix is in place, or the risks are weighed and the patch is blocked permanently. Silent updates performed by the vendor could cause some real damage if left unchecked.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ultimately it comes down to risk management. Do we want vendors to roll updates silently, and control risk management for us, or should Information Security Officers step up and perform risk management themselves, in conjunction with upper management of course. While the article makes a good point on how to secure an application (browsers in this case). In the real world, most enterprise environments are too complex to allow vendors to perform silent updates. Obviously this is a panther’s perspective, any dogs want to argue?
