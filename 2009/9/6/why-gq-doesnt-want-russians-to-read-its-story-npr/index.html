                                For war journalist Scott Anderson, the most confounding part of his recent assignment for <em>GQ</em> magazine to explore the root of terrorist acts in Russia a decade ago wasn't the suggestion of treachery and subterfuge he found.

                                        Scott Anderson, a veteran war correspondent, says he's disappointed <em>GQ</em> was frightened of circulating his story. "If you're worried about repercussions and you bow to them, you're basically surrendering to the other side."

                                        Scott Anderson, a veteran war correspondent, says he's disappointed <em>GQ</em> was frightened of circulating his story. "If you're worried about repercussions and you bow to them, you're basically surrendering to the other side."

                                It was the reception his story ultimately received in the United States.

                                "It was quite mysterious to me," Anderson says. "All of a sudden, it became clear that they were going to run the article but they were going to try to bury it under a rock as much as they possibly could."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anderson, 50, is an accomplished reporter and novelist who has written previously for <em>Harper's Magazine</em>, <em>The New York Times Magazine</em>, and <em>Vanity Fair</em>.

                                His investigative piece, published in the September American edition of <em>GQ</em>, challenges the official line on a series of bombings that killed hundreds of people in 1999 in Russia. It profiles a former KGB agent who spoke in great detail and on the record, at no small risk to himself. But instead of trumpeting his reporting, <em>GQ's</em> corporate owners went to extraordinary lengths to try to ensure no Russians will ever see it.
