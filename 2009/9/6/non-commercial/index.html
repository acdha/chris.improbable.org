                        <blockquote>
                            If you haven't listened to <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7661663613180520595">Larry Lessig's 23C3 talk</a>, it's worthwhile to listen to the argument he makes. As I was listening to it, I was struck by the term non-commercial, and, having given it some thought, think that we need a better word to describe the goals <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> is pursuing.
                            <p>
                                The term non-commercial reminded me deeply of the invention of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-secret_encryption">non-secret encryption</a> by James Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm Williamson at the British GCHQ. Despite having invented what the world now calls <em>public key encryption</em>, the idea languished under both classification and a failure to make the critical jump from 'non-secret' to 'public.' Even when something isn't a secret, you might not want to shout it from the rooftops, unless you're Whit Diffie. In which case you might think that it would be great to have a phone book full of keys. Whit probably wouldn't have thought of that with 'non-secret' keys, but he certainly did think of a directory of public keys.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Defining your movement by what you are not isn't the best way to rally people to the cause. No one claims to be on either the anti-life or anti-choice side of the abortion debate. Beyond that, I'm going to say that non-commercial as a descriptor may be essential in the legal licenses associated with the Creative Commons licenses. Non-commercial may even be almost the right word but, as Mark Twain pointed out, the difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large matter--it's the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So in seeking the right word, it may help to think about what we mean by non-commercial? We mean almost every word we say to our families, children, or lovers. We mean pillow talk, explaining to kids why the sky is blue, and that I would prefer not to live as a vegitable. We mean our scientific papers, our poems and our fair use of the song <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/classes/siva/archives/002248.html">Happy Birthday</a>. We mean blogging (others may see their blogs as commercial), asking a stranger directions, talking to our elected representatives, water cooler chatter, graffiti, and even all the unneeded words we say to a cashier in a checkout line.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's honest speech. It's human speech. Let's not demean it by asserting that commercial speech is the norm.
                            </p>
