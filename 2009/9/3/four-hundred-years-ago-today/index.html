                        <blockquote>
                            From Russell Shorto's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400078679?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=makiligh-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1400078679">The Island at the Center of the World</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=makiligh-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1400078679" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important">:</em>
                            <blockquote>
                                And so they continued north: misty mornings, bloody sunsets, a stretch of coast like a long smooth cut; surf eternally pounding the belt of sand; wild silence beyond. They were aware that they were shouldering a new world, impossibly dark, utterly unknown, of imponderable dimension, and with no clear means of access.
                                <p>
                                    And then they felt something happening. Rounding a hooked point, they were startled at what they perceived to be three rivers; cliffs rose up--the land "very pleasant and high, and bold to fall withal." They were in the outer reaches of New York Harbor, riding along the coast of Staten Island. Fish streamed thickly around them: salmon, mullet, wraith-like rays. They anchored and went ashore, marveling at primordial oaks and "an abundance of blue plums."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Then, just like that, people appeared. They came at them frankly, dressed in skins, peaceable, and with an air of dignity, offering corn bread and green tobacco. In 1801 the Moravian missionary John Heckewelder interviewed a Long Island Indian and published an account of Hudson's arrival from the Indian perspective. The story, supposedly handed down through generations of Delaware Indians, gibes with the account by Hudson's mate Robert Juet of the first encounter: peaceable, wary, curious. The Indian told of sighting "a large house of various colors" floating on the water (Dutch ships were indeed vividly painted with geometric motifs). As in Juet's version, the Indian story has the first meeting taking place on land, with several of the visitors, including their leader, rowing ashore. The Indian story adds that the leader of all the newcomers is dressed in "a red coat all glittering with gold lace"--a nice and by no means incongruous addition to the portrait of Hudson.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Out came the products. Hemp, dried currants, oysters, beans. Knives, hatchets, and beads. Over the next three days, as the ship explored an intricate mesh of islands, bays, and rivers, making the rounds of Brooklyn, Staten Island, and coastal New Jersey, there would be two violent encounters with Indians, which Juet claims were iniated by the Indians. People died. It's ironic that immediately upon entering the watery perimeter of what would become New York City, these two things would take place: trade and violence.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Hudson then sailed his small, three-masted wooden vessel ito the coliseum-like interior of the harbor--"a very good harbor for all windes." From his perch on the high poop-deck, looking down on his crew, he gave the order to proceed upriver. His heart must have quickened as the vista unfolded before him. "The River is a mile broad; there is very high Land on both sides," wrote Juet--as likely a channel into the other side of the world as one could hope for. Upriver, they encountered more natives: "a very loving people...and we were well taken care of." Hudson went ashore with them, visiting their circular house made of bark. "The land is the finest for cultivation that I ever in my life set foot upon," he wrote. He and his men noted more offerings from the locals: furs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Then it ended. The river grew narrow and shallow: no ship could pass through; Asia did not lie over there. They turned south again: more skirmishes with the Indians of the southern reaches of the river. It's not certain that Hudson was aware that the land they "rode quietly" past one rainy night was an island--in the first written record of the name, Juet refers to "the side of the river called <em>Manna-hatta."</em> In any case, while Hudson dutifully noted the possibilities for trade--the grandness of the harbor and the river, the toehold they would provide onto the continent--his own gaze never left the horizon of his obsession. He headed for home, empty-handed.

                            </blockquote>Hudson entered New York Harbor on September 3, 1609. He sailed past Manhattan for the second and final time, on his way back to the open sea, on September 11.

Shorto draws heavily on a trove of hitherto-obscure primary sources to elevate the story of New Amsterdam from half-remembered folktale to real history. While the English settlers in North America were still thundering at one another over finer and finer degrees of religious purity, the Dutch were planting the seeds of a city based on an unsentimental tolerance of difference and a single-minded devotion to trade. We live in that city today.
