                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    <em>by publius</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In 2005, Peter Daou wrote <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061006110230/http://daoureport.salon.com/synopsis.aspx?synopsisId=147a2536-4de0-4716-9cc0-6c681e095ffd">a seminal essay</a> called "The Triangle," which (among other things) examined the relationship between blogs and the "mainstream" media (MSM).&nbsp; Daou's framework provides the best context for understanding the wingers' recent victory lap on ACORN.&nbsp; As it turns out, the celebration has very little to do with ACORN -- and far more to do with larger institutional fights with the MSM to control political narratives.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The dynamics of the "Noise Machine" and the MSM are pretty familiar by now.&nbsp; Stories percolate and get repeated endlessly within the Noise Machine by people like Rush, Hannity, Beck, Fox News, Drudge, Malkin, Reynolds, and dozens of more activism-focused blogs (e.g., RedState).&nbsp; These daily outrages are virtually always absurd.&nbsp; But they keep getting repeated over and over, in the hopes that they will eventually break through into the MSM.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The genius of the strategy, though, is that the MSM's refusal to air these outrages <em>itself becomes part of the attack</em>.&nbsp; In this respect, accusations of liberal bias become potent weapons in the larger war to influence MSM coverage.&nbsp; For instance, under Daou's framework, the attack on the MSM's refusal to cover ACORN is a critical part of a much larger political strategy to influence the MSM.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At this point, we can begin to see ACORN's true importance.&nbsp; The "video" is important not because it reveals some larger "truth" about ACORN, but because it is <em>useful</em> in this larger institutional battle to control national media narratives.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Frankly, the MSM has gotten much better since 2002 about ignoring the more absurd stories emanating from the Noise Machine.&nbsp; Beck and the birther nonsense haven't helped the cause in that respect.&nbsp; For that reason, though, the Noise Machine desperately needed to rehabilitate and strengthen the "MSM is biased" argument.&nbsp; Without that crucial weapon, it's very hard to storm the MSM's castle.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    ACORN has, at long last, delivered the goods (much like Dan Rather before it).&nbsp; But ACORN itself is not essential to the strategy.&nbsp; It can be anything -- from town halls, to school songs, to whatever.&nbsp; The Noise Machine just needs a tool for bullying the media into accepting their garbage.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That's what makes the media's self-flagellation on ACORN so disappointing.&nbsp; The Becks of the world have been after ACORN for years, with little to show.&nbsp; And now that they've found one set of videos of stupid employees, we're apparently supposed to forget everything else they've hurled that has proven false.&nbsp; It's like bizarro venture capital.&nbsp; You invest in a hundred absurd arguments, and hope that one or two "make it" to fund <em>future</em> absurd arguments.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And it's particularly frustrating that <em>Jon Stewart</em> of all people fell for this crap.&nbsp; Yes, it's completely legitimate to have the ACORN video on The Daily Show.&nbsp; It makes for good political humor.&nbsp; But Stewart went further with an <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/16/jon-stewart-to-media-on-acorn-where-the-hell-were-you/">uncharacteristic whine</a>, "Where were you media?" -- as if this were truly a legitimate story in the first place.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It was all part of the game, yo -- and Stewart got played.&nbsp; Glenn Beck was Clay Davis to Stewart's Strang'.
