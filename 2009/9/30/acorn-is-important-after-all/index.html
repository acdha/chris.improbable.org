                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    <em>by publius</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In 2005, Peter Daou wrote <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20061006110230/http://daoureport.salon.com/synopsis.aspx?synopsisId=147a2536-4de0-4716-9cc0-6c681e095ffd">a seminal essay</a> called "The Triangle," which (among other things) examined the relationship between blogs and the "mainstream" media (MSM).  Daou's framework provides the best context for understanding the wingers' recent victory lap on ACORN.  As it turns out, the celebration has very little to do with ACORN -- and far more to do with larger institutional fights with the MSM to control political narratives.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The dynamics of the "Noise Machine" and the MSM are pretty familiar by now.  Stories percolate and get repeated endlessly within the Noise Machine by people like Rush, Hannity, Beck, Fox News, Drudge, Malkin, Reynolds, and dozens of more activism-focused blogs (e.g., RedState).  These daily outrages are virtually always absurd.  But they keep getting repeated over and over, in the hopes that they will eventually break through into the MSM.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The genius of the strategy, though, is that the MSM's refusal to air these outrages <em>itself becomes part of the attack</em>.  In this respect, accusations of liberal bias become potent weapons in the larger war to influence MSM coverage.  For instance, under Daou's framework, the attack on the MSM's refusal to cover ACORN is a critical part of a much larger political strategy to influence the MSM.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At this point, we can begin to see ACORN's true importance.  The "video" is important not because it reveals some larger "truth" about ACORN, but because it is <em>useful</em> in this larger institutional battle to control national media narratives.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Frankly, the MSM has gotten much better since 2002 about ignoring the more absurd stories emanating from the Noise Machine.  Beck and the birther nonsense haven't helped the cause in that respect.  For that reason, though, the Noise Machine desperately needed to rehabilitate and strengthen the "MSM is biased" argument.  Without that crucial weapon, it's very hard to storm the MSM's castle.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    ACORN has, at long last, delivered the goods (much like Dan Rather before it).  But ACORN itself is not essential to the strategy.  It can be anything -- from town halls, to school songs, to whatever.  The Noise Machine just needs a tool for bullying the media into accepting their garbage. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That's what makes the media's self-flagellation on ACORN so disappointing.  The Becks of the world have been after ACORN for years, with little to show.  And now that they've found one set of videos of stupid employees, we're apparently supposed to forget everything else they've hurled that has proven false.  It's like bizarro venture capital.  You invest in a hundred absurd arguments, and hope that one or two "make it" to fund <em>future</em> absurd arguments.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And it's particularly frustrating that <em>Jon Stewart</em> of all people fell for this crap.  Yes, it's completely legitimate to have the ACORN video on The Daily Show.  It makes for good political humor.  But Stewart went further with an <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2009/09/16/jon-stewart-to-media-on-acorn-where-the-hell-were-you/">uncharacteristic whine</a>, "Where were you media?" -- as if this were truly a legitimate story in the first place.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It was all part of the game, yo -- and Stewart got played.  Glenn Beck was Clay Davis to Stewart's Strang'.
