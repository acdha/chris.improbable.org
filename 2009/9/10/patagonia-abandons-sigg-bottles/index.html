                        <blockquote>
                            Eu-Jin Goh pointed out to me that <a href="http://www.thecleanestline.com/2009/09/patagonia-terminates-relationship-with-sigg-water-bottles.html">Patagonia is cancelling their relationship with Sigg</a>:
                            <blockquote>
                                Patagonia formally announced on September 4th that it would terminate all co-branding and co-marketing efforts with SIGG, Inc. It has come to Patagonia's attention from recent news reports that a Bisphenol A (BPA) epoxy coating was used in most aluminum SIGG bottles manufactured prior to August 2008, despite earlier assurances from SIGG that the liners of their bottles did not contain BPA. Bisphenol A is a chemical that Patagonia does not support the use of in consumer products, hence the company has terminated its co-branding relationship with SIGG. In addition, Patagonia is ceasing the sale of SIGG bottles in its stores, as well as through its catalog and on-line distribution.
                                <p>
                                    ...
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "We did our homework on the topic of BPA, going all the way back to 2005 when this subject first emerged in discussions in scientific journals" Rick Ridgeway, Patagonia's VP of environmental initiatives states. "We even arranged for one of the leading scientists on BPA research to come to our company to educate us on the issue. Once we concluded there was basis for concern, we immediately pulled all drinking bottles that contained BPA from our shelves and then searched for a BPA-free bottle. We very clearly asked SIGG if there was BPA in their bottles and their liners, and they clearly said there was not. After conducting such thorough due diligence, we are more than chagrined to see the ad that is appearing in Backpacker, but we also feel that with this explanation our customers will appreciate and understand our position."
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                The last paragraph is the most interesting for me. In Sigg's public statements, it seems like they were mostly evasive, but it would be interesting to know if they flat-out lied to Patagonia. I'm starting to think Sigg may take a pretty big hit here: people bought their product cause they were trying to get away from BPA and seem more upset with Sigg than with Nalge, who never denied their product had BPA in it, just kept saying it was OK until they finally caved and brought out a non-BPA bottle. So, even though it seems like there was more BPA risk from Nalgene (if you believe the studies) people seem more angry at Sigg because they feel like Sigg wasn't honest.
                            </p>
