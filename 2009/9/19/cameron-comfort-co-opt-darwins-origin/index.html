                        <blockquote>
                            I've had my head in the sand writing revisions of papers before the quarter starts, so I'm sure there is information all over the net about this that I am not integrating here, sorry. But apparently, Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort have co-opted Darwin's ..<span style="font-style:italic">Origin of Species</span>... and inserted creationist propaganda into in introduction that is mixed with some facts (i.e. biographical facts on Darwin). It also includes propaganda linking Nazi-ism and evolution, etc.<br>
                            <br>
                            They plan to had out published copies at the 'Top 50' research institutions in the US. Cameron in a video mentions he will come to a local university personally (here at UCSB? UCLA? I'm not sure what "local" is to Mr. Cameron).<br>
                            <br>
                            Apparently, Richard Dawkins has been involved in getting the word out to evolutionists to expect this, kudos to him and his crew for doing that.<br>
                            <br>
                            I personally disagree with the plan of action I'm told Dawkins' camp is promoting (I haven't confirmed that he is actually promoting this). That plan entails obtaining as many copies of the book as possible and removing the Comfort introductory propaganda.<br>
                            <br>
                            In my opinion, this is not a good strategy. It seems that this could look desperate, as if scientists actually have something to worry about (when it comes to the facts of evolution, we do not have to worry), and it looks like book burning or censoring.<br>
                            <br>
                            Instead, I think a concise pamphlet refuting the bogus claims of the introdution would be outstanding. It could have references and web links, and could also expose what I see as the breathtaking inanity of Comfort and Cameron's crusade against critical, rational thinking.<br>
                            <br>
                            It would be great if someone like the NCSE were involved. Time is short and an organized response would nice.<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Below, I attach an email that was sent around here at UCSB, which includes web links to some of this stuff:<br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Colleagues,<br>
                            <br>
                            We all loved Kirk Cameron on Growing Pains:<br>
                            <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vo2i3NFq78&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vo2i3NFq78&amp;feature=related</a><br>
                            <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vo2i3NFq78&amp;feature=related"></a><br>
                            <br>
                            Years later we were amused and perhaps a bit alarmed at his<br>
                            'Origin of the Banana' video:<br>
                            <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z-OLG0KyR4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z-OLG0KyR4</a><br>
                            (That's Ray Comfort there with him)<br>
                            <br>
                            But in November of 2009 he and Ray Comfort are taking it to the<br>
                            next level: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9zpf5cT0M">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN9zpf5cT0M</a><br>
                            <br>
                            The Important thing for us: *THIS GIVE AWAY WILL HAPPEN AT<br>
                            UCSB! On November 19th!<br>
                            *<br>
                            Richard Dawkins has proposed a strategy: Collect as many of these<br>
                            books as possible, remove the 50 page intro and donate the copies<br>
                            to schools, libraries, or the whoever<br>
                            (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=155609217391">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=155609217391</a>)<br>
                            <br>
                            We can stick with this strategy or come up with something else but<br>
                            we should do <b><span>*</span>SOMETHING<span>*</span></b><br>
                            <br>
                            Basically we need to get organized if they are coming here. Ready<br>
                            with information &amp;/or to get these books. Ready with pamphlets<br>
                            answering his questions or just trying to keep them off campus?<br>
                            <br>
                            *Who would be into meeting within the next couple of weeks to<br>
                            start to get ourselves organized?*<br>
                            <br>
                            If you are not ready for action now here are some highlights from<br>
                            Comfort's 50 page Intro:<br>
                            <br>
                            1) So, even though we share 96 percent of our genetic make-up with<br>
                            chimps, that does not mean we are 96 percent chimp. Be careful you<br>
                            don’t fall for the illogic of this “evolutionary proof,”<br>
                            2) here are some interesting questions for the thinking<br>
                            evolutionist: Can you explain which came first—the blood or the heart—and why?<br>
                            3) You’ve probably been led to believe that the first simple<br>
                            creatures had rudimentary eyes, and that as creatures slowly<br>
                            evolved their eyes evolved along with them. however, that’s not<br>
                            what scientists have found.
