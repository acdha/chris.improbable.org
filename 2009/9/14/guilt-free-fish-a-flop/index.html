                            <p>
                                <span style="display:inline"><img alt="msc_logo.gif" src="http://scienceblogs.com/guiltyplanet/msc_logo.gif" width="150" height="107" style="float:right;margin:0 0 20px 20px"></span>A lot of people who don't want to feel guilty about eating seafood will look for the MSC logo. The MSC (or <a href="http://www.msc.org/">Marine Stewardship Council</a>) supposedly certifies sustainable fisheries. They aim to reward good fisheries management by providing access to niche markets (<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/guiltyplanet/2009/08/test_if_youre_an_eco-douchebag.php">the same markets concerned with their bread slicers</a>) and the lure of higher profits (although this hasn't seemed to happen so far). Four recent events reveal the fishiness of MSC-certification -- a process many fisheries scientists supported at its inception but now doubt.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                1) <a href="http://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2009/09/14/wastedfishfood/">Certified wasted fish</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Daniel Pauly and I have <a href="http://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2009/09/14/wastedfishfood/">an article out today at the Vancouver-based Tyee</a> on why the proposed MSC-certification of Peruvian anchovy is a bad idea. Whether or not the fish is caught sustainably is beside the point. The real issue, in this case, is what is done with the fish after they are caught--and, in the case of the anchovy, these tasty little fish are turned into fishmeal to feed factory-farmed fish or pigs and chickens (animals that shouldn't be eating fish to begin with). It's like certifying wood as sustainable and then turning it into mulch.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2) A sustainable fishery shut down?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Next up, our old friend pollock--a fish that makes its way into the McDonald's Filet-o-Fish and a fish that dons the MSC seal of approval. However, according to <a>this recent article in the Economist</a>, the pollock fishery is also in dire Bering straits. Friends at Greenpeace (who never approved of the MSC-certification due to the fact that the certification ignored ecosystem effects, such as how much pollock sea lions in the area need for food) heard that pollock stock assessments are so low that under the fishery rules, the pollock fishery should be shut down for next season. If one of the best managed or most heavily managed fisheries in the world shuts down, what does that say for management? And what does it say for the MSC?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                3) An ugly fish with an ugly fate
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Hoki is another fish that makes its way into the McDonald's Filet-o-Fish and this fishery off of New Zealand was certified by the MSC in 2001. You can read all about its demise in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/science/10fish.html?no_interstitial">the New York Times article out last week</a>. Environmental groups have always been concerned about the high levels of accidentally caught sharks and rays, but now it seems that the hoki themselves are in trouble. The hoki stock is in decline and the quota has decreased by two-thirds. If a fishery is in trouble and managers lower the quota, the MSC would say that's a good sign--management is responding to a fishery in trouble. But a fishery in trouble is a bad sign for marine ecology and for the premise of sustainability.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                4) Pacific hake doesn't make the grade
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Pacific hake is another popular fish for pulverized products like fish patties and fish sticks (see a pattern yet?). It is also up for MSC-certification. Oceana and the Monterey Bay Aquarium have co-authored a 50-page objection to the certification on several grounds. To quote the Oceans letter: "The Pacific hake fishery is being managed closer to the edge of disaster than sustainability." The two groups argue management does not take ecosystem effects into account (like the fact that sea lion feed on lots of hake). Estimates of stock status indicate that the stock is now at the lowest spawning biomass ever observed and is projected to decline further in the next three years under current harvest management.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These examples show how the MSC certification process has been co-opted by industry. But there is some good news: they also show that there is pressure to certify fisheries due to a heartening desire from consumers to have sustainable fish.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The problem is, most fisheries simply aren't sustainable under their current management practices. Putting a logo on them doesn't change that even if consumers might feel less guilt at dinnertime. Fisheries are broken and the MSC is broken as a result. We need to fix them both. And fast.
