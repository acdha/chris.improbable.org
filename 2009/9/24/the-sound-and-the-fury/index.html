                                    In light of the increasingly frenetic calls to reject Gen. McChrystal's report and to bring the troops back home from Afghanistan, it's worth looking at what Gen. McChrystal actually said.  The unclassified version of McChrystal's report is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/21/AR2009092100110.html">here</a>.  The striking part of McChrystal's report is how different the report is from its caricature in the press.  George Packer is correct when he <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/georgepacker/2009/09/reading-the-mcchrystal-report.html">writes</a>:  
                                </p>

                                        McChrystal’s report is written in plain English, it’s self-critical, and it shows more understanding of the nature of the fight in Afghanistan than most journalism and academic work. The U.S. military now believes that the Afghan government is just as much a threat to success as the Taliban. That’s a bold conclusion, one that our civilians have not been willing to reach, publicly at least. And the description of the different Taliban networks is as clarifying as it is disturbing.

                                    The question McChrystal's report poses is not "do we send more troops?" but "do we engage in a different strategy?"  Indeed, the debate over Afghanistan is not about sending more troops.  Here is McChrystal addressing this very point in his <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/21/AR2009092100110.html">Commander's Summary</a>:
                                </p>

                                        Success is achievable, but it will not be attained simply by trying harder or "doubling down" on the previous strategy. Additional resources are required, but focusing on force or resource requirements <em><strong>misses the point entirely</strong></em>. The key take away from this assessment is the urgent need for a significant change to our strategy and the way that we think and operate.
                                    </p>

                                    (Emphasis mine.)  And how would McChrystal change the way coalition forces "think and operate"?

                                        Our strategy cannot be focused on seizing terrain or destroying insurgent forces; our objective must be the population. In the struggle to gain the support ofthe people, every action we take must enable this effort. The population also represents a powerful actor that can and must be leveraged in this complex system. Gaining their support will require a better understanding of the people's choices and needs. However, progress is hindered by the dual threat of a resilient insurgency and a crisis of confidence in the government and the international coalition. To win their support, we must protect the people from both of these threats.

                                        Many describe the conflict in Afghanistan as a war of ideas, which I believe to be true. However, this is a 'deeds-based' information environment where perceptions derive from actions, such as how we interact with the population and how quickly things improve.  ...

                                    Read the whole thing.  If you think that US interests are best served by leaving Afghanistan as a failed state or under Taliban control, it won't change your outlook on the war.  You'll still want the troops to come home.
