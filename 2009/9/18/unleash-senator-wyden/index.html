                                    Senator Wyden (D-Ore.) has a health care bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I've written in the past, <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2009/07/the-science-of-myth-reviving-the-wydenbennett-plan.html">it's a pretty damn good bill</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not alone in liking it:&nbsp; lots of other folks on the left and right do as well.&nbsp; Moreover,&nbsp;unlike all the other major health care bills out there, Wyden's bill is genuinely bipartisan:&nbsp; it has a prominent&nbsp;Republican co-sponser in <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/09/16/obama-steps-up-senate-lobbying-on-health/">Bob Bennett</a>&nbsp;(R-Utah).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Wyden has been pretty low-key regarding his plan while Sen.&nbsp;Baucus has tried to hammer out an alternative bill with&nbsp;bipartisan support.&nbsp; (Bennett's been pretty low key because he risks <a href="http://www.redstate.com/erick/2009/09/16/it-is-time-to-go-to-defcon-1-bob-bennett-is-about-to-screw-america/">catching hell</a>&nbsp;from some&nbsp;on the hard right for anything that looks like cooperation with the Democrats.)&nbsp; Now that Baucus' proposed compromise&nbsp;is in&nbsp;trouble&nbsp;-- heck, it doesn't even have the Democratic votes to&nbsp;make it out of committee -- Wyden has&nbsp;started speaking up.&nbsp; This is a good thing.&nbsp; His editorial in yesterday's New York Times is particularly worth reading <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/17/opinion/17wyden.html?_r=2&amp;ref=opinion">because it hits on the fundamental problem with the other proposed "reforms" that are circulating in Washington</a>:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        Under the nation’s current employer-based system, most people have little if any choice about where they get their insurance. They just have to accept the plan that comes with their job. That insurance company, in turn, is provided a captive group of customers, so it has no incentive to earn their loyalty.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Empowering Americans to choose from a broad selection of health plans would turn the tables. Those insurers that charged affordable rates and provided good coverage would attract more customers, while those that treated customers badly would be forced to change their ways or go out of business. To stay competitive, insurers would need to follow the example of places like the Mayo Clinic and offer good, low-cost coverage.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The various bills making their way through Congress would, as the president explained, provide some consumer choice by establishing large marketplaces where people could easily compare insurance plans and pick the one that best suits their needs. Companies participating in these insurance exchanges would be required to offer coverage to anyone who wants to buy it, regardless of their age, gender or health status, and they would be barred from charging someone more for having a pre-existing condition.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The problem with these bills, however, is that they would not make the exchanges available to all Americans. Only very small companies and those individuals who can’t get insurance outside of the exchange — 25 million people — would be allowed to shop there. This would leave more than 200 million Americans with no more options, private or public, than they have today.
                                    </p>

                                    First, this is exactly the debate that we should be having over health care.&nbsp; The fundamental problems with the American health care system are&nbsp;all linked, directly or indirectly,&nbsp;to the fact that the vast majority of folks get insurance solely through their employers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Employers don't&nbsp;necessarily choose health care plans&nbsp;the same way that individuals do.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having employers provide health care also restricts choice, stratifies the&nbsp;market, and&nbsp;burdens small business.&nbsp;&nbsp;Insurers&nbsp;need only deal with a handful of potential customers, who vary widely in their bargaining power and position (General Electric&nbsp;= powerful customer; you&nbsp;= not so powerful customer).&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                </p>

                                    Second, the advantages of Wyden-Bennett exchanges&nbsp;has not been lost on Sen. Baucus -- but he's doing it wrong.&nbsp; As Publius has noted, <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2009/09/baucuss-exchanges-are-good.html">one of the good aspects of Baucus' bill</a>&nbsp;is that it provides for a Wyden-like exchange.&nbsp; The problem, however, is that Baucus'&nbsp;version of the&nbsp;Wyden-Bennett exchanges&nbsp;is fundamentally flawed because it is still&nbsp;linked to employer-provided health care.&nbsp; It's not enough to let&nbsp;many&nbsp;employers into the exchange.&nbsp; If we are going to divorce insurance from employment, we have to let <em><strong>individuals</strong></em> into the&nbsp;exchange.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p dir="ltr">
                                    Third, Matt Yglesias is wrong on the strategy.&nbsp; Yglesias&nbsp;<a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/09/the-ingenious-don-ron-wyden-of-oregon.php">"[p]ersonally" thinks that Wyden-Bennet "is a good idea."</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>But:</strong></em>
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p dir="ltr">
                                        .... I think it’s pretty clear at this point that the most feasible way to get what Wyden wants is to enact something that falls within the broad Obama/Waxman/Baucus/Dodd family[*] of relatively cautious reform and then have the debate about opening the exchange at some point in the future when people are less freaked out.
                                    </p>
                                </blockquote>

                                        The public opinion research indicating that it’s important to promise the insured they can keep their insurance is pretty overwhelming. <em><strong>Ron Wyden is right and the public is wrong, but this is one of these situations in which being right isn’t going to help you very much and tilting at this particular windmill at this moment in time doesn’t strike me as very productive</strong></em>.
                                    </p>

                                    Assuming&nbsp;that folks are too stupid to know what's best for them is a bad idea.&nbsp; If Yglesias is right, then you'll never get Wyden-Bennett because the people will never be smart enough to get it.&nbsp; May as well give up.&nbsp; And, true or not, you've just insulted the intelligence of the electorate.&nbsp; You don't pass good bills this way.&nbsp; You pass good bills by persuading folks&nbsp;... and assuming that they're capable of understanding why you're right.&nbsp;

                                    Yglesias'&nbsp;notion that&nbsp;one can&nbsp;use a Baucus-style exchange as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel's_nose">camel's nose</a> is also highly suspect.&nbsp; I don't know why an exchange that includes only employers would naturally grow to include employees as well.&nbsp; Indeed, it seems that employer-only exchanges are a step in the wrong direction, particularly when coupled to mandates that employers provide coverage.&nbsp; Each&nbsp;reinforces the link between employment and insurance -- the opposite direction from where we want to go.&nbsp;
                                </p>

                                    Wyden&nbsp;might be tilting at windmills, but not for the reasons that&nbsp;Yglesias provides.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p dir="ltr">
                                    <strong>UPDATE:&nbsp;</strong> One of the biggest canards regarding Wyden-Bennett is that it would force people who like&nbsp;their current, employer-provided insurance to give it up. &nbsp;This ain't true.&nbsp; There's no forcing in the Wyden-Bennett exchanges. An exchange may give you options, but it won't force you to adopt any one of those options.&nbsp; You could still choose to be covered by your employer, although the hope is that employer-provided health care would gradually die as individuals find that they can get a better deal through an exchange.
                                </p>

                                    *I have no idea what Yglesias means by "the broad Obama/Waxman/Baucus/Dodd family of relatively cautious reform."&nbsp; There are deep structural differences between these various Democratic proposals.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Yglesias meant to write:&nbsp; "any bill proposed by a Democrat who is not Ron Wyden."
