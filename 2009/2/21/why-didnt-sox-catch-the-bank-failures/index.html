                        <p class="annotation">
                            The one unresolved question: will SOX mean that there's more damning evidence left behind for this round of failures?
                        </p>

                                Iang recently indicted the entire audit industry with <a href="https://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/001140.html">"Two Scary Words: Sarbanes-Oxley"</a>. I've excerpted several chunks below:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                Let's check the record: did any audit since Sarbanes-Oxley pick up any of the problems seen in the last 18 months to do with the financial crisis?
                                <p>
                                    No. Not one, not even a single one!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Yet, the basic failures in the financial crisis are so blatant that surely, even by accident at least one audit should have picked up at least one pending failure, and fixed it? No, not one, known to date. At least, as far as I know, and we should probably wait a few years before writing the final judgment.<br>
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                and
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                Can we pronounce the financial audit as bankrupt by its own measures? In theory, the audit should have picked up these failures, all of them. Consider this case-in-point, to prove that the theory works: the enhanced audit required on public listing did in fact pick up the Refco fraud that led quickly to its failure, and the near-failure of Bawag, a big bank in Austria that participated in the fraud. (The sorry fool who found the fraud was fired for his troubles, and only later did his reports filter out and cause questions that ultimately forced the fatal result.)
                                <p>
                                    The audit theory works, then, in some sense or other. Manifestly, audits didn't work for the financial crisis. And, they so didn't work after that so-huge rewrite called Sarbanes-Oxley, that we can conclude that mere improvement is completely off the agenda
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                The thing about SOX is that while it is hugely in-depth as audit requirements go, it is also incredibly narrow in it's breath in terms of how it is implemented by companies and how it is audited. Auditors are so busy ensuring that someone isn't cooking the books that they don't look for people deluding themselves or who don't understand their own inputs or whether or not the source data for the models was reasonable. This is why Refco was identified and the bank failures were not. And if there this is an actual failure of SOX this is it. Not that it didn't catch the bank failures but that it was <b>never designed to do so in the first place</b>. If all you are worried about is nails, all you look for is hammers.
