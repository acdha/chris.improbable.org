                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Over at Mind Matters, I recently <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=defense-social-neuroscience">interviewed</a> Matthew Lieberman, a social neuroscientist at UCLA. The previous week I asked <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=brain-scan-results-overstated">Ed Vul</a>, lead author of the "<a href="http://www.edvul.com/pdf/Vul_etal_2008inpress.pdf">Voodoo Correlations</a>" paper a few questions, and I wanted to make sure I gave some of the scientists he criticized a chance to rebut the accusations. (Here's some excellent <a href="http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2008/12/voodoo_correlations_.html">background</a> reading on the Voodoo controversy.) I think Lieberman makes some excellent points:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                The argument that Vul and colleagues put forward in their paper is that correlations observed in social neuroscience papers are impossibly high. There's a metric (the product of the reliabilities of the two variables) that determines just how high of a correlation can be observed between two variables. They suggest that because, on average, this metric allows correlations as high as 0.74, that social neuroscientists should never see correlations higher than that.
                                <p>
                                    Given the gravity of the claim, it's important to get this [figure] right, but they do not. Here's their mistake: it's not the average of this metric that determines what can be observed in a study, but rather the metric for that particular study or at the very least, the metric estimated from prior use of the actual measures in that study. Just because the average price of groceries in a supermarket is $3 does not mean you cannot find a $12 item. In fact, a study that I'm an author on (and is a major target in the Vul et al. paper) is a perfect example. The reliability of the self-report measure in our study is far higher than the average they report allowing for higher observed correlations. They knew this [fact], but presented our study as violating the "theoretical upper bound" anyway.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Their second major conceptual point is that numerous social neuroscience authors were making a non-independence error. Ed Vul gives a nice example of what he means by the non-independence error in a chapter with [Massachusetts Institute of Technology neuroscientist] Nancy Kanwisher. They suggest that we might be interested in whether a psychology or a sociology course is harder and assess this [question] by comparing the grades of students who took both courses. In a comparison of all students, we find no difference in scores. But what if we began by selecting only students who scored higher in psychology than sociology and then statistically compared those? If we used the results of that analysis to draw a general inference about the two courses, this [strategy] would be a non-independence error, because the selection of the sample to test is not independent of the criterion being tested. This [practice] would massively bias the results.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Although Vul is absolutely right that this would be a major error, he's not describing what we actually do. Vul's example assumes that the question that we are interested in is how the entire brain correlates with a personality measure or responds differently to two tasks. Staying with the grades examples, what social neuroscientists are really doing, however, is something closer to asking, "Across all colleges in the country, are there colleges where psychology grades are higher than sociology grades?" In other words, the question is not what the average difference is across all schools, but rather which schools show a difference. There is nothing inappropriate about asking this question or about describing the results found in those schools where a significant effect emerges.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With whole-brain analyses in fMRI, we're doing the same thing. We are interested in where significant effects are occurring in the brain and when we find them we describe the results in terms of means, correlations, and so on. We are not cherry-picking regions and then claiming these represent the effects for the whole brain.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                In other words, the debate continues. But even Lieberman admits that the whole brouhaha has been good for the field, as the criticism has inspired a new level of rigor and skeptical analysis. A correlation is a tricky thing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We also discuss some of Lieberman's fascinating work on the reward pathway and grief and why it takes self-control to accept unfair offers.
