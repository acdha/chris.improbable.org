                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                I have so many things to say about this week at <a href="http://conferences.ted.com/TED2009/">TED2009</a>. So many stories. So very many images. And, of course, what it was like to be a photographer at such a grand event. But, to start, I want to share a very unique story. One that has no photographs to adequately illustrate it. One that will leave a permanent impression on me.
                            </p>
                            <div style="float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:20px">
                                <img src="http://duncandavidson.com/2009/02/07/badge.jpg" alt="badge.jpg" border="0" width="204" height="279" align="right">
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                It happened after working the first full day of the conference on Wednesday night. After shooting the block party. After finishing handing off the last images of the day to the rest of the photo crew. I was walking back to my hotel, the Hilton, down Ocean Boulevard. It's a 3/4 mile walk. Not a big deal, even with a backpack full of camera gear on my back. It wasn’t pleasant on feet that were sore from the day, but not bad. Mostly, I thought of if as a good way to unwind after a very full day.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As I walked under the trees by the civic center, I was grabbed from behind. Both of my arms were pulled back alongside my backpack effectively pinning my upper body. A man’s voice said, <em>“I need your badge right fucking now!”</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In a state of disbelief, and thinking this must be a very poor joke on the part of some drunk asshole, I started turning around to see who it was.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>“Don’t look at my face,”</em> my assailant said tightening his grip on my upper arms. <em>“I need to get into the event. I need your badge. I don’t want to hurt you, but I will.”</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Realizing that this wasn’t quite the drunken prank I first made it out to be, I suddenly found myself sizing up the situation I was in. I remember looking around to evaluate my surroundings. I was in dark shade under the trees. There were some people ahead of me on the sidewalk. The street was lit and a few cars were going by. My badge was hanging around my neck and inside the badge holder was my hotel key, a WhiBal, some filter gels, and some business cards. The detail of what I remember thinking about are interestingly vivid.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My attacker wasn’t what you might expect. Yes, Long Beach has a reputation and this isn’t the greatest area. But, he didn’t fit any of those stereotypes. He was white. My height, maybe a tad taller. Decently dressed in clean clothes. Neutral smelling. Close cropped hair, light I think. A bit of stubble on his cheek. And light eyes, maybe blue. Spoke neutral english. The kind of guy that would fit right in at the event without attracting attention. Of course, my description of hair and eye color are suspect because of the low light conditions and the rapidity of the event—not to mention I only got a look at the side of his face.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There were questions in my head as well. Questions like why didn’t he want my wallet? Or the camera gear on my back? Who the hell tries to mug somebody for a badge to a conference? Of course, it wasn’t just any conference. It was TED. A place where all sorts of people connect and network. People like Bill Gates, who I had photographed earlier that day. A photo that ran on NBC television and many other news outlets including newspapers around the world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I thought about the fact that my badge was an all-access pass to the show and to its attendees. Sure, it has my name and my photo on it, but even if I reported it stolen, it could possibly be modified with a different photo or be used to slip past a distracted security guard at the venue or any of the parties. As all of this went through my head, I said, <em>“You can’t have my badge. That’s just not going to happen.”</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That wasn’t the answer my assailant wanted. <em>“Look. You see those people coming towards us? They’re with me and they are going to help me fuck you up if you don’t give me that badge right now!”</em> His pull on my arms around my backpack was tightened even more as I tried to pull away.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Realizing that I couldn’t use my upper body at all—my left arm was screaming in pain at that point and my right wasn’t far behind—but stubbornly determined not to acquiesce to his demands, I started fighting my way to the curb. To the light. To where other people could see what was going on. It wasn’t easy. I tweeked my knee in the process. And I did try to break one of my arms free so that I could put an elbow into him.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As I made progress to the curb, yelling at the top of my lungs, my attacker suddenly let me go and fled, running into the night.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I walked out into the middle of the street—literally the dead center of the road—and called 911. The phone rang and rang and rang. After what seemed like an eternity, well over a minute in real time, I was finally connected and then transferred to the Long Beach Police Department. Right as I started talking to the dispatch agent, a police cruiser drove by and I flagged it down.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Long Beach police officers I talked to were great. They took my report—yes, I filed a formal report including agreeing to come back to Long Beach to testify if needed—and then drove me around for a while to look for the guy who attacked me. Other police cars were involved as well. But, even with all the information I could give, we didn't find the guy. Nor have the police contacted me since. My attacker will most likely remain unknown and unpunished.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After the fact, in the hours and days since it happened, I’ve asked myself so many questions. Not just to the nature of the attack, as bizarre as it was, but also my reactions. Why didn’t I give up the badge? What if my assailant had carried out his threats? What if he were armed with a knife or worse? In retrospect, I can remember so many details of what happened. But at the time, it was happening so fast that rational thought wasn’t part of the agenda.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As much as I remember observing in the situation, I didn’t have enough mental bandwidth to do much logical or critical thinking. My instinct said not to give up unless I had more proof that bodily harm was imminent. I didn’t want to give into the threat and do what would have been easy and expedient. As it turned out, my instinct was right. But it could have worked out differently. I dwell a bit on my actions every time I think of it. Logic says that I should have given him my badge, alerted the TED folks, and had the security folks be on the lookout for the bastard. After all, they could more closely inspect staff badges for tampering knowing that there are only just so many of them to look at. Too bad I didn’t think of that at the time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I do wonder about the motives of my attacker. I can only think of a few possibilities. Maybe the guy was a paparazzi wanting to get photos of the celbs walking about. Maybe he wanted access to the various rich and influential people that were at the conference so that he could pitch them on his hot new idea. Or maybe he meant somebody else harm. I’ll probably never know. All I know is that he didn’t want money. He wanted access.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Cash isn’t always the most important currency.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Three days later, the bruises have cycled through a few different ugly colors but are hopefully soon to fade. My knee is getting towards fine. Most of all, this moment of time—so postmodern feeling in nature—is now part of my story at TED. A place where great thinkers and optimists gather. A place that feels like a world apart but is still intrinsically part of the world that we all live in day to day. A place still subject to the lesser qualities of man even as it inspires its attendees to listen to their better angels. An event important enough that people are willing to commit crimes to gain access.
