                            Jeff Atwood is one of the examples of what's wrong with the professional bloggers: he went from being a moderately interesting programmer with a blog to a marketer driving page-views. If I wanted drama from excessively self-important people I'd spend more time on Livejournal.

                                I can’t even count the ways this attitude is wrong. If you think most programming is a boring slog, you’re not programming. You need to automate, abstract, and choose better tools. If you don’t have the imagination to work at a level where you’re solving problems instead of typing out getters and setters, you don’t have the imagination to be a developer, you’re just a typist.

                                Alex, the DailyWTF owner who wrote the post, spends time every day looking at some of the worst code ever written and he’s reacting to that: people who incompetent or over-complicate because they don’t realize that programming can be simple and straightforward. They reinvent every wheel because they either fail to realize the wheel exists or fail to recognize how it’s the solution to their problem.
                            </p>

                                And needless to say, business applications are borrrring! Nothing about the programming is stimulating. It’s all a question of managing requirements, priorities, and figuring out how to cram ninety hours worth of work into a seventy hour week to stave off the outsourcing. <cite>Raganwald, who only thought <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2006/09/business-programming-simply-isnt-that.html">he was writing parody</a></cite>

                                A virtual dress-up world is not unworthy of quality work from software professionals. I’ve never understood that this idea that work shouldn’t be fun, that some jobs are not worth doing well. Fitz and the rest of the IMVU team are doing the us a favor by blogging about the good work they’re doing, and that’s worthy of praise.
