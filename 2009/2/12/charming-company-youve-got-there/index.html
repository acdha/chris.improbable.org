                        <blockquote>
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    <em>by publius</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Even for the most cynical, this one was hard to believe.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/11/AR2009021104311.html?sid=ST2009021200082&amp;s_pos=">The Post ran a story</a> today about how more employers are challenging the unemployment benefits claims filed by their former employees.  Generally speaking, employees are entitled to these benefits unless they were "fired for misbehavior" or quit.  The ultimate benefit to the companies is lower unemployment insurance rates.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Anyway, the company here -- Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center -- apparently decided to just start making stuff up about their laid-off employee while no one was looking:
                                </p>
                                <div style="margin-left:40px">
                                    "I couldn't believe it," said Kenneth M. Brown, who lost his job as a hotel electrician in October.
                                </div>
                                <p style="margin-left:40px">
                                    He began collecting benefits of $380 a week but then discovered that his former employer, the owners of the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center, were appealing to block his unemployment benefits. The hotel alleged that he had been fired for being deceptive with a supervisor.
                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-left:40px">
                                    "A big corporation like that. . . . It was hard enough to be terminated," he said. "But for them to try to take away the unemployment benefits -- I just thought that was heartless."
                                </p>
                                <div style="margin-left:40px">
                                    <strong>After a Post reporter turned up at the hearing, the hotel's representative withdrew the appeal and declined to comment.</strong> A hotel spokesperson later said the company does not comment on legal matters.<br>
                                </div>
                                <p>
                                    <br>
                                    Charming.  I'll go out on a limb and guess that a lot of the employers' challenges where national reporters <em>don't happen to show up</em> aren't valid either. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The disparities in resources here is a serious concern -- both from a legal and information cost perspective.  That's one reason why you want a Labor Department that, you know, cares about labor.
