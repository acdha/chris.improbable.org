                                    In light of the Pentagon's preemptive and sustained campaign to&nbsp;secure significant increases in its already out-of-control budget at a time of fiscal anxiety, <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175029">Chalmers Johnson</a> has a&nbsp;timely piece examining some of the ways in which the dysfunctional Pentagon&nbsp;appropriations process leads to&nbsp;higher levels of&nbsp;spending for less overall value on the back-end.&nbsp; Johnson examines two now familiar, if underappreciated in the upper echelons of government, dynamics:

                                        More than 20 years ago, Chuck Spinney wrote a classic account of the now-routine bureaucratic scams practiced within the Pentagon to ensure that Congress will appropriate funds for dishonestly advertised and promoted weapons systems and then prevent their cancellation when the fraud comes to light. In a paper he <a href="http://www.d-n-i.net/fcs/def_power_games_98.htm">entitled "Defense Power Games,"</a> of which his superiors deeply disapproved, Spinney outlined two crucial Pentagon gambits meant to lock in such weaponry: "front-loading" and "political engineering."
                                    </p>

                                    Dealing with the second prong of that tandem first, Johnson illustrates how a project, once-approved, becomes resistant to cancellation regardless of the merits of the underlying weapons system:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right:0px">

                                        Political engineering is the strategy of awarding contracts in as many different Congressional districts as possible. By making voters and Congressional incumbents dependent on military money, the Pentagon's political engineers put pressure on them to continue supporting front-loaded programs even after their true costs become apparent. [...]
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The military-industrial complex is today so confident of its skills in gaming the system that it does not hesitate to publicize how many workers in a particular district will lose their jobs if a particular project is canceled. Threats are also made -- and put into effect -- to withhold political contributions from uncooperative congressional representatives.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As Spinney recalls, "In July 1989, when some members of Congress began to build a coalition aimed at canceling the B-2, Northrop Corporation, the B-2's prime contractor, retaliated by releasing data which had previously been classified showing that tens of thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions in profits were at risk in 46 states and 383 congressional districts." The B-2 was not canceled.

                                    Back to the&nbsp;concept of front-loading:&nbsp;
                                </p>

                                        Front-loading is the practice of appropriating funds for a new weapons project based solely on assurances by its official sponsors about what it can do. This happens long before a prototype has been built or tested, and invariably involves the quoting of unrealistically low unit costs for a sizeable order. Assurances are always given that the system's technical requirements will be simple or have already been met. Low-balling future costs, an intrinsic aspect of front-loading, is an old Defense Department trick, a governmental version of bait-and-switch. (What is introduced as a great bargain regularly turns out to be a grossly expensive lemon.)
                                    </p>

                                    Not only grossly expensive, but due to the engineering, resistant to any&nbsp;effort to pull the plug.&nbsp; But due to the fact that the eventual costs almost always vastly exceed the original budgeted amounts, the shortfall impacts several key aspects of our overall defense posture: our military ends up with fewer of the weapons systems than were initially&nbsp;requested, and&nbsp;there is little or no money left over for necessary additional training, spare parts and repairs - a particularly acute problem given the fact that many of these weapons systems are extremely complex in part, at least, to justify the new expenditure and in part to pump up the overall price tag.
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right:0px">

                                        Front-loading and political engineering generate several typical features in the weapons that the Pentagon then buys for its arsenal. These continually prove unnecessarily expensive, are prone to break down easily, and are often unworkably complex. They tend to come with inadequate supplies of spare parts and ammunition, since there is not enough money to buy the numbers that are needed. They also force the services to repair older weapons and keep them in service much longer than is normal or wise. (For example, the B-52 bomber, which went into service in 1955, is still on active duty.)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Even though extended training would seem to be a necessary corollary of the complexity of such weapons systems, the excessive cost actually leads to reductions in training time for pilots and others. In the long run, it is because of such expedients and short-term fixes that American casualties may increase and, sooner or later, battles or wars may be lost.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For example, Northrop-Grumman's much touted B-2 stealth bomber has proven to be almost totally worthless. It is too delicate to deploy to harsh climates without special hangars first being built to protect it at ridiculous expense; it cannot fulfill any combat missions that older designs were not fully adequate to perform; and -- at a total cost of $44.75 billion for only 21 bombers -- it wastes resources needed for real combat situations.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Instead, in military terms, the most unexpectedly successful post-Vietnam aircraft has been the Fairchild A-10, unflatteringly nicknamed the "Warthog." It is the only close-support aircraft ever developed by the U.S. Air Force. Its task is to loiter over battlefields and assist ground forces in disposing of obstinate or formidable targets, which is not something that fits comfortably with the Air Force's hot-shot self-image.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Some 715 A-10s were produced and they served with great effectiveness in the first Persian Gulf War. All 715 cumulatively cost less than three B-2 bombers. The A-10 is now out of production because the Air Force establishment favors extremely fast aircraft that fly in straight lines at high altitudes rather than aircraft that are useful in battle. In the Afghan war, the Air Force has regularly inflicted heavy casualties on innocent civilians at least in part because it tries to attack ground targets from the air with inappropriately high-performance equipment.
                                    </p>

                                    The net result should be setting off alarms up and down the civilian and military chains of command: our military is forced to&nbsp;utilize out of date weapons systems due to the lack of sufficient numbers of the supposed replacements - as well as the inability to repair same.&nbsp; Weapons systems that are deemed successful in battlefield scenarios are scrapped in favor of more expensive, though far less useful, "improvements."&nbsp; Finally, the reliance on the "advanced" models is,&nbsp;predictably,&nbsp;having a detrimental effect in terms of achieving our objectives in highly sensitive counterinsurgency operations.

                                    The good news is, Robert Gates seems to appreciate the urgency of the situation.&nbsp; The bad news is, of course, that the entrenched bureaucracy will require a herculean effort to tame.&nbsp; But as I've been saying for some time, and as Johnson argues, part of the reason that President Obama chose to stay with Gates at Secretary of Defense is due to Gates' appreciation of this situation:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr" style="margin-right:0px">

                                        President Obama has almost certainly retained Robert M. Gates as Secretary of Defense in part to give himself some bipartisan cover as he tries to come to grips with the bloated defense budget. Gates is also sympathetic to the desire of a few reformers in the Pentagon to dump the Lockheed-Martin F-22 "Raptor" supersonic stealth fighter, a plane designed to meet the Soviet Union's last proposed, but never built, interceptor.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The Air Force's old guard and its allies in Congress are already fighting back aggressively. In June 2008, Gates fired Secretary of the Air Force Michael W. Wynne and Air Force Chief of Staff General T. Michael Moseley. Though he was undoubtedly responding to their fervent support for the F-22, his cover explanation was their visible failure to adequately supervise the accounting and control of nuclear weapons.&nbsp; [...]
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        By the time the prototype F-22 had its roll-out on May 11, 1997, the Cold War was nearly a decade in its grave, and it was perfectly apparent that the Soviet aircraft it was intended to match would never be built. Lockheed Martin, the F-22's prime contractor, naturally argued that we needed it anyway and made plans to sell some 438 airplanes for a total tab of $70 billion. By mid-2008, only 183 F-22s were on order, 122 of which had been delivered. The numbers had been reduced due to cost overruns. The Air Force still wants to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7506601.stm">buy an additional 198 planes</a>, but Secretary Gates and his leading assistants have balked. No wonder. <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jan/28/defense-spending-doesnt-belong-in-stimulus-plan/">According to arms experts</a>Bill Hartung and Christopher Preble, at more than $350 million each, the F-22 is "the most expensive fighter plane ever built."
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The F-22 has several strikingly expensive characteristics which actually limit its usefulness. It is allegedly a stealth fighter -- that is, an airplane with a shape that reduces its visibility on radar -- but there is no such thing as an airplane completely invisible to all radar. In any case, once it turns on its own fire-control radar, which it must do in combat, it becomes fully visible to an enemy.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The F-22 is able to maneuver at very high altitudes, but this is of limited value since there are no other airplanes in service anywhere that can engage in combat at such heights. It can cruise at twice the speed of sound in level flight without the use of its afterburners (which consume fuel at an accelerated rate), but there are no potential adversaries for which these capabilities are relevant. The plane is obviously blindingly irrelevant to "fourth-generation wars" like that with the Taliban in Afghanistan -- the sorts of conflicts for which American strategists inside the Pentagon and out believe the United States should be preparing.
                                    </p>

                                    While proponents of the F-22 and its successors will argue that we need such highly expensive, complex weapons systems to keep us safe, they actually achieve the opposite: their exorbitant price tag ensures that we cannot acquire a sufficient amount forcing us to keep outdated systems in use, while the price tag on even&nbsp;the lesser amount obtained is big enough to crowd out other more practical weapons systems - as well&nbsp;as vital training, repairs and spare parts for the big ticket items themselves.&nbsp; Fixing this&nbsp;broken system&nbsp;is&nbsp;a national security issue.
