                            Oh, man. If only I'd known this 29 years ago MAYBE I'D STILL HAVE AN APPENDIX! GOOD ONE, MODERN MEDICINE!
                        </p>

                                Creationists do not like the idea of vestigial organs, no sir. That their divine creator might have slipped up and stuck in some tissue that is less than perfect is anathema to them, and so we often encounter bitter denunciations of the whole concept of vestigial organs — organs which have a modified or reduced function, and which are largely superfluous. The best example is the human appendix, which can be snipped out and thrown away with the patient no worse for the experience (other than, of course, the general consequences of surgery). You can find many examples of creationists insisting that the appendix really is a an important organ, but I was just pointed to a <a href="http://www.drdino.com/articles.php?spec=75">real doozy at Kent Hovind's site</a>. This one had me laughing out loud before the end.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Start with the title: it is one of a series called "Things that make evolutionists look stupid". This particular article is about the appendix, and it starts out conventionally enough, for a creationist screed.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    For years surgeons removed appendixes with the attitude that they had no function and were no serious loss. It is only fairly recently that it has been realized that the appendix has a number of functions, all of which are important. The appendix is an important part of our immune system. It is a germ free section of the dirtiest part of the body that helps the body produce antibodies and protects the intestinal tract from infection, It also is on the bottom of the only part of the intestinal tract where waste materials must move upward. The appendix performs an important role by creating fluids that force waste matter up this section of the intestines. Without an appendix we become more susceptible to a large number of diseases that are caused by bacteria and viruses, as well as to cancer.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Furthermore, as Ian Taylor has pointed out, many of our alleged ancestors, including monkeys and apes do not have appendixes, while rabbits, wombats and opossums do.
                                </p>

                                "Vestigial" does not mean "functionless". It means that it has become superfluous or reduced. The appendix is loaded with lymphatic and immune system components, but this is unsurprising: such tissues are scattered throughout the digestive system. The question is, why is this patch of lymphatic tissue associated with a little protrusion of the gut? The author's explanations don't work. The idea that it's producing fluids to push the gut contents upward is novel, but ridiculous — it's tiny compared to the volume of the colon, and can't produce that much fluid. If you've ever seen the small intestine, you'd also know that the ascending colon isn't the only part of the tract where contents must flow upwards. It also isn't "germ-free", which is a silly assertion—your gut contains somewhere around 10<sup>14</sup> bacteria. It's a great sloshing tube of culture media for happy microorganisms.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As for the claim that it's vital for health, I've seen a number of studies that look for statistical correlations between appendectomies and cancers, and even some experimental studies in animals where it was removed and outcomes measured against controls…and I'm sorry, I haven't seen any suggestion that it had the effect described. The author would be better off moving to a more nebulous claim. I like the idea that it is the location of the soul, since I had mine removed when I was nine, and a few years later decided I was a godless atheist.
                            </p>

                                I don't know who Ian Taylor is, but he seems willing to make up facts. <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/vestiges/appendix.html">Other primates do have an appendix</a>; <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118493902/abstract">chimpanzees have even been known to develop acute appendicitis</a>. The creationists just keep making stuff up! And need I add that up until now, he's been arguing that the appendix is an essential organ, and now he is (falsely) claiming that other animals don't need it?

                                    but I will relate alternatives to appendectomies that have worked for others without actually advising anyone to follow these procedures. Richard Schulze, the successful naturopathic doctor so hated by the FDA and AMA for being successful, has outlined the way that he has dealt with appendicitis, which I will outline here. Appendix problems are caused by poor diet and severe constipation. The first thing that he recommends is to immediately stop eating and get an enema. A high enema, or high colonic, is very much preferable. A series of regular rectal enemas may have to suffice, if the proper equipment is not available. The enema will relieve the pressure that has built up inside of the appendix. It might even be a good idea to start with a rectal enema and work your way up to a high enema.

                                    Fasting is recommended to be done for a few days, during which time only juice or water should be drunk and some herbal laxatives. An appendix problem is much more serious if there has been a perforation. If there has been an infection caused by a perforated appendix, antibiotic-like herbs should be taken in very heavy doses. Purple coneflower (or echinacea, echinacea purpurea, pallida and angustifolia) and garlic (Allium sativum) are recommended. A light massage of the abdomen would help at this point, but it should only be done with great care, if there is inflammation.

                                    Sandra Ellis describes treating her daughter for appendicitis in which the appendix actually did appear to have ruptured. She followed Jethro Kloss's advice and used a lobelia poultice, which was supplemented by Christopher's formula that added ginger, slippery elm and mullein. She also used comfrey tea and herbal enemas, olive oil and lobelia poultices, chamomile tea, catnip tea, alternating cold and heat packs, and reflexology. Her daughter recovered without an appendectomy, and without any infection. She provides the following formula for a poultice.

                                    Some doctors advise against using any type of laxative and suggest that this may cause a dangerous irritation of the appendix. This may be good advice, but these same doctors fail to suggest releasing pressure through the other end, which would precede the laxative and relieve most of the potential for a "dangerous" irritation.

                                    Once you get over an appendix problem, you must learn from the experience. Your eating habits should change and you should work to ensure that you remain regular. If you eat garbage that acts as intestinal glue, you get what you ask for. Most doctors have acquired the opinion that mutilation is the only option in the case of an appendicitis, and that without them death is inevitable. We can thank the stupidity of evolutionists for this harmful misconception.
