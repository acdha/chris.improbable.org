                            <span>Posted by Mano Marks, Geo <span>APIs</span> team</span>
                            <p>
                                You've probably already <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/02/dive-into-new-google-earth.html">read</a> about this week's release of Google Earth 5.0 and its exciting new features, including Historical Imagery, Touring, Ocean, and Mars. As is usually the case for new features in Earth, we wanted to add representations for some of them to <span>KML</span>. In the past this was done by simply adding new elements to the <span>KML</span> specification. But that's no longer an option for us, since <span>KML</span> is no longer controlled by Google, having been <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/04/kml-html-of-geographic-content.html">released</a> as an open standard by the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">Open <span>Geospatial</span> Consortium</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So what's an application provider to do? Fortunately, both Google and the <span>OGC</span> had the foresight to anticipate that innovation would continue to drive the standard forward, so <span>OGC</span> <span>KML</span> includes a standardized mechanism that enables any group to extend <span>KML</span> within their own XML <span>namespace</span>. Google Earth 5.0 uses this extension mechanism to add to <span>KML</span> in a standards-compliant way. We've also added some new documentation to guide you in understanding these new <span>KML</span> constructs:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>First, something mentioned no where else, Google Earth now supports close to the full range of HTML and JavaScript in the description balloon! This is something that developers have been asking for, and we were able to change the HTML rendering engine to include it. For more details, check out the KML Reference for the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/kmlreference.html#description">description</a> element.
                                </li>
                                <li>We added a new Developer Guide article on <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/">Touring</a>. The <span>KML</span> representation of touring is much more expressive than the simple record button in Google Earth -- <span>KML</span> tour authors have very precise control over the camera, the time slider, and even 3D object animation.
                                </li>
                                <li>We added another Developer Guide article on <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/altitudemode.html"><span>altitudeMode</span></a>, which explains among other things the new ability to place Features below the water surface.
                                </li>
                                <li>We've updated the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/time.html">Time and Animation</a> article to take into account touring and time machine. In particular, <span>KML</span> authors can now control the time slider, both inside and outside of a tour.
                                </li>
                                <li>We updated our <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/kmlreference.html"><span>KML</span> reference</a> to include entries on all the of the new extension elements. The new elements are carefully called out in the documentation as being part of <span>Google's</span> <span>KML</span> extension <span>namespace</span>, to distinguish them from the core <span>OGC</span> <span>KML</span> elements.
                                </li>
                                <li>And finally, we updated <a href="http://code.google.com/p/libkml/"><span>libkml</span></a> to version 0.9. <span>libkml</span> is a powerful open source library for use with applications that want to parse, generate and operate on <span>KML</span>. The new version provides support for the extensions, as well as Update/Delete.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                For those who are interested in precise XML validation of the new elements, please see <span>Google's</span> new <span>KML</span> 2.2 extensions <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/kml/schema/kml22gx.xsd"><span>XSD</span></a>, which is the formal standards-compliant description of their syntax.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As always, you can find out more information or ask questions in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/kml-support"><span>KML</span> Developer Forum</a>.
