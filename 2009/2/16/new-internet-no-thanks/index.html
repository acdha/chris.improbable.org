                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Yesterday's New York Times ran a piece, "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/weekinreview/15markoff.html?_r=1&amp;ref=weekinreview&amp;pagewanted=all">Do We Need a New Internet?</a>" suggesting that the Internet has too many security problems and should therefore be rebuilt.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The piece has been widely criticized in the technical blogosphere, so there's no need for me to pile on. Anyway, I have already written about the redesign-the-Net meme. (See <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/internet-so-crowded-nobody-goes-there-anymore">Internet So Crowded, Nobody Goes There Anymore</a>.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I do want to discuss two widespread misconceptions that found their way into the Times piece.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                First is the notion that today's security problems are caused by weaknesses in the network itself. In fact, the vast majority of our problems occur on, and are caused by weaknesses in, the endpoint devices: computers, mobile phones, and other widgets that connect to the Net. The problem is not that the Net is broken or malfunctioning, it's that the endpoint devices are misbehaving -- so the best solution is to secure the endpoint devices. To borrow an analogy from Gene Spafford, if people are getting mugged at bus stops, the solution is not to buy armored buses.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (Of course, there are some security issues with the network itself, such as vulnerability of routing protocols and DNS. We should work on fixing those. But they aren't the problems people normally complain about -- and they aren't the ones mentioned in the Times piece.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The second misconception is that the founders of the Internet had no plan for protecting against the security attacks we see today. Actually they did have a plan which was simple and, if executed flawlessly, would have been effective. The plan was that endpoint devices would not have remotely exploitable bugs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This plan was plausible, but it turned out to be much harder to execute than the founders could have foreseen. It has become increasingly clear over time that developing complex Net-enabled software without exploitable bugs is well beyond the state of the art. The founders' plan is not working perfectly. Maybe we need a new plan, or maybe we need to execute the original plan better, or maybe we should just muddle through. But let's not forget that there was a plan, and it was reasonable in light of what was known at the time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As I have said before, the Internet is important enough that it's worthwhile having people think about how it might be redesigned, or how it might have been designed differently in the first place. The Net, like any large human-built institution, is far from perfect -- but that doesn't mean that we would be better off tearing it down and starting over.
                            </p>
