                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                I don't watch as much TV as I once did. Yet, I'm still paying Comcast every month, as they're the only provider who will sell me HD service compatible with my TiVo-HD. Sadly, Comcast is far from ideal. I'm regularly frustrated at their inability to debug their signal quality problems. (My ABC-HD and PBS-HD signals are right on the edge, in terms of signal quality, so any slight degradation makes those channels unwatchable through the MPEG block errors, which seems to happen on an irregular basis.) Comcast customer service wants me to sit around all day waiting for a tech to come out when the problem has nothing whatsoever to do with my house. When I've attempted to report the signal strength measurements I've taken and how they vary from channel to channel, I've found I might as well be speaking to a brick wall.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yes, I know I could put an old-school antenna on the roof and feed it into my TiVo. That would do pretty good for the local channels, but then why am I paying Comcast at all? Answer: for the handful of shows that we watch from cable channels. More than one person has asked me why I don't just download these shows online and cut the cable. You can get Comedy Central programming from their web site. You can get all sorts of things from Hulu.com. All free and legal!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To that end, I've hacked my AppleTV with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/atvusb-creator/">latest patchstick</a>, a remarkably painless process, and now my AppleTV, running <a href="http://boxee.tv">Boxee</a>, based on the open-source <a href="http://xbmc.org">xbmc</a> project, can play DVD rips from my file server (including DVD menus), just about anything I download from BitTorrent <em>[see sidebar]</em>, and can get at content from a variety of streaming providers, including Comedy Central and Hulu.com, theoretically covering enough ground that I could legitimately consider dropping the Comcast subscription altogether.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In practice, the Internet TV experience was a let-down. I've got AT&amp;T's "Elite" DSL package ("up to 6Mb", which is pretty close to what I see in practice), so I've got enough bandwidth for streaming. What I actually see is not utilizing that bandwidth. Comedy Central is not giving anywhere near 30 frames per second. It's jumpy, unwatchable. Hulu has moments of greatness (i.e., higher resolution and quality relative to the non-HD channels that Comcast feeds me, but nowhere near broadcast HD) but Hulu also freezes up, sometimes for seconds at a time. If Boxee implemented TiVo-like Season Passes, they could download my shows in advance and yield a real winner of an experience. Or TiVo could implement Hulu support, as they already have batch downloads of Internet video content, mostly from Amazon, albeit with low SD quality and unacceptable self-destructing DRM.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Astute readers will note that I have several other options left to pursue. I could sign up for an unlimited Netflix subscription and have access to their streaming library (either to my TiVo or to my Boxee/AppleTV). I could also "subscribe" to the shows that I care about through Apple's iTunes Store. (That's how I've been watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entourage_(TV_series)">Entourage</a>, since I can't otherwise justify the $20/month that I'd have to pay Comcast for HBO. See also the sidebar.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Netflix doesn't have the current TV shows that I want, and the iTunes store is pretty pricey. Those Entourage episodes are $2 each for 30 minutes of SD quality video. iTunes HD content, when available, is pretty much broadcast HD quality. Good stuff. iTunes SD content looks fine on an iPhone, but has a variety of problems on a proper HD set, most notably that any dark colors are pulled down to 100% black, presumably to improve compression. Very distracting. Regardless, friends I have with Netflix streaming seem to swear by it, and the iTunes Store clearly provides a good experience, albeit with high prices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Clearly, Comcast is in deep trouble. Their product is expensive. Their customer service is lacking. Similar issues can be expected for other cable TV vendors, much less the satellite people. The Internet already has sufficient capacity to deliver the non-broadcast shows that I follow, directly to my TV. All the pieces are in place and they're starting to work well together. The only missing piece is the business model for the future of online TV delivery. Hulu.com, for example, probably thinks they have to require video streaming so they can force you to watch ads. If you could download it, you could skip the ads and there goes their revenue.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I figure the one true hope in all of this is the ever-declining cost of serving up content. At some distant point in the future, the cost of delivering tens of megabits per second of video, for several hours every day, to all of the homes who might want it, will eventually be small enough to not matter any more. Once we get there, the people who make shows can sell them direct to the consumer, insert occasional and targeted ads, and still come out ahead. It could be a long wait.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>[Sidebar: BitTorrent is a brilliant system, from a technical perspective, but it was never designed to provide any anonymity to its users. If you join the torrent for, say, an HBO show, HBO can trivially observe that you (or, at least, your IP address) is there, giving them grounds to go after you in one form or another. From that perspective, you'd have to be insane to download a mainstream movie or TV show from BitTorrent, or you'd have to do something terribly anti-social, like tunnel your entire BitTorrent session through Tor, which <a href="http://www.chrisbrunner.com/?p=119">Tor was never designed to handle</a>, although there are several <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/two-incentive-designs-tor">designs to improve Tor</a> or <a href="http://systems.cs.colorado.edu/~bauerk/papers/alpaca2008.pdf">anonymize BitTorrent</a>. So then, what shows do I feel safe to download via BitTorrent? So far, only the latest episodes of the BBC's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gear_(current_format)">Top Gear</a>. They air in the U.K. six months to a year ahead of their appearance on BBC America and availability on the U.S. iTunes Store. If there were a way to get these shows in the U.S. simultaneous with their British release, I'd happily pay for the privilege, even the $2 rate at the iTunes Store, but I'm not given that option at any price.]</em>
