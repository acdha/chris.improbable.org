Recent studies have found that arbitrators rule against consumers between <a href="http://www.citizen.org/pressroom/release.cfm?ID=2519">94</a>-<a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0716/p13s01-wmgn.htm">96</a>% of the time. Even if an arbitrator rules in your favor, there's no guarantee that the damages will even cover the cost of arbitration, much less the injury itself. In <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/business/yourmoney/06gret.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business">one case</a>, a consumer sued her brokerage firm after it lost over $280,000 of her money. The arbitration panel ruled in the consumer's favor, awarded her $5,000, and charged her $10,000 in fees.

                                            Exactly. The problem with mandatory binding arbitration agreements, as you've probably noticed from this terrible choose your own adventure, is that there's no choice. You're forced to use a sham proceeding that has no real procedural or judicial protections.

                                            The point that we're making isn't that lawsuits solve everything, or even that all arbitration is bad. What we're attacking are contracts that require you upfront to agree to binding arbitration. If a problem arises and both parties want to arbitrate, that's fine. Even a contract that requires arbitration, but allows litigation if the result is unsatisfactory, is acceptable. The essential component is the choice to arbitrate, or not arbitrate.
