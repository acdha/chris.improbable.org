                            It took me awhile to realize that this list really was from real Republicans and not the Daily Show writers.

                                    <em>by publius</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We’re all about bipartisan understanding here at ObWi – so I wanted to find a good thought-provoking critique from someone who feels the stimulus bill is full of waste.&nbsp; I needed a different perspective.&nbsp; So I checked out the Corner and <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YmM3MGUwNDlmZDNhYmNmNDRhNWI4ZjY0NTQ1YWFjNjY=">K-Lo obliged</a>.&nbsp; To illustrate the stimulus bill’s “wasteful spending,” K-Lo dutifully linked to <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjcyODIyZGM2MGU1ZDdkNDgxZDc3OTNjYjM4ZDY1ODI=">this longer NRO article</a>, which meticulously outlined 50 “of the most outrageous items in the stimulus package” (generally deemed outrages because they don’t stimulate).&nbsp; I decided to check this list out and report back to you, fair reader.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    First outrageous item on the list – the bill provides $50 million for the National Endowment of the Arts, <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjcyODIyZGM2MGU1ZDdkNDgxZDc3OTNjYjM4ZDY1ODI=">so that</a> the “unemployed can fill their days attending abstract-film festivals and sitar concerts.”&nbsp; That’s really funny.&nbsp; And you know who else would find it <em>really</em> funny?&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/02/arts_bashing.html">5 million or so Americans</a> who work in the arts industry (including in support roles as, say, janitors).&nbsp; The people <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2009/01/la-opera-announ.html">laid off by the Los Angeles Opera</a> last month would also find it especially hilarious.&nbsp; After all, if there’s any one product that should be left entirely to market whims, it’s art.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Moving on to the next “outrageous” item on our list…&nbsp; $380 million for the “Women, Infants, and Children” Program.&nbsp; Certainly sounds wasteful to me.&nbsp; When I first read this part, I remember thinking, “could they be talking about the ‘WIC’ program?”&nbsp; But I quickly dismissed the thought.&nbsp; The WIC program is about giving money to poor parents <em>to buy food for kids</em>.&nbsp; It’s like the posterchild for stimulus.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Well, as it turns out, the first letters of “W”oman, “I”nfants, and “C”hildren do in fact spell WIC.&nbsp; And that’s exactly the program they were talking about.&nbsp; Surely we can all agree that there is nothing more outrageous and non-stimulative than giving money to poor parents to buy food for children.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Next up -- $300 million for “grants to combat violence against women.”&nbsp; Another outrage.&nbsp; And very non-stimulative – after all, <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/38273654.html">new hiring by violence programs</a> and <a href="http://www.nnedv.org/policy/takeaction/45-policy-making/226-call-your-senators-about-the-economic-stimulus-bill.html">transitional housing</a> are not the kind of things that will pump money back into the economy.&nbsp; And besides, protecting violence against women isn’t a top priority now that we have <em>Heller</em> – they can just arm themselves.&nbsp; See how easy downward adjustments are?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Moving on -- $2 billion for “child-care block grants.”&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; I mean, <em>really</em>?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Next up -- $6 billion for university building projects.&nbsp; Yep, doesn’t get much less stimulative than that.&nbsp; This one seemed so absurd that I actually scrolled back up to see what they had written about it – “Perhaps spending $6 billion on university building projects will put some unemployed construction workers to work.”&nbsp; That’s no reason, though, to remove it from the List of 50 Outrages.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Next -- $15 billion for Pell Grants.&nbsp; At the outset, let me note that the goal of helping poor people go to college is a questionable one.&nbsp; It’s sort of outrageous actually that government would step on the market’s toes in this way.&nbsp; But even putting aside their general terribleness, Pell Grants also have <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2009/02/02/nelson-pell-grants/">significant stimulative benefits</a> for universities and their local economies.&nbsp; Schools, after all, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/08/AR2008100801587.html">are experiencing cuts</a> – and tuition and book payments would help.&nbsp; Not to mention that Pell Grants, you know, help poor people go to college.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The rest of the article is pretty much cut from the same cloth – though it’s divided into various sections.&nbsp; All the nutty provisions listed above – food for infants; education grants for poor people – are under the section entitled “Various Left-Wingery.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The next section, though, is entitled “Poorly Designed Tax Relief.”&nbsp; In short, the section argues that taxes don’t give rich people enough money.&nbsp; And I agree with that.&nbsp; If the past 5 years have taught us anything, it’s that rich people need more money.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Next section – “Stimulus for the Government.”&nbsp; The gist here is that spending billions of dollars to renovate, improve, and construct facilities for federal agencies is outrageous.&nbsp; This line, though, was my personal favorite from that section:
                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-left:40px">
                                    For instance, the bill grants NASA $450 million, but it states that the agency must spend at least $200 million on “climate-research missions,” which raises the question: Is there global warming in space?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ha, good one.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Next’er’roo – and, frankly, the most persuasive section of all – “Income Transfers.”&nbsp; The specific critiques here focus on the (1) $89 billion for Medicaid (because who works in the health profession these days, really?); (2) $30 billion for COBRA extension; (3) $36 billion for expanded unemployment benefits; and (4) $20 billion for food stamps.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Truly, our search for outrages has hit pay dirt.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.epi.org/economic_snapshots/entry/webfeatures_snapshots_20081022/">Study after study</a> has shown that food stamp and unemployment spending are among the least effective ways to stimulate the economy.&nbsp; Plus, the goals themselves – you know, feeding people – are substantively questionable.&nbsp; Outrage!&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And the winner for “Best Quote” in the Income Transfers section goes to:
                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-left:40px">
                                    As for extending unemployment benefits through the downturn, it might be a good idea for other reasons, but it wouldn’t stimulate economic growth: It would provide an incentive for job-seekers to delay reentry into the workforce.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I’m sure the people of Elkhart, Indiana might have a few thoughtful comments on that bit.&nbsp; They should take this show on the road.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I give up – you get the point.&nbsp; These authors took the time to find the 50 “most outrageous” items and this is the best they could do. <em>All</em> of the items noted above made the list of outrages.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This article captures the essence of the past two weeks’ debate better than anything else I’ve seen.&nbsp; Well done boys.&nbsp;
