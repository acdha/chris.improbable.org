                                    <em>by von</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I realized the other day that I'm about as gay-friendly a Republican* they come -- without, y'know, actually screwing other guys.  (<em>But the night is young! one might respond ....</em>)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Anyhoo. Why not burnish my gay rights cred and criticize the Democrats at the same time? 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There is absolutely no need for President Obama to take a "<a href="http://media.www.thespartandaily.com/media/storage/paper852/news/2009/02/09/Opinion/A.Fresh.Perspective.On.The.dont.Ask.Dont.Tell.Law-3619279.shtml">fresh perspective</a>" on Don't Ask, Don't Tell.  It's been sixteen years since the policy was implemented.  The policy has been adequately perspectived.  Unless you like your army Arabic-linguist-free (or, at least, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14052513/">reduced</a>), it ain't working. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And, yes, that last link goes to story more than two years old.  That's the point:  Fresh this issue ain't.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So here's my counter-proposal:  Unless your sex life gets in the way of your job, you're OK.  That isn't exactly the as being tolerant towards all and everything.  The army isn't Vegas. There's no need to be tolerant towards anyone who can't understand so-called time, place, and manner restrictions -- formerly known as common sense -- whether they're gay, bi, trans, straight, or undecided.  If you're signing up to bang a bunch of Iraqi chicks, lead the first gay pride parade in Baghdad, or slut your way through the Iraqi Army (note the full-on gendercore:it's what we Gen-Xers call irony**), let me be the first to punch your dishonorable discharge home.  That ain't your job.  But if you can do your job and maintain a sex life with a gender of your choosing -- what 99.94% of people call "life" -- then you can serve.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Carry on.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    *Full disclosure:  I'm actually a really bad Republican, and always have been. But I'm a worse Democrat and a terrible Libertarian, so there you are.  Process of elimination.  (And I actually believe a bunch of legal mumbo-jumbo about how marriage shouldn't be redefined through the courts to include gays; I prefer the legislative route, which is the conservative pro-gay marriage position to the extent there is such a thing.) 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    **In other words, it's a joke.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>UPDATE: </strong> A lot of folks dispute the parenthetical in the first footnote.  That's OK:  I expected most of our left-leaning commentators to be mostly OK with everything <em>but</em> that footnote, so I'm kinda baiting y'all.  (I mean, erm, stimulating conversation.)  But a few points of clarification - 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    1.  I'm only talking about the US Constitution.  I don't know anything about the Constitutions of other states.  2. I certainly don't think that the US Constitution forbids gay marriage - I just don't see an affirmative Consitutional right to require states that define marriage as between a man and a women to change that definition to include marriages between individuals of the same sex.  3.  I don't find the comparisons to the Civil Rights Movement or the <em>Loving</em> case apt.  The 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the US Constitution directly address those issues.  There is no Amendment or Constitutional provision that addresses the question of whether gay folks should be permitted to marry in contravention of state or federal law.  4.  There is a difference between law and justice: or, put another way, nearly every law carries with it the potential for injustice as applied.  This is the price for living by the rule of law.  You can't always do what you think is right.  That sucks, until you consider the alternatives.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    By the way, it is <em><strong>because</strong></em> I think that gay marriage will ultimately depend on the people that I hold President Obama to a higher standard regarding "don't ask don't tell."  President Obama has it within his power to correct this injustice.  Moreover, when justice <em><strong>is</strong></em> done by eliminating DADT, and no horribles thereafter parade, it is likely that <strong><em>more</em></strong> folks will agree with my views on gay marriage.
