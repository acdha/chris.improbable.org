                                </p>

                                    A few thoughts on this:<span> </span> First, what really bothers me is that many rank-and-file conservatives fail to acknowledge that their policy preferences lead – in the real world – to massive wealth consolidation.<span> </span> It’s all fine and good to say people spend their money best, and regulations are harmful – in many instances, I fully agree.
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS">
                                    But we can’t pretend that millionaires are in the same position as people who make $50,000.<span> </span> They’re not.<span> </span> There are of course different ways to write a tax cut -- and different groups to target.  But by some weird coincidence, the GOP's preferred tax cuts always seem to concentrate wealth for the uber-rich.  (If you want to cut payroll taxes for poor people, well buddy, that's just a tax cut <em>too far</em>).<span> </span> I suppose this sounds harsh, but much of the GOP’s tax policies are simply a mirage – wealth redistribution to the very top cloaked in populist language.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The first problem then is that even well-meaning conservatives aren’t acknowledging the reality their economic policies create.
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS">
                                    Others, however, are fully aware of the consequences and honestly think that wealth concentration is a good thing – either as a matter of fairness, or because of some “trickle down” theory.<span> </span> I can’t really speak to fairness, though it's hard to call any policy "fair" that allows 1% of the population to keep 20% of the wealth while poorer people go without health care and decent schools.
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS">
                                    But what’s infuriating is how poorly the trickle down theories have performed <em>in practice</em>.<span> </span> It's not like this is an abstract debate.  We’ve seen what happens when we consolidate wealth – and it’s not good.<span> </span> Overall demand drops.<span> </span> The rich blow their money on stupid, externality-creating Ponzi schemes.<span> <br></span>
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS">
                                    That's why it's better to try trickle-UP theories, where the money being hoarded at the top is instead used to lift wages, make investments, and help the country as a whole.
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS">
                                    In short, it’s just hard to take any of the GOP tax and spending positions seriously as a policy matter – though we <em>have</em> to take them seriously as a political matter because they've become accepted dogma among the institutional GOP players and their media arms.<span> </span>
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS"></p>
                                <p>
                                    I mean, here we are -- quite literally standing on the brink of economic catastrophe -- and all they can push for is more tax cuts for rich people.  And God forbid we build things the public needs rather than taking that money and giving it to Wall Street.<span> </span> It doesn’t matter <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2009/02/mitchs_millions.php">how many millions</a> are unemployed, or how wretched our infrastructure has become, the real problem in America is that rich people don’t have enough money.
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS">
                                    The Democrats need to get louder about what is happening -- and about where the GOP priorities are in the stimulus debate.<span> </span> Whether conservatives intend it or not (some do, some don’t), the Republicans are fighting to redistribute more money to the very rich – it’s as if the last 5 years never happened.<span> <br></span>
                                </p>
                                <p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS">
                                    And it’s all they ever fight for – and, in practice – it’s all they really care about.
                                </p>
