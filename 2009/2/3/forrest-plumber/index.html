                                        Fresh off his stint as a war correspondent in Gaza, Joe the Plumber is now doing political strategy with Republicans.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        When GOP congressional aides gather Tuesday morning for a meeting of the Conservative Working Group, Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher – more commonly known as Joe the Plumber — will be their featured guest. This group is an organization of conservative Capitol Hill staffers who meet regularly to chart GOP strategy for the week.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Wurzelbacher, who became a household name during the presidential election, will be focusing his talk on the proposed stimulus package. He’s apparently not a fan of the economic rescue package, according to members of the group.
                                    </p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    I think it’s nice that the GOP has found its new BFF with Joe the Plumber, but if memory serves correctly, every time Mr. Wurzelbacher opens his mouth on the issues of the day, ignorance vomits forth in rushing gouts. I believe the GOP is packaging this as “wisdom from the heartland,” but speaking as one in the heartland, dude, it’s just ignorance. And what’s not ignorance is a GOP talking point, so I expect from the GOP point of view, whatever Joe says is going to be pure gold. <em>He makes so much sense! He’s saying things we’ve always believed!</em> Well, yes.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This is not to disparage Mr. Wurzelbacher for being an opportunist, incidentally, and if you are of a mind to, here’s a quiz for you:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Hey, you’re a bald, chunky, blue-collar nobody from a crappy little midwest town! By chance, you find yourself thrust into the national spotlight and have a chance to do something more interesting with your life than sit in your crappy little midwest town and get balder and chunkier. Do you:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>a)</strong> Say, “no thanks, I’d rather stay a nobody”;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>b)</strong> Do all the wacky crap everybody asks you to do for as long as you possibly can, because in your heart you know it will never ever get any better than this for you for as long as you might possibly live.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Take your time on that one, people.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So, no: I don’t blame Joe the Plumber one bit for taking up the invitation to talk strategy with the GOP, or fly to the mideast, or any other thing he might be offered to do that sounds interesting to him. Dude’s living the dream, man. As long as they keep letting him, why shouldn’t he. I support Wurzelbacher milking this thing. Good for him. I hope he’s having fun. I suspect he is.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The real question is not what Joe’s doing, but what the hell the GOP’s <em>thinking</em>. Maybe they haven’t been keeping up with current events, but the last guy who hitched his wagon to Joe the Plumber found that wagon in the ditch. Joe the Plumber is an everyman, perhaps, but he’s the sort of everyman who got outvoted by all the <em>other</em> sorts of everymen out there, and <a href="http://whatever.scalzi.com/2008/11/11/another-county-heard-from/">whose numbers appear to be shrinking as time goes on</a> in any event. Which is to say that it’s good for Joe the Plumber that the GOP wants to hear from him; it’s probably not so great for the GOP.
