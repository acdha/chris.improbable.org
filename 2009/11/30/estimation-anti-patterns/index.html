                                A symptom of a pressured team, this method of estimating allows a pair of developers to get the story out of their stream as quickly as possible by eliminating time spent on tedious things like refactoring to make the code maintainable, deployment, manual testing, etc. Symptoms include the oft-quoted <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000818.html">“Works on my machine.”</a>

                            <p>
                                A good team knows, of course, that the code counts for nothing until it’s out there in production, doing the thing it was built to do. Estimates are given with this in mind, but without the help of anyone involved in production deployment, systems integration, performance testing, UAT, etc., because they’re in <em>different teams</em>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                After the scope of the project has been constructed, some stories may be considered too large to fit into an iteration, so the team decide to split them into the smallest possible deliverable slices, re-estimating each slice. Of course, this is a bit like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Long_Is_the_Coast_of_Britain%3F_Statistical_Self-Similarity_and_Fractional_Dimension">measuring the coast of Britain</a>. The epic which was 13 points at project inception becomes 16 points of features, and 23 points of stories by the time it’s done in the sprints. Analysts wonder where this extra scope came from, while advocates of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn_down_chart">burn-down charts</a> tuck the growing scope away somewhere where it won’t be noticed.

                                Like Scrum’s sprint commitments, but used for release or project planning, this estimation method often leads to three-week long project planning meetings before the project starts.

                                Once a target velocity has been established – sometimes by the team itself – the team members will find a reason as to why the work they’re capable of doing does actually add up to 12 story points. Often applied in conjunction with Fractal Estimation.
