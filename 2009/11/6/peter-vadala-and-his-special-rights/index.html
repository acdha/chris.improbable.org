                            <p>
                                An employee at a Brookstone store was fired after telling a co-worker it’s wrong to be a Jew. A manager from another branch kept talking about her upcoming Jewish holiday. Finally, the Christian employee wanted her to stop pushing her anti-Christian agenda and told her, “Regarding Judaism, I believe that’s bad stuff.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And Brookstone fired him! They claim to have a zero-tolerance policy on discriminatory harassment. All right-thinking people are outraged over this persecution of Christians.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well, maybe I don’t have that <em>quite</em> right.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Peter Vadala, at Brookstone’s Logan Airport store, was fired after telling a co-worker it’s wrong to be gay. A manager from another branch kept mentioning her female fiance. Finally Vadala, based on his Christian beliefs, wanted her to stop talking about her “so-called fiance,” and told her, “Regarding homosexuality, I believe that’s bad stuff.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Brookstone investigated, took Vadala’s statement, and then fired him, citing their zero-tolerance policy on discriminatory harassment. And of course, the Christian Right is frothing over this persecution of Christians.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Watch:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <iframe allowfullscreen="" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BWxOKOcf3zQ%26hl%3Den%26fs%3D1%26" width="560" height="340"></iframe>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Vadala wasn’t fired for his Christian beliefs. He was fired because he directly insulted a colleague, and because Brookstone hires its staff with the understanding that they won’t go around condemning each other’s religion, gender, sexual orientation, or race.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And, for the record, Brookstone would be right to fire someone who said to Vadala on the job, “Your Christianity? I believe that’s bad stuff.” Because Brookstone’s employees have promised to not to do that sort of thing as a condition of their employment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the irony! Vadala is fine with talk of opposite-sex fiances, but at 2:15 into the clip, he says:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    I was going to explain that I prefer she didn’t bring [homosexuality] up in the workplace, because I don’t believe that controversial issues like that have any place in the workplace at all.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Vadala wants one rule for what straights can say about their families, and a different, more restrictive rule for gays. Do you see the irony? <strong><em>He’s complaining about being punished for expressing his beliefs at work, AND he’s saying gays shouldn’t be allowed to talk about their families at work.</em></strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Peter Vadala. You’ll be hearing that name a lot. He’s not asking for freedom of speech. He’s asking for special rights.
                            </p>
