                            <p>
                                This is the first in a series of articles in which I'll document my move away from Python and the adventures encountered in using <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a> to build the <a href="http://www.espians.com/plexnet.html">Plexnet</a>, an “internet operating system”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My love affair with Python began in early 2000 when I <a href="http://zwiki.org/Tav">discovered Zwiki</a>. And despite brief flings with other languages — Alice, E, Erlang, Lisp, Lua, Objective-C, OCaml, Oz, PowerShell, Ruby, Scheme, Smalltalk — I've always returned to the sexiness of Python and the ubiquity of Javascript.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, in recent times, I've found Python sadly lacking on a number of fronts, e.g.
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Abysmal multi-core support.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html">multiprocessing</a> module is a joke and if it were not for the <a href="http://damienkatz.net/2008/03/what_sucks_abou.html">ugly Prolog-inspired syntax</a>, I'd have switched to Erlang long ago.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Fragmented networking support.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a> is great, but forces you into callback hell. <a href="http://eventlet.net/">Eventlet</a> and friends make good use of <a href="http://codespeak.net/py/0.9.2/greenlet.html">greenlets</a> but still can't make use of those spare cores on my servers — <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Spawning">Spawning</a> helps though. The kqueue/epoll support in the standard library were, until relatively recently, <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue5910">broken</a> or non-existent. At least <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyev/">pyev</a> is cool, but there aren't any decent frameworks built on it!
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                        <strong>Difficult to secure.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Want to build your own App Engine like service? Good luck securing Python! It's possible, but we, the open source community, have yet to deliver. Mark Seaborn has done some great work getting <a href="http://lackingrhoticity.blogspot.com/2009/06/python-standard-library-in-native.html">Python onto Native Client</a> but you'd still need to port all your C Extensions over. PyPy has a great <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/sandbox.html">sandbox</a>, but you can't use newer Python features nor those C Extensions and, to boot, the networking support sucks.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Painful to optimise.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Until <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/trunk/pypy/doc/jit/overview.html">PyPy's JIT</a> or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/unladen-swallow/">Unladen Swallow</a> lands, the main way to optimise that slow running Python function is to write C extensions. This is a pain filled process. <a href="http://www.cython.org/">Cython</a> definitely makes it easier, but you then have to deal with figuring out the limitations of Cython's syntax!
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                Now, until last week, I'd just put up with all the problems and waited for <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/">PyPy</a> to mature. And when <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> — the shiny, new programming language from Google — came along, I took a brief look and then dismissed it forthwith.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sure, it looked like a nice programming language. And, sure, the guys behind it had made some of the biggest contributions to computing to date, including: UNIX, regular expressions, Plan 9 and even UTF-8! But I still didn't see the point in switching to Go as my primary language.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But then, a few days ago, whilst reading this <a href="http://www.xent.com/pipermail/fork/Week-of-Mon-20091109/054578.html">wonderful rant</a> by Jeff Bone on the poor state of today's programming languages, <a href="http://twitter.com/evangineer">@evangineer</a> pointed out that Go had rudimentary support for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/">Native Client</a>!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And within 24 hours, I was a Go convert. Now don't get me wrong, Python and I will always be good friends, but there's just no competing with Go. Why?
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Native Client (NaCl) support.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/">NaCl</a>, like its distant cousin <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~baford/vm/">Vx32</a>, allows one to safely execute untrusted “native code”, e.g. C code. It's one of the coolest open source projects to come out of Google!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The most interesting application of such technology is of course as a way to allow for dynamic loading of browser extensions, e.g. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/wiki/NativeClientInGoogleChrome">Native Client in Google Chrome</a>. This is useful 'cos, despite the crazy speeds of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a>, you really don't want to be writing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">metaverse</a> in Javascript!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now, for those of you who might think that this is a return to to the world of crap that was ActiveX and Java applets, I'll explain later how NaCl can be very much in the spirit of the Open Web. However, first let me explain why we shouldn't necessarily be too enamoured with Javascript:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                <strong>Javascript has no security model.</strong> If you were to do a client-side mashup between say your banking application and a photo application, there is nothing stopping the photo app from having fun with your financial data.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/">Caja</a> is definitely amazing work in this regard, but requires apps to run within containers which most aren't geared to do — not to mention the performance hit. <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/drafts/tc39-2009-050.pdf">ES5</a> will make life a little better in this regard, but that's still a while off…
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <p>
                                                <strong>Javascript has no decent concurrency model.</strong> Single-threaded execution was fine when all we were doing were image replacements on mouseover, but today's web apps could really do with some form of concurrency model.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                The best we could seemingly come up with is the piece of crap that are <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/workers/">Web Workers</a> in HTML5. And <a href="http://www.flapjax-lang.org/">Flapjax</a>, while it manages to bring functional reactivity to the browser, sadly ignores the whole issue of security.
                                            </p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        So it was in this context that we (Espians) worked on things like the <a href="http://github.com/tav/plexnet/tree/master/source/client/webkit_bridge/">webkit_bridge</a> — to act as an interface between the browser's DOM and a PyPy-based interpreter providing a safe, concurrent, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model">object-capability</a> based language called λscript.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But, as my friend Ade would say, Go + NaCl offers a more attractive path of least resistance! Google are already putting resources behind Chrome, Go and NaCl — there's no real reason (technical or otherwise) to duplicate the work! All we need to do is focus on implementing λscript using Go!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        And since people could create apps and services using Go itself, λscript can be a very minimal layer between the various NaCl processes — even less work! Now as to how this could be done in the spirit of the Open Web, consider this:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>NaCl binaries are bloated beasts. It makes sense instead to come up with a source based packaging structure similar to ebuilds/setuptools/&amp;c. for apps and services — these can then be compiled by the client thanks to the super-fast compilation feature of Go! So we can have “view source” <em>and</em> secure apps!
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        Now, we are still a while away from the any of this happening and the NaCl support within Go <a href="http://github.com/tav/go/tree/master/src/pkg/exp/nacl/">is</a> <a href="http://github.com/tav/go/blob/master/src/pkg/syscall/asm_nacl_386.s">very</a> <a href="http://github.com/tav/go/blob/master/src/all-nacl.bash">experimental</a>, but I'm sure it'll improve in time — especially given the following point.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Google backing.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Corporate sponsorship tend to make projects worse off — but with the various Chrome, NaCl and Go projects, Google have really put together great teams and resourced them well. And there are lots of Google fanboys who will happily contribute their time to such projects too — making them even better!
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Go is a decent language.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Despite seemingly having ignored most of the advances in computer science in the last 20 years, Go is surprisingly a fun language to code in. The standard library packages are an impressive start. And you can definitely feel the influence of Python.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        However, runtime performance is an issue for the moment — there are enough micro-benchmarks showing Python to be more performant in certain contexts. This will change though, as:
                                    </p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>The packages in the standard library are worked on. There are a lot of low hanging optimisations to make here. A <a href="http://github.com/tav/go/commit/5e0e8e35d5df2533fc7beff9feecbe56333c164e">recent commit</a> improved the regexp package by a factor of 3-20x!
                                        </li>
                                        <li>The compilers are worked on. Right now, <tt>gccgo</tt> is more performant at runtime but lacks various features, whilst the <tt>6g</tt> series has more features and compiles faster. At some point, the various compilers will meet in some form, yielding more performant code all round.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>The new garbage collector is worked on. The current one is rather naive but as I understand it, they already have a much more performant one in the works.
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>
                                        The syntax makes a pleasant compromise between C and Python. The documentation system is excellent — and the testing framework shows promise. The only thing I miss in this regard is having some equivalent to <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/doctest.html">doctest</a> — this should be possible once <tt>pkg/exp/eval</tt> for the Go interpreter matures though.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Of course, goroutines rock! Who can say no to a typed-variant of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_calculus">π-calculus</a>? Not to mention being able to write code like <tt>go fuck_yourself()</tt> ;p
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        But the real fun is with the interfaces — Python's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">duck-typing</a> brought to a statically typed language! Who'd have thought? It really is quite brilliant — at least it will be once a few decent patterns emerge and are adopted. Until then I expect people to do all kinds of crazy things with them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The only thing I (and seemingly a lot of others) really miss is having first class containers which can handle generic data types like with Python's <tt>list</tt>, <tt>dict</tt>, &amp;c. This is possible in Go right now, but you have to unbox them everytime which I'd rather not be doing…
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I've also seen a lot of people complain about the lack of exception handling in Go. I'm not sure what those people are talking about. Go has excellent exception handling. The “comma, ok” pattern is elegant enough and the <tt>defer</tt> statement provides a very good equivalent to the usual <tt>try/finally</tt> and some of the <tt>with</tt> patterns in Python.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                In any case, I hope I make a reasonable case for why moving to Go might be worthwhile. Over the coming weeks, I'll continue this by documenting my adventures in the land of Go.
                            </p>
