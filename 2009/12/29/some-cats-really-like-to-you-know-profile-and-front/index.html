                                    The overwhelming consensus amongst counterterrorism scholars, experts and practitioners is that intelligence and law enforcement are the most effective tools available in terms of implementing effective counterterrorism policy, and, thus, these options should be relied on primarily.  Not only does the military approach and attendant "war" rhetoric play to the advantage of transnational, stateless terror groups like al-Qaeda, but so too does that approach feed the overinflated, romantic sense of importance that is so appealing to potential recruits and members. As the <a href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9351/index1.html">RAND Corporation</a> put it rather succinctly in a 2008 report, the US should optimize its approach by:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Mak[ing] policing and intelligence the backbone of U.S. efforts. Al Qa'ida consists of a network of individuals who need to be tracked and arrested. This requires careful involvement of the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as their cooperation with foreign police and intelligence agencies.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Minimiz[ing] the use of U.S. military force. In most operations against al Qa'ida, local military forces frequently have more legitimacy to operate and a better understanding of the operating environment than U.S. forces have. This means a light U.S. military footprint or none at all.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                        Key to this strategy is replacing the war-on-terrorism orientation with the kind of counterterrorism approach that is employed by most governments facing significant terrorist threats today. Calling the efforts a war on terrorism raises public expectations — both in the United States and elsewhere — that there is a battlefield solution. It also tends to legitimize the terrorists' view that they are conducting a jihad (holy war) against the United States and elevates them to the status of holy warriors. Terrorists should be perceived as criminals, not holy warriors.
                                    </p>

                                    The good news is that the United States has a natural advantage in the law enforcement/intelligence arena: moreso than in European nations struggling with Islam-perverting terrorism, the Muslim community in the United States tends to feel more accepted, less alienated and less persecuted.  This assimilating melting pot effect has helped to establish a human trip wire within the Muslim community, with numerous plots weeded out and interdicted by American Muslims themselves, working in close concert with law enforcement and intelligence personnel.
                                </p>

                                    However, that is not an immutable dynamic.  Wajahat Ali had a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/dec/16/virginia-extremism-radicalisation">solid piece</a> discussing some of the positive and negative trends regarding these issues recently:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">

                                        The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/10/missing-americans-held-pakistan-jihad" title="Guardian: Arrested Americans came to Pakistan for jihad, say police">arrest of five American Muslims in Pakistan</a> allegedly conspiring to join the terrorist groups <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/jaysh-muhammad.htm">Jaysh Muhammad</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3181925.stm">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> exposes a troubling phenomenon of domestic radicalisation, but also highlights an evolved, proactive Muslim American community seeking partnership to curb extremism. [...]
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        These isolated examples of imported radicalism nonetheless fuel the latent prejudices of a minority convinced their 4 million Muslim American neighbours represent a treacherous fifth column of stealth jihadists ready to spontaneously ignite...
                                    </p>

                                        This misperception certainly is not assuaged by prominent religious and political figures, mostly stemming from the Republican party, who espouse divisive rhetoric fostering mistrust and fear. <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cair-franklin-graham-repeats-attack-on-islam-79097332.html">Franklin Graham, an influential evangelical Christian, recently stated on CNN</a>: "We have many Muslims that live in this country. But true Islam cannot be practised in this country...I don't agree with the teachings of Islam and I find it to be a very violent religion." Sarah Palin casually suggested we "<a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2009/11/palin_on_nidal_hasan_profile_a_1.asp">profile away</a>" when it comes to our American neighbours of Muslim and Middle Eastern backgrounds.

                                    <p>
                                        This polarisation and the reckless mentality of treating Muslims as suspects instead of partners not only subverts civil rights and due process but greatly hinders the best opportunity to combat domestic radicalisation: respectful co-operation with the Muslim American community.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As an example, the Virginia Muslim community's private and public response to the arrest of five of their young people marks a decisive change of proactive engagement with law enforcement resulting from mutual trust and open communication. Upon discovering a video left behind by the alleged leader of the group declaring his plans to fight on behalf of Muslims, his parents consulted with the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) who reported the disappearance of the young men to the FBI. Ironically, the FBI as of last April refused to view Cair, the most influential Muslim American advocacy group, as an "<a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/1109/Despite_ban_Holder_to_speak_to_CAIRlinked_group.html">appropriate liaison partner</a>" due to unfounded and baseless allegations connecting its executives to Hamas.

                                    <p>
                                        In addition, the Muslim Public Affairs Committee recently <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2009/1211/US-Muslim-group-Muslims-must-rally-to-counter-radicalization">issued a proposal</a> for law enforcement officials and Muslim Americans to use their respective resources and strengths to unite in combating terrorism. However, they stressed an important caveat: "Unfortunately, in the current political climate, the actions of certain law enforcement agencies – whether spying on peaceful activist groups and houses of worship without reasonable suspicion, or religious profiling – have added to difficulties."

                                        Of course, we also don't get to interrogate him to find out who he was working with and what other plots are out there. If he were treated as an enemy combatant and transferred to military commission system, we could use Army Field Manual techniques without Miranda (not as effective as enhanced techniques, of course, but much better than standard police practice). We could use his non-Mirandized statements against him in military commissions, so long as the statements were not forcibly coerced and were otherwise reliable. Instead, it's three squares a day, the best legal defense the ACLU can provide, and maybe the chance for parole before the kids he was trying to kill on that plane even make it out of college.

                                    One can safely assume that, contra Goldfarb, Abdulmutallab will face a conviction and lengthy prison sentence, even without self-incriminating statements derived via torture and/or interrogation by military personnel.  Here's another egregious <a href="http://michiganmessenger.com/32469/rep-miller-try-abdulmutallab-in-military-court">example</a> of pining for torture/military interrogation:

                                        Do they think that if he’s not under military control, he’s not being interrogated? The FBI has been interrogating him from the moment he was arrested and all indications are that he has been cooperative and has already revealed his connections to Al Qaeda, where he got the bombmaking materials and so forth.

                                    But this gets it exactly wrong in at least two ways.  First, we want to downplay the importance of terror suspects, not hype them up.  As <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/14036.html">Marc Sageman</a> noted:
                                </p>

                                        The United States underestimates the value of prosecutions, which often can be enormously demoralizing to radical groups. There is no glory in being taken to prison in handcuffs. No jihadi Web site publishes such pictures. Arrested terrorists fade into oblivion. Only martyrs live on in popular memory.
                                    </p>
