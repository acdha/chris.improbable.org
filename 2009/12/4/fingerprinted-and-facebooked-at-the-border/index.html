                        <blockquote>
                            According to the Wall St Journal, "<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125978649644673331.html">Iranian Crackdown Goes Global</a> ," Iran is monitoring Facebook, and in a move reminiscent of the Soviets, arresting people whose relatives criticize the regime online.
                            <p>
                                That trend is part of a disturbing tendency to criminalize thoughts, intents, and violations of social norms, those things which are bad because they are prohibited, not bad in themselves. It's important if we want to export freedom of speech and freedom from self-incrimination, to push for an international norm of limiting the powers of governments, not of people. Of course, since the main way that the <em>international</em> reach of governments is limited is through treaties negotiated by, umm, governments, I don't expect a lot of that soon.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not to mention the creation of fake Facebook accounts by Iranian intelligence.

                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                Five interviewees who traveled to Iran in recent months said they were forced by police at Tehran's airport to log in to their Facebook accounts. Several reported having their passports confiscated because of harsh criticism they had posted online about the way the Iranian government had handled its controversial elections earlier this year.
                            </blockquote>and
                            <blockquote>
                                One 28-year-old physician who lives in Dubai said that in July he was asked to log on to his Facebook account by a security guard upon arrival in Tehran's airport. At first, he says, he lied and said he didn't have one. So the guard took him to a small room with a laptop and did a Google search for his name. His Facebook account turned up, he says, and his passport was confiscated.
