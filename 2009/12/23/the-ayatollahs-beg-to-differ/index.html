                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <a href="http://progressiverealist.org/blogpost/mullahs-versus-mullahs">Matt Duss</a> makes some excellent points (complete with useful links) regarding the growing religious opposition in Iran.  The main takeaway: Islamist mullahs of high standing are attacking the Ahmadinejad/Khamenei regime on Islamic grounds, and the varying attitudes that Islamists take toward democratic principles should inform our understanding of the different strains of Islamism. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Part of the ire of of the opposition mullahs, as Duss points out, has to do with the rising power of the increasingly secular, only opportunistically religious Revolutionary Guard Corps, but also, importantly, the weakening of democratic principles in general:
                                </p>

                                        Here’s an easy way to tell where someone stands on the Iran question: If they constantly refer to “the mullahs” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mullah">religious leaders</a>) who rule Iran, then you’re most likely dealing with someone who is <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/michaelledeen/2009/12/18/the-extended-finger-from-the-mullahs-clenched-fist/">disdainful of U.S.-Iran engagement</a>, who thinks that the only problem with the Bush administration’s 2003-06 hardline approach was that <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/26/opinion/oe-bolton26">it wasn’t hard enough</a>, and who buys <a href="http://www.amazon.com/World-War-IV-Struggle-Islamofascism/dp/0385522215">the nonsensical “Islamofascist” construct</a> that powered the “Global War on Terror.” You’re probably also dealing with someone who either hasn’t been following, or would like to ignore, the way that the Iranian system has been changing, especially in the wake of the June 12 elections, from one controlled primarily by “the mullahs” into one that, though still presided over by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei and furnished with a fading veneer of religious legitimacy by a cadre of extremist clerics, is <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2009/11/hbc-90006158">increasingly a military dictatorship</a> controlled by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps.

                                        While using “the mullahs” in such a pejorative fashion may allow certain commentators to communicate their prejudices in a marginally acceptable way and stoke fear of <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/dec/15/tehrans-nuclear-trigger/">scary guys in robes and turbans</a>, it also elides one of the most important aspects of the current situation in Iran: The role of the mullahs in confronting “the mullahs.”

                                    Duss continues, discussing the recent death of the most formidable opposition religious voice:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">

                                        Flipping through the TV channels late last night, I landed on <a href="http://www.cbn.com/700club/">the 700 Club</a> just as Pat Robertson was offering his, err, “analysis” of Iran. Suppressing with great difficulty the urge to turn away from the stupid, I watched as Pat assured his viewers that the Iranian people “hate those mullahs,” but then noted that the latest <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/world/middleeast/22cleric.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world">anti-government demonstrations</a> had occurred at the funeral of the dissident <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/grand-ayatollah-hossein-ali-montazeri-1922-2009.html">Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Montazeri</a>, “one of the better-liked mullahs.” I could see on Pat’s face that he realized that he’d just kind of clowned himself, but this is the situation that a lot of conservatives find themselves in now. Having fulminated for years against “the mullahs,” they’re unsure how to react to an Iranian opposition movement powered in considerable part by mullahs.

                                        And not just mullahs, but Islamist mullahs, such as Montazeri himself, who even though he had <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/09/14/montazeri-clerics-must-reject-irans-military-regime/">turned against</a> what the Iranian Islamic Republic had become, remained a firm believer in the principles of the Iranian revolution, in the idea of an Islamic Republic, and in the appropriateness of Islam as the organizing force in society.

                                    The religious/democratic based critique is being echoed by leading opposition political figures as well, such as <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6964530.ece">Mehdi Karroubi</a>:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">

                                        President Ahmadinejad has betrayed the Iranian Revolution, violated the country’s Constitution and may be unable to serve his full term, his most vocal opposition rival has told <em>The Times</em>. [...]
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Responding to written questions, Mr Karroubi mocked the regime’s charge that the opposition was guilty of sedition. He said that it was the regime that was hijacking the revolution. Mr Karroubi declared: “In today’s Iran, republicanism and Islamism are severely damaged and a lot of the revolution’s principles and the Imam’s \ have been undermined.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The people had lost the right to make their own decisions. The military now controlled politics, the economy and even cultural affairs. The rape and torture of detainees were shameful spots on Iranian and Islamic culture. “If the Imam were alive, without doubt this would not have happened,” he said. “As one of the Imam’s students and close friends I frankly say that those who claim to act on his thoughts had the least personal, emotional and intellectual closeness to him.”

                                    However, it is important to understand the likely parameters of this burgeoning opposition as well as the potential.  The opposition religious and political leaders are mostly of revolutionary pedigree, relying on closeness to Khomeini to shield their boldness of action and word.  Further, the vast majority of these leaders prefer to maintain the Islamic framework for organizing social and political structures, and most also strongly favor continuing the nuclear program.
                                </p>
                                <p dir="ltr">
                                    Westerners should understand that for many Iranians, the nuclear program (and the West's attempts to contain it) is a proxy for a familiar colonial dynamic whose scars run deep.  Iranians believe that as a sovereign, signatory to the NPT, they are well within their rights to develop a nuclear program, and the interference from the West is yet another attempt by foreign powers to usurp their sovereignty and independence.  In other words, even if the "green" revolution swept to power, the pursuit of the nuclear program would continue apace. 
                                </p>

                                    Interestingly, the opposition leader in the last election, Mousavi, is a strong proponent of the nuclear power, and even recently attacked Ahmadinejad from the hawkish flank by critiquing the President's willingness to even consider compromises proposed by the West.  Karroubi, too, sounds a familiar note:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">

                                        In a surprising twist, however, Mehdi Karroubi warned the West against exploiting the regime’s weakness to strike a deal to halt a nuclear programme that was, he insisted, for peaceful purposes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “Nuclear science and achieving peaceful nuclear technology is a right reserved for all NPT [Nuclear Proliferation Treaty] members,” he said. “We ask Western governments not to use this internal situation as a bargaining chip with the present Iranian Government to reach agreements which would undermine the rights of the Iranian people.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        He also urged the West against trying to help the opposition in its battle against the regime, saying that such efforts would “pave the way for suppression and accusations of dependency on foreigners”. He added: “The challenges in this country should be solved by its own people.”  
                                    </p>

                                    Regarding that last point, it is easy to appreciate President Obama's decision to keep a low profile during the election-related protests.  It was the best way to help the opposition.  A deeper understanding of the religious landscape also helps to dispel a lot of the fearmongering ginned up around the dread <em>mullahs</em>.
