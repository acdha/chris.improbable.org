                                This week's <a href="http://www.pollstar.com/">Pollstar</a> has a good article on recent goings-on:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote style="margin:1em;border:1px solid;padding:1em">
                                <a href="http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/news/archive/2009/12/11/701382.aspx"><b>SF's `War On Fun'</b></a>
                                <p>
                                    Siegan [of Red Devil Lounge] said he was cited for violating a condition of his license that forbids any sound to emanate from the inside of his building, regardless of a citywide noise ordinance that establishes a legal decibel ceiling.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "We have a condition on our license that says we may not have `any sound audible beyond the area under control of the licensee.'" Seigan said. [...] But the bottom line means that virtually any sound that leaks out of this venue apparently makes us in violation of our ABC license," Siegan explained.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Attorney John Hinman confirmed the condition of the Red Devil Lounge's license means that if a passerby can put his ear to the door and hear music, it would constitute a violation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He explained that one music venue client was told that to comply with a Type 47 license - an all-ages, bona fide eating place - a condition would be that every seat must have a "a plate, knife, fork and water glass for every customer. In a theatre, no less."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Hinman declined to name the venue with the formal place setting requirements but said he represented many owners who didn't want to be "targeted" by being identified.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "The venue operators in this state are terrified. You've got a regulatory agency in this state that is running a jihad against them," Hinman said.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "They've been out in full force. They've been in to [Slim's] twice in the last week," Holliday said. "They didn't do anything to us, but they cited the [venue] across the street because the audience wasn't leaving fast enough.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "They gave [the owner] a citation for that. Give me a break. It was 1:45 a.m. and people weren't leaving fast enough," Holliday said.
                                </p>

                                Undignified though it is, this is the part where I again remind you to please donate to our <a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/donate/">Legal Defense Fund</a> to make it easier for us to get through the <a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2009/11/10.html">twenty-five days in January</a> when the ABC is forcing us to close, because one of their undercover agents saw "lewd behavior" at an over-21 gay event.

                                In more pleasant news, photos and videos of <a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/gallery/2009/12-09/">Ãœmloud</a>, last week's <a href="http://www.umloud.org/">charity Rock Band event</a>, are up now. I wasn't expecting so many of the faux-bands to actually dress up! That was awesome.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It would have been hilariously circular if one of the games being played was the Rock Band predecessor game "SingStar Amped", because the intro sequence to that game was actually <a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2008/07/02.html">filmed at DNA Lounge</a> in <a href="http://www.dnalounge.com/gallery/2007/04-05/">2007</a>, but alas, it was not to be.
                            </p>
