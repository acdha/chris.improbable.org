                        <blockquote>
                            For obvious reasons, California law forbids cities from sharing revenue from red light cameras with the vendors who operate the cameras. Apparently, cities have found a way to <a href="http://www.thenewspaper.com/news/29/2918.asp">get around</a> this restriction:
                            <blockquote>
                                California law explicitly bans local jurisdictions from rewarding red light camera companies with payments based on the number of citations issued or as a percentage of fines generated. At least fifty cities have attempted to skirt this requirement with a clever arrangement known as cost neutrality. These contract provisions allow a city to pay the contractor based on the number of citations issued up to a certain monthly amount. After this cap is reached, the city keeps all of the revenue generated. The provisions are designed to ensure that cities can only profit from photo ticketing and will never pay to operate the program.
                                <p>
                                    "If the total compensation paid to Redflex pursuant to this agreement exceeds that portion of fines received by customer for citations issued during the same twelve (12) month period, then Redflex agrees to absorb, eliminate, or reimburse customer for the excess expense thereby covering the cost for system operation so that the customer achieves cost neutrality in accordance with the representation that the system(s) shall pay for themselves," Section 6.5 of San Mateo's contract states.
                                </p>

                                This pretty clearly gives the vendor an incentive to issue more tickets, and the judge in the case linked above concluded that it violated the law and struck down the program. With that said, I'm not aware of any evidence that red light camera companies do anything to issue bogus tickets. There likely are some ways to issue tickets when people weren't really violating the red light (e.g., by issuing bogus timestamps; I don't think the photos include the light in the frame), but that isn't to say that the companies which operate the cameras do anything like that.
