                            <p>
                                Foreigners reading this blog might be interested to learn that one of the UK's quaint political customs is to hold general elections at random intervals of no more than five years. That is to say: the Prime Minister can seek the royal assent to dissolve parliament and go to the country at any time, but <em>must</em> do so in any event no more than 60 months after the previous election.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is probably no secret that <a href="http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=336">Labour are going down in flames</a>. (More <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/politics_show/8278462.stm">here</a>, not to mention "there" and "everywhere" — google is your friend.) The upcoming general election is the Conservatives to lose — and it'd pretty much take something like the shadow cabinet being found in bed with a dead goat and a live boy to turn the tide at this point.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (NB: I am not planning on voting Conservative. I am not planning on voting Labour. Being a Volvo-driving granola-munching Guardian-reading liberal media beardie weirdie, I am voting for the Other Lot, aka the Third Party, the Forlorn Hope: the Liberal Democrats. They don't stand a hope in hell of winning, but I will take great pleasure if their candidate in my constituency kicks out the lying apparatchik who's currently occupying a seat in the Commons, and it's still possible, just barely, to daydream about a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_parliament">hung parliament</a>.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anyway, this is a digression. The point is: unless they rig the election as shamelessly as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_presidential_election,_2009">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a>, Labour are going to be out on their ear and we're going to have a Conservative government. What are the consequences for Scotland?<br>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So far I've mostly noticed a deafening silence on this matter from the mainstream press, with the honourable exception of a very perceptive opinion piece in the Guardian by Jackie Ashley, titled: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/oct/04/cameron-lisbon-referendum-scotland">Cameron could well be the last ever UK prime minister</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To those of you who aren't familiar with Scottish politics, that might sound a little apocalyptic. But I've been living in Edinburgh for 14 years, and I wouldn't rule it out.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The conservatives are going to win a general election <em>in England and Wales</em>. But north of the border, they might win as many as two out of eighty seats. They're still widely hated in Scotland, as a result of <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article6860088.ece">Thatcher's legacy</a> — Thatcher basically ran Scotland as a fiefdom from London, sucking oil and revenue out of the north and lavishing it on the Tory heartlands down south. (A parliamentary question asked of the COI in 1997, just before the election that swept Tony Blair to power, "what was the net difference between tax revenues raised in Scotland and tax revenues disbursed in Scotland between 1980 and 1990?" The answer from the Central Statistical Office was: £40Bn. That works out at about £4,000 <em>per person, per year</em>, flowing south.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here in Scotland we've now got a devolved parliament of our own, and <em>that</em> one's due to have an election no later than mid-2011.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The current government is a minority one (yes, we've got a hung parliament): the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party">Scottish National Party</a> are in charge, although they rely on other parties to get legislation passed. The SNP are formally in favour of outright independence for Scotland, as an EU member nation; and they're committed to holding a referendum on independence in 2011, before the next election. (Labour and the Lib Dems oppose this. The Tories do too, but they're so marginal that nobody pays any attention to them.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here's the rub. As things stand, the SNP would <em>lose</em> a vote on independence at this point. But under a conservative government in Westminster — especially one that's <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-must-cut-spending-or-raise-taxes-say-experts-1519074.html">wielding the axe of public service cuts</a>, which <em>is going to happen whoever wins the election</em> and which will disproportionately hit the less well off, which includes a lot of Scots — well, I'd handicap things by giving the pro-independence vote an automatic bonus of 10%.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A sensitive, caring, next-generation Conservative government will therefore be at pains to tread lightly north of the border, and to attempt to defuse nationalist sentiment. Or will it?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the one hand, to give them their full title, they're the Conservative <em>and Unionist</em> Party, dedicated to preserving the union. But if they cut Scotland loose, then, in a 650 seat parliamentary system, they lose 80 seats, <em>78 of which belong to their rivals</em>. Leave aside the fact that Cameron is committed to reducing the number of constituency seats in the UK: the 10% of them elected by Scotland are overwhelmingly not conservative. Ditching them will give the Conservatives an electoral lift that will last for a generation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That's got to be a temptation, even to a leader who "loathes the idea of being the last ever prime minister of the United Kingdom".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>PS</b>: No, I don't like the SNP either. My position is that religion has no place in politics in a multi-ethnic secular society: as <a href="http://www.scottishmediamonitor.com/features2.cfm?ID=40">the SNP are in bed with homophobic fundamentalists</a> you should find it easy to understand why I've got a problem with them. Why can't we have a box on the ballot for "none of the above"?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>PPS</b>: Just to make it glaringly clear what the stakes are, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/scotland/2463463/Alex-Salmond-demands-preparation-for-Scottish-independence-begin.html">Civil Service contingency planning for Scottish Independence began last year</a>.
