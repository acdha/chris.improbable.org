                                    Quotable 'conservative dissident' <a href="http://www.amconmag.com/larison/2009/10/23/the-gop-is-adrift/">Daniel Larison</a> on the GOP's&nbsp;bizarre obsession with&nbsp;the decision by the Obama administration to scale back the prior administration's missile defense policies in Eastern Europe:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">
                                    <p>
                                        Cheney’s recent speech at the Center for Security Policy is much what you would expect from him, but that is not what interests me here. What I find interesting is how obsessed Republicans have become in making the missile defense decision into a central part of their foreign policy indictment of Obama. <a href="http://mikepence.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3685&amp;Itemid=71">Pence</a>, <a href="http://www.amconmag.com/blog/2009/09/17/romney-and-santorums-missile-defense/">Romney, Santorum</a> and <a href="http://www.amconmag.com/larison/2009/10/01/pawlenty-and-foreign-policy/">Pawlenty</a> have all taken a whack at it, leading members of the conservative movement have <a href="http://www.amconmag.com/larison/2009/09/18/the-bankruptcy-of-the-movement/">denounced the move</a>, and it has been one of the favorites in many columnists’ repertoires. <strong>You have never seen so many people suddenly discover the necessity of consulting with allies. Of course, these allies are not counseling Washington against rash, foolish actions, but they are instead helping Washington to antagonize another major power and encouraging our government in its own worst instincts. Naturally, the latter appeals to people who cheered on one blunder after another for the last eight years.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        So far, the missile defense decision is one of the very few major substantive foreign policy acts Obama has made, and it was clearly the right one as far as relations with Russia, European security and American spending were concerned. Using this as the cudgel with which to batter Obama’s “foreign policy drift” is a sign of how far removed the GOP has become from common sense in this area. Were it limited to Cheney, one could write it off as sour grapes from a failed, old man, but it isn’t. It’s as if the Democrats had fixated on the nuclear deal with India (one of the few genuinely constructive moves the last administration made in regulating proliferation and shoring up relations with India), and then began mouthing Islamabad’s talking points on why this was a disastrous course of action. Had they done so, they would have made it clear that there was absolutely nothing the administration attempted that they would not subject to pathetic, reflexive opposition. As it happens, while there were critics of the deal, it never became a significant part of the list of Bush’s foreign policy errors, much less a leading, central element of the attacks against him.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        There is no sense of proportion in Cheney’s remarks on this decision. <strong>He refers to an irrelevant interceptor system designed to counter a threat that doesn’t exist in the same breath as the Soviet invasion of Poland, which was ruinous for Poland and one of the great crimes of the last century.</strong>Aside from a coincidence in timing, there was and is no connection between the two things and it is pure demagoguery even to mention them together. Cheney speaks of the Czechs and Poles “walking the plank,” which implies execution and destruction, and nothing could be farther from the truth. Washington’s guarantees to central and eastern European NATO allies are as meaningful as they ever were, and this decision does not make the Czech Republic and Poland even slightly more vulnerable to Russia than they were before. As proponents of the missile defense system kept saying ad nauseam, the system posed no real threat to Russia, and they would have us believe that it was not even aimed at antagonizing the Russians. <strong>Now that this system will never come into existence, we are supposed to think that Obama has handed over two allied nations to Russia on a plate, when all that it does is return things to the status quo of 2005-06.</strong> What is so infuriating about the criticism of the missile defense decision is that it is the criticism actually creates the doubts about Washington’s willingness to fulfill American obligations that the critics are trying to lay at the administration’s door.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Cheney’s speech is useful as an example of how government activists always operate. They propose a scheme that is costly, unnecessary and probably dangerous to the common good, their successors attempt to scale back or modify the wasteful baggage with which they have been saddled, and then allies and members of the previous administration wail about the “abandonment” of this group and the “betrayal” of that one to defend the scheme they concocted, when no one was benefiting from the scheme in the first place and never would have benefited. Indeed, more often than not the scheme will hurt those it is supposed to aid, its costs will be far higher than originally projected, and it will create a number of negative consequences for which the schemers are unprepared and never considered. Where Republicans are concerned, this activism tends to be limited to military schemes and foreign policy boondoggles, but it applies just as well in other areas of policy. <strong>The constant ratchet effect this has ensures that no new scheme or proposed spending can ever be eliminated without tremendous effort and expenditure of political capital, and the end result is to make the state larger, more activist and an entity with its own set of interests increasingly divorced from the people it governs.</strong>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Looking at some larger questions, I find the missile defense quarrel to be a good example for thinking about the place of dissident conservatives in contemporary debates. <strong>Defending Europe from an Iranian threat that doesn’t exist and wouldn’t be directed at them if it did with a system that probably wouldn’t work is the sort of thing that one would think American conservatives would find laughably unnecessary. It is the purest sort of irrelevant government activity that does nothing for the United States, wastes the public’s money, and inflames other nations against us.</strong> The system’s relative, albeit still quite limited, popularity in the countries in question feeds off of Old World antagonisms that most Americans neither understand nor care to learn about. For most mainstream conservatives, none of this matters. The decision is “weak” and it is “appeasement,” therefore they oppose it.

                                    Larison is, of course, correct about the fiscally wasteful (massively), unnecessary and even counterproductive aspects of the boondoggle that is "missile defense."&nbsp;&nbsp;He's also right about a Republican Party leadership that has increasingly become&nbsp;subservient to&nbsp;defense industry interests - never meeting a weapons system or armed conflict it didn't like.&nbsp; This reminds me of a question <a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/?p=28719">DougJ</a>&nbsp;posed on the curious, yet persevering, popularity of neoconservatism in GOP/mainstream circles:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote dir="ltr">

                                        The thing I always wonder is: how did the neocons amass so much influence? Everything they attempt fails and, when you consider how unpersuasive their arguments are, this failure isn’t surprising. How did it come to pass that a naive-sounding theory with no supporting body of empirical evidence became so influential?
                                    </p>

                                    Larison nibbles at the edges of providing an answer to that query, but <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/03/26/project-for-the-rehabilitation-of-neoconservatism/">Matt Duss</a>&nbsp;nails it when discussing the latest neoconservative incarnation to rise, phoenix like, out of the ashes of the last neocon vehicle:

Given the staggering costs in American blood, treasure, security, and reputation incurred by their boundless enthusiasm for blowing stuff up, you might think they’d have had the decency to retreat to a Tibetan monastery by now, but sadly no. <strong>The way it works in Washington is, if you’re willing to argue for more defense spending, you’ll always find someone willing to fund your think tank.</strong> [emphasis added throughout]
