                            <p>
                                It is surprising perhaps that the white wedding is still in vogue. There is nothing truly traditional about it. It was invented by the Victorians to show that the lady was rich enough to have a dress that was used only once. Victorian fathers "gave" their daughters away wearing virginal white and a veil as a substitute for her long hair worn use, originally the symbol of virginity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This begs the question why the modern independent woman feels obliged to wear the same attire. Before the Victorians, English brides were more pragmatic; they simply wore their best gown, which was unlikely to be white and was expected to do many years' service.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When the state started taxing marriage in the 1690s, the vicar of Tetbury in Gloucestershire carried out a survey of his parishioners to find out how many had been married in church. He was covering his back â€“ clergymen who failed to ensure that their parishioners were officially married were penalised. He discovered that half of them had not been married in church, but clandestinely, making private vows to each other, or married in a private dwelling by some roving clergyman. They were living in stable, but irregular unions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Given the choice, those unencumbered by property preferred to avoid the expense and rigmarole of an official church wedding and spend their money on drinking to celebrate the new partnership. Dodging the newly imposed tax and resentment at the state's interference in their private business provided further incentives to live in "common law unions" that had no basis in law and did not carry property rights. As long as a couple considered themselves "married in the sight of God" and was "reputed lawful man and wife amongst their neighbours" the forms of ceremony mattered little to them.
