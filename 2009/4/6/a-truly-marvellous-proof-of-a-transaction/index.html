                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                When you transact with an EMV payment card (a “Chip and PIN” card), typical UK operation is for the bank to exchange three authentication “cryptograms”. First comes the request from the card (the ARQC), then comes the response from the bank (the ARPC) and finally the transaction certificate (TC). The idea with the transaction certificate is that the card signs off on the correct completion of the protocol, having received the response from the bank and accepted it. The resulting TC is supposed to be a sort of “proof of transaction”, and because it certifies the completion of the entire transaction at a technical level, one can presume that both the money was deducted and the goods were handed over. In an offline transaction, one can ask the card to produce a TC straight away (no AQRC and ARPC), and depending on various risk management settings, it will normally do so. So, what can you do with a TC?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well, the TC is sent off to the settlment and clearing system, along with millions of others, and there it sits in the transaction logs. These logs get validated as part of clearing and the MAC is checked (or it should be). In practice the checks may get deferred until there is a dispute over a transaction (i.e. a human complains). The downside is, if you don’t check all TCs, you can’t spot offline fraud in the chip and pin system. Should a concerned party dispute a transaction, the investigation team will pull the record, and use a special software tool to validate the TC - objective proof that the card was involved.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another place the TC gets put is on your receipt. An unscientific poll of my wallet reveals 13 EMV receipts with TCs present (if you see a hex string like D3803D679B33F16E8 you’ve found it) and 7 without - 65% of my receipts have one. The idea is that the receipt can stand as a cryptographic record of the transaction, should the banks logs fail or somehow be munged.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But there is a bit of a problem: sometimes there isn’t enough space for all the data. It’s a common problem: Mr. Fermat had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat's_Last_Theorem">truly marvellous proof of a proposition</a> but it wouldn’t fit in the margin, and unfortunately while the cryptogram fits on the receipt, you can’t check a MAC without knowing the input data, and EMV terminal software developers have a pretty haphazard approach to including this on the receipts… after all, paper costs money!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Look at the following receipts. Cab-Inn Aarhus has the AID, the ATC and various other input goodies to the MAC (sorry if I’m losing you in EMV technicalities); Ted Baker has the TC, the CVMR, the TSI, TVR and IACs (but no ATC), and the Credit Agricole cash withdrawal has the TC and little else. One doesn’t want to be stuck like Andrew Wiles spending seven years guessing the input data! Only at one shop have I seen the entire data required on the receipt (including CID et al) and it was (bizarrely) from a receipt for a Big Mac at McDonalds!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/receipts.jpg"><img src="http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/receipts.jpg" alt="Various POS receipts" title="receipts" width="300" height="225"></a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now in case of dispute one can brute force the missing data and guess up to missing 40 bits of data or so without undue difficulty. And there is much wrangling (indeed the subject of previous and current legal actions) about exactly what data should be provided, whether the card UDKs should be disclosed to both sides in a dispute, and generally what constitutes adequate proof.<br>
                                <br>
                                <a href="http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/fake-transaction-cert.png"><img src="http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/fake-transaction-cert.png" alt='A "fake" transaction certificate' title="fake-transaction-cert" width="300" height="225"></a><br>
                                <b>A “fake” transaction certificate</b><br>
                                <br>
                                But most worrying is something I observed last week, making a credit card purchase for internet access at an Airport: a <b>fake transaction certificate</b>. I can tell its a fake because it firstly its the wrong length, and secondly, it’s online — I only typed in my card number, and never plugged my card into a smartcard reader. Now I can only assume that some aesthetically minded developer decided that the online confirmation needed a transaction certificate so took any old hex field and just dumped it. It could be an innocent mistake. But whether or not the “margin was too small” to contain this TC, its a sad reflection on the state of proof in EMV when cryptographic data fields only appear for <i>decorative</i> purposes. Maybe some knowledgeable reader can shed some light on this?
