                                </p>

                                    Below is an excerpted Al-Hayat interview with Ahmed Chalabi, the man who the neoconservative braintrust (oxymoron?) promoted, during the run-up to the invasion, as the next leader of Iraq.  The same man whose word was bond in the Bush administration, and whose organization was funded with a monthly six-figure stipend in order to produce useful, if almost always spectacularly erroneous, intelligence. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is likely the case that there were some neocons and/or Bush administration officials that were using Chalabi, cynically, to further their own ends.  But it is also likely the case that some were sincerely duped by the Iraqi snake oil salesman.  Here's the thing, though: regardless of the underlying credulity, they were all being taken for a ride.  From <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/04/15/chalabi-iran-benefited-from-toppling-saddam/">Matt Duss</a>:

                                        <p>
                                            [Al-Hayat]: If you want to describe George Bush, then how would you describe him?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            [Chalabi]: A man with very little skill and knowledge.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            [Al-Hayat]: He did Iran a great service by toppling Saddam?

                                        <p>
                                            [Chalabi]: Iran benefited from toppling Saddam. Bush didn’t mean to do it a favor but it was clear that Iran would benefit from Saddam’s fall. I am convinced that Saddam would not have fallen except for an implicit agreement between America and Iran.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            [Al-Hayat]: This happened?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            [Chalabi]: Yes, of course it did.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            [Al-Hayat]: Through whom?

                                        <p>
                                            [Chalabi]: We worked on this and so did the Supreme Council and Jalal Talbani.

                                        The idea that <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article2602615.ece">Iran has been the main beneficiary</a> of the Iraq war isn’t particularly controversial any more — except, of course, among <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/12/10/neocons-still-misunderstanding-irans-role-in-iraq/">the war’s neoconservative advocates</a>, who continue to insist that removing Iran’s greatest enemy and empowering <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/01/shia_report.html">Iraqi factions</a> with longstanding <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2008/04/iran_oped.html">close ties to Iran</a> was a huge defeat for Iran. Incidentally, many of these people — <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/03/09/chalabi-mccain/">Sen. John McCain</a> and his adviser <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/05/21/chalabis-lobbyist/">Randy Scheunemann</a> among them — were also Chalabi’s <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/03/31/pnac-activist-downplays-pnac-role-in-iraq-war/">biggest boosters</a>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Like <a href="http://ricks.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/04/14/chalabi_charges_bush_with_conspiring_with_iran">Ricks</a>, I’d be very interested to hear more about the “implicit agreement” that Chalabi asserts between the U.S. and Iran. Given what’s known now about Chalabi’s <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24050898/page/2/">cooperation with Iran’s intelligence services</a>, though, it’s pretty chilling to consider how close some of <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/05/21/chalabis-lobbyist/">Chalabi’s marks</a> came to taking the White House last November. Unfortunately, as shown by the continuing prominence of <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/02/25/mccain-wakes-up-to-war-in-afghanistan/">McCain</a>, <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/03/30/kristol-accountability-is-for-suckers/">Bill Kristol</a>, <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2008/10/28/mccain-adviser-dismisses-evidence-of-bushs-iraq-dishonesty-as-conspiracy-theories/">Robert Kagan</a> and other neocon fantasists, inadvertently aiding America’s enemies is no barrier to <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/03/26/project-for-the-rehabilitation-of-neoconservatism/"><font color="#810081">influence in American foreign policy</font></a>, as long as one is always careful to err on the side of war, and meticulous in dressing one’s belligerent strategic stupidity in patriotic drag.

                                    From Tehran's perspective, with enemies like us, who needs ultra-powerful military proxies to do their bidding?  The ruling regime was no doubt crestfallen when Obama was elected, as opposed to McCain.  Now Obama's gone and <a href="http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/04/14/obamas-game-changing-iran-diplomacy/">made life harder</a> for them.
