                                    [W]alling involves quickly pulling the person forward and then thrusting him against a flexible false wall.  You have informed us that the sound of hitting the wall will actually be far worse than any possible injury[.]  The use of the rolled towel around the neck also reduces any risk of injury.  While it may hurt to be pushed against the wall, any pain experienced is not of the intensity associated with serious physical injury. <br>

                                    In a federal court filing, Abu Zubaida's attorneys said he "has suffered approximately 175 seizures that appear to be directly related to his extensive torture -- particularly damage to Petitioner's head that was the result of beatings sustained at the hands of CIA interrogators and exacerbated by his lengthy isolation."<br>

                                    Abu Zubaida said interrogators wrapped a towel around his neck and slammed him into a plywood wall mounted in his cell. He was also repeatedly slapped in the face, he said. After the beatings, he was placed in coffinlike wooden boxes in which he was forced to crouch, with no light and a restricted air supply, he said.

                                    "The stress on my legs held in this position meant my wounds both in my leg and stomach became very painful," he told the ICRC.

                                    Walling does not in and of itself inflict severe pain or suffering.  Like the facial slap, walling may alter the subject's expectation as to the treatment he believes he will receive.  Nonetheless, the character of the action falls so far short of inflicting pain or suffering within the meaning of the statute that even if he inferred that greater aggressiveness was to follow, the type of actions that could be reasonably [] anticipated would still fall below anything sufficient to inflict severe physical pain or suffering under the statute.

                                    During interrogations, the captives were <strong>routinely</strong> beaten, doused with cold water and slammed head-first into walls.  . . .  "<strong>On a daily basis</strong> . . . a collar was looped around my neck and then used to slam me against the walls of the interrogation room," the report quotes detainee Tawfiq bin Attash, also known as Walid Muhammad bin Attash, as saying.
