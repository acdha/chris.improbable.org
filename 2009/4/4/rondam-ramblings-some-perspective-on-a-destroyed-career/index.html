                        <blockquote>
                            The gist of the original piece was that knowing Lisp gave my career an early boost because it was such a productivity multiplier, but later turned into a handicap because it led to frustration with the languages that were becoming the industry norms. The title of the piece was "How knowing Lisp destroyed my programming career" but that's a bit misleading. To understand how it's misleading and why I wrote it that way I have to give you a little bit more background. In particular, you have to understand the context in which that piece was written.<br>
                            <br>
                            "How knowing Lisp destroyed my programming career" was a followup to an earlier and even more inflammatory piece that called <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/browse_thread/thread/18cc7a823112559c/e86335fb4cc6c367?q=insubject%3Ahow+insubject%3Acommon+insubject%3Alisp+insubject%3Asucks&amp;lnk=ol&amp;">How Common Lisp Sucks</a>. That in turn was a follow up to literally <em>years</em> of off-and-on arguments about whether or not the Common Lisp standard ought to be revised. I thought (and still think) that it should be, but the overwhelming consensus in the Lisp community is that everything is just fine the way it is. (The argument is not unlike the one occasioned by my recent screed on <a href="http://rondam.blogspot.com/2009/02/why-css-should-not-be-used-for-layout.html">CSS</a> and <a href="http://rondam.blogspot.com/2009/02/css-and-meaning-of-life.html">several</a> <a href="http://rondam.blogspot.com/2009/02/on-semantics-of-html.html">followup</a> <a href="http://rondam.blogspot.com/2009/02/css-last-word-i-hope.html">posts</a>, including <a href="http://rondam.blogspot.com/2009/02/css-holy-war.html">this one</a>, which I think sums up both situations quite nicely. (One bit of evidence for this: of all the posts in the series, it is the one that has garnered the fewest comments.)<br>
                            <br>
                            The important thing to understand about that post is that it was not intended to be therapy or a confession, it was intended to be <a href="http://rondam.blogspot.com/2008/10/abiogenesis-and-art-of-persuasion.html">persuasive</a>. (It failed miserably, but that's neither here nor there.) The idea was to highlight the negative impact that knowing Lisp on the one hand and its failure to penetrate the market more deeply on the other had had on my career, in the hope that that might motivate some people to take market penetration more seriously. (Like I said, it didn't work. There is a hard-core group of Lispers who think Lisp is fine and dandy just the way it is and they honestly don't care whether Lisp is popular or not. These people wield enough influence in the community to effectively halt nearly all progress. But that is not what I want to talk about here.)<br>
