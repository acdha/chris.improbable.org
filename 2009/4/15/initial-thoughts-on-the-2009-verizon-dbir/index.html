                                Last night, the fine folks at Verizon posted the 2009 version of the <a href="http://securityblog.verizonbusiness.com/2009/04/15/2009-dbir/">DBIR</a>.  I haven’t had time to do a full deep dive yet, but I thought I’d share my initial notes in the meantime. Stuff in italics is from the DBIR, regular text is me:

                                81%? Wow, PCI really is hard. My initial questions was is this an implication that none were actually compliant at the time of the breach? This gets answered later in the report. The short version is “no not really.”<br>

                                Real data! This is awesome. Finally something other then the old FBI/CSI survey, may I never see it again on a vendor slide deck. Also I love Figure 5.

                                Figure 7 is fascinating in that we do see the truth that on average Internal breaches are far more devastating by nearly a factor of 3. However, they are 4 times LESS likely to happen. Really highlights the fact that although the really high profile cases like Hannaford and TJX were public, they are in fact edge cases.

                                At first glance, this is one of the best justifications for something  like PCI. By even raising the bar a little we can reduce the number of incidents. Interestingly, it would not necessarily reduce the overall number of records lost due to the high number of records (95%) falling into the the “high skill” category. I still think it’s worthwhile though. If we an with minimal effort reduce the number of incidents that means more time to focus on the high impact issues in the long run.

                                Looks like the basics of a good information security program . However, I do have a couple of nitpicks.

                                Rec #5.  There are other reasons to patch quickly and comprehensively then stopping data loss oriented breaches.  So saying that patches can be lower priority is ing somewhat overly focused on one aspect of security. It’d be very interesting to see the numbers  of  other types of incidents and what the impact of patching is on them.

                                Recs #7 and #8.  I’m a big fan of logging however unless you have the right tools then these are effectively impossible to do. And at this point I think effective log monitoring and traffic analysis is definitely in the realm of<br>
                                capability of only a select few enterprises. Side thought are orgs that use MSSPs for log monitoring having fewer incidents or at least lower impact incidents versus those that are doing it themselves?

                                Rec #4.  Given the prevelance of SQL injection, it would have been really nice to see a breakdown of whether they SQL injection was in a COTS package or an internally developed one.
