                            I find this debate bizarre given the extent to which conservatives were recently willing to pretend that very clearly worded parts of the constitution could be interpreted in ways which are incompatible with extant use of the English language.

                                    <em>by publius</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Part of the ongoing Koh debate is simply about the proper role that foreign law should play in American constitutional law.  And it's worth noting just how absurd this controversy is.  I mean, the rhetoric is completely disproportionate to the actual position of the Justices who are being attacked.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To summarize -- some Justices want to <em>look at</em> foreign law to help <em>inform</em> their judgment.  That's it.  They want to <em>look at it</em> -- much like they'd look at a Webster's Dictionary or an academic article.  But to many legal conservatives, merely looking is somehow equivalent to treating foreign law as <em>binding</em>.  The fear, I suppose, is that a mere glance will turn the Constitution into a pillar of salt.  (Note that I'm now talking now about the more general <em>foreign</em> law debate as opposed to the more narrow academic debate about customary <em>international</em> law).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Anyway, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/us/12ginsburg.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">Justice Ginsburg agrees</a> -- and admits not understanding what the big fuss is about:
                                </p>
                                <div style="margin-left:40px">
                                    “I frankly don’t understand all the brouhaha lately from Congress and even from some of my colleagues about referring to foreign law,” Justice Ginsburg said in her comments on Friday. . . .<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Justice Ginsburg said the controversy was based on the misunderstanding that citing a foreign precedent means the court considers itself bound by foreign law as opposed to merely being influenced by such power as its reasoning holds.
                                </div>
                                <p style="margin-left:40px">
                                    “Why shouldn’t we look to the wisdom of a judge from abroad with at least as much ease as we would read a law review article written by a professor?” she asked.
                                </p>

                                    Precisely.  It's the most ridiculous debate in all of constitutional law at the moment.  The alleged crime is <em>looking at</em> other decisions for non-binding guidance.
                                </p>

                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:40px">
                                    Having foreign laws guide American law is unconstitutional.

                                    Presidents sign it (or not in the case of an over-ridden veto) and courts interpret them.

                                    The justices are wrong in following foreign law — or even referring to them (with the exceptions being the Magna Carte and British common law).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A few points here.  First, he's wrong -- there's no constitutional provision (or decision that I know of) outlawing any sort of "guidance."  But second, notice that "British common law" is ok for him.  To translate -- foreign law is ok when it helps establish originalist interpretations.  Otherwise, not so much.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The fever among conservatives on this issue just continues to baffle me.  It's an almost pathological aversion to the broader world -- and it's hard to understand this as anything other than extreme ideological nationalism.
