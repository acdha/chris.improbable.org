                                    I propose that the World Wide Web would serve well as a framework for structuring much of the academic Computer Science curriculum. A study of the theory and practice of the Web’s technologies would traverse many key areas of our discipline. Furthermore, there is a natural way to structure such a traversal to support a course of study stretching over many semesters.
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>

                                        (One side-effect of such an approach is that graduates would enter the workforce with significant exposure to a suite of technologies that would likely be valuable in their professional careers. But that’s not the argument I’m making here.)
                                    </p>

                                    In the following layout, the course numbering implies a first guess at levels and prerequisites. Since I’ve never designed a curriculum before and my own undergraduate study is decades in the past, it’s quite likely that my suggestions as to the number of courses and semester levels need improvement.
