                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    <em>by publius</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2009/07/why-health-care-is-different.html">I’ve noted</a>, the Blue Dogs currently benefit from the Democratic Party’s institutional commitment to health care — both nationally and locally.&nbsp; Nationally, this commitment has helped elevate the Dems into the majority, which benefits every member of the caucus.&nbsp; Health care is a key part of the national brand, and it has strengthened party identification, loyalties, etc. for years.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Locally, health care gets individual Dems elected.&nbsp; Better health care is one of those rare issues (like Social Security) that Democrats can (and do) run on in every district in all 50 states.&nbsp; The strength of the “franchise's” reputation on this issue helps local candidates everywhere.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What’s annoying then is that the Blue Dogs aren’t returning the favor.&nbsp; They’re accepting the <em>benefits</em> of the party’s reputation on health care, while refusing to help build and maintain that reputation. It’s essentially the Little Red Hen problem — they want to eat the bread, but don’t want to help make it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Ross">Mike Ross</a> (D-AR) — the Blue Dog point man on coverage reform.&nbsp; Granted, he’s from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas%27s_4th_congressional_district">conservative district</a> (McCain won 58-39).&nbsp; And no one’s expecting him to toe the party line on every issue.&nbsp; But health care is different.&nbsp; Ross has benefited directly from the party's commitment to, and reputation on, health coverage reform.&nbsp; In fact, as I show below, he explicitly ran on health care in 2000 when he narrowly unseated Republican <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Dickey">Jay Dickey</a> (see below).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The point of the excerpts below is to show the value of the party’s health care reputation even to conservative Blue Dog Mike Ross.&nbsp; It helped him win.&nbsp; Yet now, when he’s got a chance to actually deliver, he’s <em>choosing</em> to drag the party down in a needlessly ostentatious way.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It’s not even the substance of the disagreement that most bothers me, but the <em>manner</em>.&nbsp; The Blue Dogs could rock the DC media establishment — and give Obama an enormous boost — by coming out this week and declaring that reform will happen hell or highwater.&nbsp; They have agency, and they could choose to negotiate with carrots rather than sticks.&nbsp; They could be the heroes in arguably the most important legislative debate of our generation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Instead, the preferred narrative — “we’ll go home you big liberals” — has fed Republican critiques and frames, and it’s threatening to drag the whole thing down.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Anyway, here’s a sampling of Ross’s reliance on the issue of health care in his 2000 victory over Dickey (all cites from Lexis):
