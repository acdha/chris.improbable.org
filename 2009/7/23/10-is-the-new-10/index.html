                                I’ve just been reading David Barnard’s “<a href="http://www.appcubby.com/blog/files/5_is_the_new_10.html">5 is the new 10</a>” post on App Store pricing and how he’s reduced all of the AppCubby apps from $10 to $5. I can see exactly why he did it, but I’m still a little bit disappointed. Not with David, I should hasten to add.

                                But the comment by Apple’s Tim Cook during the <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/141819/2009/07/apple_financials.html">earnings call</a> on Tuesday in response to a question on falling prices annoyed me somewhat:

                                    Developer sets the price, so it’s up to them what to charge. They’re doing what any good business person would do, doing the elasticity analysis, and figuring out where to sell price. As install base grows, it makes more and more sense to have lower prices, but that’s totally up to developers.

                                <a href="http://www.pcalc.com/">PCalc</a>, as you might know, is still $10. We just released a new 1.7 update this week – the tenth release of PCalc for the iPhone – which is getting some good press and positive feedback from users. Sales have been the best we’ve seen for a while, and so far, we’ve not had any complaints about the price from our users. But I think expectations on price are moving in the wrong direction, and statements like that from Apple don’t really help matters.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I still don’t think that lower than $10 price points are sustainable for more niche apps like PCalc, especially if you want to see continuous development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A few months ago, I <a href="http://www.dragthing.com/blog/?p=197">experimented with halving the price</a>. We hadn’t done a release for a while as I’d been away the previous month and sales had slowly fallen since the 1.5 release. I didn’t have anything ready to go at that point as I was working away on a version for (the then unreleased) iPhone OS 3.0. So, a discount made sense to try to keep PCalc in the public eye in lieu of a actual release.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The theory is that reducing the price will improve unit sales. The catch is of course that you don’t get as much revenue per unit. When we cut the price, I sent out press releases, and we saw a sales spike very similar to that of a new release. Over the course of the next month, sales tapered off again. We then released version 1.6, put the price went back up to $10, and saw another spike and gradual tapering off in sales.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Compared to the month following the release of PCalc 1.5, for the month of the price cut we saw an 82% increase in unit sales. Which sounds good, until you look at the total revenue figure, and that’s actually a <em>fall</em> of around 10% overall. In all cases I’m looking at the 31 days from date of release.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Compared to the month following the release of PCalc 1.6, the sale month was only a 23% increase in unit sales, or 39% <em>less</em> in total revenue.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, compared to the releases before and after, halving the price to $5 failed to increase our sales by the required amount. We might have made a little more money than we would have otherwise of course – if we didn’t do the promotion and didn’t get the resultant publicity, we wouldn’t have seen any sales spike at all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But in any case, it wasn’t the significant boost in sales that I expected it to be, and it doesn’t suggest to me that halving the price on a permanent basis would do us much good in the long term. We would certainly get an initial spike, but the level of sales when that has tailed off wouldn’t be twice what it is now.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Really, I think it depends on who your customers are, and what your product is. The market for games seems to be extremely price sensitive for example. If you have a product which has very broad consumer appeal, I can see how a lower price can help, especially if it’s at a low enough point where you’ll get impulse buys. Even I bought Peggle when it was 99c.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But if your app is unlikely to ever be in the top 100 because it doesn’t have that broad appeal, reducing your price is more than likely just going to cut your revenue in the long term.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the normal level of sales we get with PCalc, $10 is probably the lowest price we can charge that justifies the time we currently spend working on it. Even then, as a business, we’re only just breaking even.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And customers, if you want to see good quality software in the app store in the long term, you should really be asking developers to put their prices <em>up</em>.
                            </p>
