                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            I was yesterday, for the second time, on a call with the US Department Of Justice regarding how the Oracle / Sun deal could affect Open Source software, in particular MySQL and Java.<br>
                            <br>
                            I told them that I still think that my <a href="http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2009/04/to-be-free-or-not-to-be-free.html">original scenarios from April</a> are still valid. What has been worrying me lately is that Oracle has been quite vocal regarding their plans for most things related to the deal, like Sun hardware and Java, but has not said anything related to their plans regarding MySQL.<br>
                            <br>
                            During the MySQL conference and at other conferences afterwards I have been approached by numerous MySQL users that have been very worried about the future of MySQL. From this it's clear that most MySQL users are very interested to know what Oracle is up to, but those that have tried to inquire Oracle about this, myself included, have been met with complete silence.<br>
                            <br>
                            I strongly encourage Oracle to start talking publicly about their intentions regarding MySQL. If your plan is to continue developing MySQL as a true open source project and take it to new heights, I think it's critical to inform us, the MySQL community, about it ASAP. The more positive information we get, the more supportive we, the MySQL developers and users, can be about the deal.<br>
                            <br>
                            For those that are worried about the future of OSS software as part of the Oracle / Sun deal, and the affect (both good and bad) it may have on their business, the US Department of Justice is encouraging companies that are dependent on MySQL / Java to contact them and tell them how the deal may affect their business. The more information the department gets, the better equipped they will be in deciding what their recommendation for the deal will be.<br>
                            <br>
                            You can either <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/contact-us.html">contact the Department of Justice directly</a> or send an email to me at 'info at askmonty dot org' and I will forward it to those in charge.<br>
                            <br>
                            We at <a href="http://askmonty.org">Monty Program Ab</a> and <a href="http://www.odba.org">The Open Database alliance</a> are doing our best to ensure MySQL's future survival as one of the leading open source databases. By making your voice heard, you can make all our lives easier!
