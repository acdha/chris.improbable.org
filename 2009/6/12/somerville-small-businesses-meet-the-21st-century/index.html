                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/satanslaundromat/1365367101/"><img alt="" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1429/1365367101_601790ce8e.jpg?v=0" title="Somerville Ticket" width="375" height="500"></a>For those outside Boston, The ExpanDrive offices are located in Porter Square, which roughly straddles the border between the Cities of Somerville and Cambridge. While Cambridge has a long-standing reputation as a left-leaning, over-educated nerdocracy, Somerville is a far more complex place.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I used to live on Adams St, in Somerville’s Winter Hill neighborhood. Like the bulk of the city outside Porter and Davis, the neighborhood is difficult to access from the T (<a href="http://www.eot.state.ma.us/glx/">at least for now</a>), but Somerville’s 4.1 square-mile footprint means residents are never more than a 15-minute bike ride from anywhere else. Even with less-than-reliable bus service, only in the rarest of circumstances did I have trouble getting around.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The largest problem I had living in the city was parking. It’s so bad, in fact, that I <a href="http://blog.cosmocatalano.com/post/73644223/probably-my-most-productive-three-hours-of-2009">made a song about it</a>. Turned out to be pretty <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2009/02/08/citys_snow_alerts_get_a_techno_tuneup/">popular</a>, even getting some <a href="http://www.hereandnow.org/stand-alone-player/?fileUrl=http://www.bu.edu/wbur/storage/2009/02/hereandnow_0226_4.mp3&amp;fileTitle=Snow%20Emergency%20Remix">radio airplay</a>, so I feel like it should come as no surprise that the city announced <a href="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=1287E3FCF8CC0230&amp;p_docnum=12&amp;p_theme=gatehouse&amp;s_site=ZBCQ&amp;p_product=ZBCQ">new parking regulations</a> starting this summer. The rates essentially adjusted the costs of parking to reduce the demand.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What I did find surprising, however, was the idiocy of the response from local business owners—or at least those surveyed in a recent <a href="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=1287E3FCF8CC0230&amp;p_docnum=12&amp;p_theme=gatehouse&amp;s_site=ZBCQ&amp;p_product=ZBCQ">Somerville Journal article</a>.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                “Parking is a problem in the square anyways. It’s an almost like chasing people away in the square by doing this.”
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Yes, actually, that is the idea. Except that they’re trying to drive away cars. People don’t take up parking spots—cars do.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                “…the first time they get that $30 ticket, that’s probably the last time they’ll drive to Somerville.”
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Again, that’s the point. The $30 ticket makes the short walk from the $8 Alewife Garage or $6.50 Commuter Rail look like a bargain. If parking is overcrowded, you want alternate access to be more attractive.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                “It’s already frustrating, my staff is trying to work but they constantly have to be feeding their meters.”
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Regardless of the cost, meters still need to be fed. If your business’s performance is suffering because staff need to feed meters, you should be <em>in favor</em> of disincentives to driving.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                “… It’s just about making money, not about functional traffic and parking options.”
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Take a look out your Magoun Square studio between 4 and 6pm, where traffic is backed up four and five cycles at the Medford Street/Broadway intersection. Outside a <a href="http://www.retroland.com/pages/retropedia/toys/item/2397/">mad frenzy for Cabbage Patch kids</a>, you’ll never see a more obvious mismatch of supply and demand.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have a lot of respect for small business owners (except Jeff), but these statements display a pretty embarrassing lack of economic sense. Granted, most of the blame probably lies with <em>The Somerville Journal</em> for not interviewing any of the adamantly pro-cycling businesses (<a href="http://www.jplicks.com/">JP Licks</a>, <a href="http://www.redbones.com/">Redbones</a>, <a href="http://www.diesel-cafe.com/">Diesel Cafe</a>, to name a few) peppering Davis Square, but still, forcing car drivers to bear more responsibility for the costs they inflict isn’t something you’re going to see less of over the coming years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Bostonist <a href="http://bostonist.com/2009/06/12/mayor_joe_somerville_stop_whining_a.php">has it right</a>—precisely no one inside the greater Boston area has a reason to drive to Davis Square. Yes, the business owners are correct that this is a revenue generating move; Mayor Curtatone <a href="http://somervillenews.typepad.com/the_somerville_news/2009/06/parking-its-all-about-access.html">makes no bones</a> about that. But if its one that helps clear up Somerville’s <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2009/01/18/squares_red_lights_have_lost_their_meaning/">congestion</a>, <a href="http://www.somervillestep.org/2009/04/step_partners_w.html">pollution</a>, and <a href="http://www.somervillema.gov/newsDetail.cfm?instance_id=1461">noise</a> problems in the process, I can’t see why anyone in their right mind would complain.
