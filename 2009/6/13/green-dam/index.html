                                    Last week, <strong>it appeared the government backed away from requiring compulsory installation by users</strong>, but manufacturers are still being required to provide the software.

                                There’s a great deal of discussion in China right now about <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8094026.stm">the new government-mandated “Green Dam” Internet filtering software that must be installed on all PC’s in the People’s Republic of China</a>

                                <p>
                                    The potential faults were brought to light by Chinese computer experts who said the flaw could lead to a “large-scale disaster”.

                                    The Chinese government has mandated that all computers in the country must have the screening software installed.

                                I was in a taxi in Beijing a couple days ago and the driver was listening to a call-in/talk radio show whose topic was the software and its flaws/weaknesses.&nbsp; My post, however, had to wait until I returned states-side due to this ‘blog being blocked by the three different connections I tried to access it while I was in China.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The consensus about this software among the locals that I spoke to is that it will be widely ignored, except in places like primary schools and some government offices.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There is so much to say about this, however, that I almost don’t know where to begin.&nbsp; First, there is the issue of externalities.&nbsp; The benefit from this software are the government censors.&nbsp; The cost, however, will be borne by those whose machines are rendered less stable, less secure, and less useful (due to the censoring).&nbsp; This is the opposite of the theoretical goal of regulation–the transfer externalities back onto their creators, not the other way around.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The results here may be even more toxic than observers currently realize, however.&nbsp; By demanding compliance even when it does direct harm to those who must comply, the government undermines the loyalty of the citizenry and its own credibility.&nbsp; It may only be one straw on the camel of Chinese citizens’ discontent, but eventually, there will be a straw that breaks the camel’s back.&nbsp; This software has re-energized the domestic debate over the role of government censorship and whether their goal is to keep the populace safe or merely in-line.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Similarly, there is a lesson here for security and risk managers.&nbsp; Namely, policies must also be perceived as benefiting those they govern.&nbsp; Corporations whose policies are too obviously unfair or which demonstrate a contempt for employees produce similar disloyalty.&nbsp; While it may not be immediately obvious in the current job market–people generally won’t quit in protest if they can’t find another job–that makes the effect worse.&nbsp; A grumbling workforce is an unproductive workforce.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yes, we must achieve our goals, in my case protecting information, and the combination of reduced budgets and nervous employees makes it that much harder to achieve results.&nbsp; But in times like these, we also need to tread more lightly than ever since the resisters of policy–those employees who are more likely to be a risk–are more likely to stay with us and undermine it from within.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, as ever, when we are dealing with security, the mantra remains, “People, process and technology–in that order.” Any attempt to attack the problem otherwise frequently produces unintended–and often<br>
                                unwanted–results.
                            </p>

                                <em>When asked, I will argue that we already perform this filtering on our corporate proxy servers, but it does not change the fact that the government has created a huge externality for their population and for companies operating here as part of a futile attempt to prevent Chinese citizens from viewing porn or dissident political commentary–not necessarily in that order, IMHO.</em>
