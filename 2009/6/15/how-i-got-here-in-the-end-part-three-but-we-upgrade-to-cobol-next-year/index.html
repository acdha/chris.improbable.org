                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                In early 1988 I bought a small apartment. I sold it in early 1989, for a big enough profit to put myself back into university in order to escape a Fate Worse Than Death â€” the kind of career Leonard Cohen was singing about in "First we take Manhattan."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There was colateral damage, of course. As you can imagine, the kind of property bubble that funds career breaks for some breaks careers for others. I just barely hung on to my mortgage repayments during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Lawson">Nigel Lawson's</a> infamous inflationary "blip"; but the bubble's abrupt bursting in mid-1989 plunged the UK into a recession. I'd strongly recommend being a student during a recession ... but looking for a job afterwards is not so much fun.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And so ...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                ... What's a newly-minted graduate with no track record in the IT industry to do?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My patchy memory thankfully dims the residual trauma of the milk round interviews; let's just say, things were grim up north. And <em>this</em> time I was older and more cynical and not afraid to avoid being panicked into taking the first job that came along.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Case in point: a large British catalog shopping organization called, let's see, something like "Imperial Merchandise". Not the biggest catalog operation in the UK, but definitely not a small one, this company had a data centre in Bradford. And they were hiring programmers. So it came to pass that I grumbled and struggled into the old business suit (this was a year or so before I decided that I never, ever, wanted to wear a suit and tie <em>ever again</em>) and proceeded to go for a job interview.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Imperial Merchandise's IT division occupied a couple of floors of a grand sandstone edifice of Victorian vintage, down in the valley near Forster Square railway station. Bradford is ... well, it's the Yorkshire city that time forgot. There are worse places, but this city grew up on the back of the dark satanic mills of the early industrial revolution and the wool trade, and it hasn't forgotten the glory days. (Take IM's building back in time a century and you'd likely see it filled with whirring weaving machines run by sweated child labour instead of mainframes and serious-faced men in three-piece suits sitting in front of 3270 terminals.) My first stop was a reception area where a bored secretary, banging out dictation tapes on an Amstrad PCW, paged one of the IT department managers. My second stop was an office off one side of a vast, echoing grotto full of green screens operated by the aforementioned serious-faced men, and a chair on the other side of the desk from two of their tribal elders. Let's call them Mr X and Mr Y.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "We were very impressed by your CV," said Mr X.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mr Y nodded, poker-faced.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "We'd like to invite you back for a second interview. And an aptitude test."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "An aptitude test?" I asked.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Yes," said Mr Y. "To see if you're suited for programming."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At this point, alarm bells began ringing in my head. (Here is a hint: the top item on my CV was: "Computer Science Degree".)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "That's interesting," I said. "If I pass your aptitude test, what happens next?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Well, we would be inclined to make you a job offer. You'd join us with our regular autumn graduate intake, and we'd send you on a three month training course."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "A training course? What sort of material does it cover?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Oh, the usual stuff. What a computer is and how they operate, how to count in binary and hexadecimal, how to program."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                " ... " (Imagine, if you will, my noises of politely bemused agreement.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "And then you'd start as a trainee programmer!" said Mr X.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Hmm. What sort of systems do you operate here?" I asked.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "We have two Amdahl mainframes running MVS and VM/CMS. We keep all our stock lists in the databases on these machines, and there's a variety of software. Some of it is written in 360 assembler, but we also use PL/I and a variety of 4GLs --"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "But we upgrade to COBOL next year!" Mr Y added enthusiastically.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At this point a vision of my life in the world to come flashed through my mind's eye, and it was not a pretty vision, full of frolicking kittens and rainbows. It was more along the lines of wearing a three-piece suit each day as I toiled in a grim Victorian workhouse, learning an obsolete skill set just in time to be downsized as a result of one of the 12-monthly management changeovers. Imperial Merchandise was on its third new CEO and executive team in five years; there was no sign of networking or indeed of 1980s technology in the entire business, and I'd just about learned enough about relational algebra and database theory to spot an enterprise-wide transition to Oracle coming down the tidal bore like the mother of all tsunamis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I don't <em>think</em> I said "don't call me, I'll call you," as I left the interview. But I should have. And that's when I realized that looking for a job even one micron behind the bleeding edge of technology was a Bad Idea ...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (<em>To be continued</em> (along with more hair-raising career-related anecdotes from the early 90s, when I finish the final draft of this ?!*&amp;**!!@! novel ...))
