                                <p>
                                    Remember how Tom Tancredo went on CNN last week and <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/05/trancredo-sotomayor-is-member-of-latino-kkk.php">called</a> Sonia Sotomayor a racist, accusing her falsely of being a member of a "Latino KKK"? Well, if racism so offends him, how does he explain <a href="http://washingtonindependent.com/45075/tom-tancredo-and-the-n-word">this</a>?
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    On July 7, 2007, at approximately 7:15 p.m. at Jefferson and M Street, Northwest, in Washington, D.C., defendant was walking down the street making offensive remarks when he encountered the complainant, Ms. [REDACTED], who is African-American. The defendant uttered, "Nigger," as he delivered a karate chop to Ms. [REDACTED]'s head.
                                </blockquote>That defendant is named Marcus Epstein--a former Tancredo speechwriter who now works as executive director of Tancredo's political action committee.
                                <p>
                                    Epstein pled guilty to the charge, but, <a href="http://washingtonindependent.com/45075/tom-tancredo-and-the-n-word">according to Dave Weigel of <i>The Washington Independent</i>,</a> he'll remain on the job "until he leaves for law school in the fall."
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>My goodness.

                                <b>Bay Buchanan: After Assaulting Black Woman, Calling Her 'Nigger,' Epstein Was 'Lynched'</b><br>
                                By Brian Beutler - June 5, 2009, 4:12PM
                                <p>
                                    Bay Buchanan has once again responded to critics of her <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/06/tancredo-aide-pleads-guilty-to-karate-chopping-pedestrian-calling-her-nigger.php">karate chopping employee Marcus Epstein</a>. This time, though, she's taken it to the website of the conservative magazine Human Events.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In the piece she acknowledges both that she knew all along about Epstein's crime and that she nonetheless kept him on staff at both of the anti-immigrant organizations which she chairs--facts which she more or less <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/06/bay-buchanan-epstein-showed-tremendous-courage-turned-his-life-around.php">conceded</a> when I interviewed her earlier this week.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    She also <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=32155">writes this</a>: "What happened next was a modern day lynching by a faceless, angry, ignorant mob who reveled in the collective assault on their victim."
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>That's premium-grade BS. The blogosphere didn't have it in for Marcus Epstein. They picked up on the story because it's colorful and newsworthy. A rising right-wing politico who works for Tom Tancredo and Bay Buchanan went out in public drunk on his ass, made offensive remarks while walking down the street, and then committed an unprovoked assault on a passing black woman while addressing her as "nigger."
                            <p>
                                It takes a truly remarkable sense of entitlement, and zero sense of history, for Buchanan to label the perpetrator of this racist hate crime as the victim of "a modern day lynching," and the act of writing about it as a "collective assault." Buchanan's anger has nothing to do with affronted principle. It's all affronted privilege: one of <i>her</i> people has been disgraced. If positions had been reversed, and that nameless black woman had randomly assaulted Marcus Epstein and called him a racist epithet, I'm sure she'd have a very different take on it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Buchanan's tearjerker in <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=32155" rel="nofollow">Human Events</a> is a real piece of work. It's all about what a <i>terribly</i> troubled and talented young man Marcus Epstein is. (Funniest line: "I write this story not as an excuse for Marcusâ€™ actions.") Apparently he's got a severe problem with alcohol. He also suffers from depression, which is not surprising if he's drinking that much. I'm sorry to hear he's having such a hard time, but Buchanan's special pleading does nothing to alter the story or its significance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here's the crux of it: Epstein was stressed out and drunk at the time. That is, he was disinhibited. Anyone might behave badly under those circumstances. What's pertinent is the way in which he misbehaved. Disinhibition doesn't put ideas into your head. It lets the ideas that are already in there escape.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What came out of Marcus Epstein was racist hate speech plus an unprovoked attack on a passing black pedestrian. If Tom Tancredo and Bay Buchanan think those are acceptable sentiments for political operatives they employ--well, that's news.
