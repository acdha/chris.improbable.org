                            <p>
                                I'm still grappling with "The Fuller Memorandum" — or not, right now, because I'm recovering from the previously-mentioned head cold and in my experience, editing with a cold results in dumb mistakes — and the dilemma of what to write in this blog. I mean, I <em>could</em> draw your attention to the fact that I've just received my author copies of the hardcover edition(s) of "Wireless" and the UK paperback of "Saturn's Children", which means both of 'em are on their way from the publisher's warehouse to the bookstores, but that's just infomercial padding; I want to do something more in my copious spare time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the other hand, this isn't a political blog (at least, not primarily), a book review blog (if I say anything negative about someone else's books in public, conspiracy theorists will be lining up six deep for the cage-match: sorry folks, but I don't do feuds), or a travel blog (hey! Want to see my photographs of aviation museums and pubs?). And over the past nine years of blogging I've talked about a lot of the stuff that interests me, and I don't like repeating myself ...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But it occured to me a couple of days ago that I've been a full-time self-employed writer for over eight years now; and with a couple of exceptions, every company I ever worked for before then has gone bust (and as far as those exceptions go, I believe a statute of limitations probably applies by now). If you've looked at the potted biography on the back flap of most of my books, you'll have noticed weird references to my previous occupations — pharmacist, freelance journalist, dot-com startup monkey — none of which seem to have much in common with novelist. So over the next few days and weeks I'm going to try and describe how I ended up in this freelance writing job, and the weird and winding path I took to get there.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Back when I was a wee thing, the English educational system required schoolkids to make serious decisions about their future career structure <em>waaay</em> too early. Up to age 16 and the "O" level exams, you studied a range of about 7-10 subjects. Then, on the basis of your "O" levels (or the less rigorous CSE exams) you either left school at 16 and got a job, or you stayed on for two years to study 3-4 subjects in depth at "A" (advanced) level. "A" levels were the gateway to university admission; your choice of graduate degree determined which "A" levels you needed to study for admission. (They generally covered a subject to about as much depth as you'd reach in the second year of a contemporary American university course.) You didn't get to mix subjects; you were either going into the arts or the sciences or the professions. So at age 15 you needed to make your mind up what you'd be studying at university, and what kind of career you intended to go into.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I already knew (from an early age — 12 or so) that I wanted to be an SF writer. But there was a fly in the ointment — a fly called Margaret Thatcher. I turned 15 in 1979, the year the conservatives won an election and the Thatcherite revolution swung into action. Unemployment soared from around one million to over three million in twelve months as the UK experienced the worst industrial recession since the end of the second world war (largely caused by Thatcher's dramatic decision to cut most of the state-owned industries off at their knees, on the assumption that the workers would find new and more productive jobs sooner rather than later — a misplaced assumption, as it turned out). I come from a middle-class background; I could expect to go to university, but not to rely indefinitely on parental hand-outs. "You'll need some kind of way to earn a living while you're trying to write," the careers guidance teachers told me. And, not being sufficiently cynical back then — let alone sufficiently experienced to realize that the then-prevalent economic doom'n'gloom would eventually pass — I took the warnings at face value.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Given my grades, I <em>should</em> have studied English Literature. If you've got the head of your school's English department describing your failure to go for an "A" level in the subject as a "grave loss" to the department, that's probably a hint you should listen to. But I was doing okay in the sciences, and the whole "get a steady career" talk had spooked me. Not to mention that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XTC">Making Plans for Nigel</a> was all over the radio back then.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You're probably wondering why I didn't head into computing. It's one of those historical accidents; my school didn't acquire a computer lab until 1981, and didn't begin offering even "O" level computer science until the year I left. I wasn't <em>quite</em> good enough at mathematics to get the encouragement that would have made me go for a maths "A" level; that year the school maths department was picking and choosing. And without either mathematics or CS, studying CS for an undergraduate degree was out of the question.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So: what to do? Given my aptitudes and abilities, medicine was out; I happen to be cursed by a poor memory and a lazy disposition, and back then the entrance requirements for med school were at least as high as those for Oxbridge entrance. So I aimed at a second tier profession: dropped English at "A" level and by and by packed my bags and headed for London in 1983, to study pharmacy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And thus I sealed my fate for the next seven years. (Give me a time machine and let me go back to 1980 and I'll make sure my younger self doesn't make that particular mistake again even if I have to kneecap him. But that's another matter.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What followed is ... irrelevant. I figured out pretty early on that I was a square peg being trained for a round hole. Pharmacy isn't a profession that fits my strengths: you need an excellent memory, focussed attentiveness to detail, and little enough imagination that the prospect of accidentally poisoning or killing people doesn't keep you awake at night. I passed the degree (not well), got through a year's pre-registration work in a smallish regional hospital, then shifted to a job in a large regional teaching hospital in Yorkshire. The pay, not to put too fine a point on it, sucked mercilessly at that time; retail offered better money, at a price, so around early 1987 I began looking for a new job ....
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The price became clear six months into staffing a decrepit hole-in-the-wall in Halifax, when the local detectives got a hot tip-off and staked out my workplace for an armed robbery twice in one month. It was a piss-poor excuse for a shop, but it was round the corner from a local GP's practice in a poor part of town, and the passing trade was good for a prescription workload that would keep one pharmacist and one shop assistant busy for most of the day. What I knew and the detectives didn't was that my boss — the guy who owned that, and nine other, pharmacies — was a junkie; while he was building his business his marriage had disintegrated, and he'd begun hitting the stock. (At that particular time he was occupying a cell in Armley prison, having been caught speeding while stationary as it were.) Frankly, the Sweeny scared me a lot more than the robbers: the latter had hit ten pharmacies already that year without beating up, shooting, or injuring anyone. In contrast, the plainclothes firearms guys were taking lots of polaroids of the inside of my shop for reference if they had to storm the place in a hail of bullets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What can I say? I was 22, callow, had wasted the valuable socializing space you get at university by studying a hard technical subject I had little aptitude for for sixty hours a week; and all I'd managed to do that <em>really</em> counted in my own head was to sell a couple of short stories to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interzone_%28magazine%29">Interzone</a> and have a (first) serious relationship disintegrate messily. I was too naive to pull a long-term sickie; instead I took almost six weeks to get a new job, this time at a pharmacy chain with a slightly less demented management structure and clientelle.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I <em>had</em>, finally, figured out that the whole idea of using a career as a state-licensed drug dealer to support the writing habit was a horrible mistake. And that's when I began to get serious about looking for a new career ...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (Which process I shall describe in my next posting on the subject of "how I became a successful science fiction writer, the long way round".)
