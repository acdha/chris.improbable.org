                                    That's part of the problem:  a legacy of irresponsible spending by Bush that Obama has yet to address. But the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/business/economy/10leonhardt.html?_r=1&amp;hp">New York Times</a>' analysis (replicated by Matt Yglesias as a <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/what-caused-the-budget-deficit.php">pie chart</a>) is more about deflecting the blame from Obama than soberly assessing the problem.  Yglesias <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/what-caused-the-budget-deficit.php">is right that</a> the current "large" -- really, unprecedented -- "deficits aren’t a <em>moral</em> failing that we need to hold someone accountable for."  But solving the problem requires that we soberly assess the role of Obama's agenda in growing the national debt.

                                    I'm going to take the New York Times' analysis as it is, and not check the underlying work.  Based on the New York Time's analysis, causes of the swing from surplus to this year's (2009's) deficit can be broken into three components <strong>[modified]</strong>:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The recession, which resulted in lower tax receipts and accounts for approximately a third of the current deficit.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Bush-era programs that Obama either cannot or chooses not to eliminate or modify, such as the prescription drug plan.  This represents another third of the current deficit.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>
                                            Programs that Obama either endorsed or proposed -- another third of the current deficit.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>

                                    <strong>[UPDATE:</strong>  It's not clear from New York Times article but, as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/06/09/business/economy/20090610-leonhardt-graphic.html">this chart</a> makes clear, these three components actually caused a swing from a $800 billion <strong><em>surplus</em></strong> to a $1.2 trillion dollar deficit.  Put another way, the three above components total approximately $2 trillion -- $800 billion more than this year's deficit. If you could magically eliminate the recession and all the listed spending, we'd be $800 billion in the black.  The fact that the NYT purports to describe the swing from surplus to deficit rather than just the causes of the deficit seems to have <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/what-caused-the-budget-deficit.php">tripped up Yglesias as well</a>.  That puts me in good company, and suggests that the New York Times should have done a better job editing its article.  In any event, the change actually strengthens my point.]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That is, under the New York Times' accounting, up to <strike>two thirds</strike> <strong>virtually all</strong> of <em><strong>this year's</strong></em> deficit comes from programs under our control.  (Our control over future deficits is greater, as is the percentage attributable to Obama's programs in those future; it bears noting that those future deficits <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2009/06/let-it-come-down.html">are considerable</a>.)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You wouldn't know this, however, from either the New York Times' article or Yglesias' pie chart.  The confusion is most apparent in Yglesias' <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/what-caused-the-budget-deficit.php">chart</a>.   
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/.a/6a00d834515c2369e201156ff9a3f4970c-pi" style="display:inline"><img alt="Deficit" border="0" src="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/.a/6a00d834515c2369e201156ff9a3f4970c-800wi" title="Deficit"></a>  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>[UPDATE: </strong>As noted, it's not "contributions to the deficit," as Yglesias has on the chart, but contributions to the swing from $800 billion surplus to $1.2 trillion deficit.]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Yglesias puts the recession in blue on his chart. Fair enough.  But there's no acknowledgment in either his chart or his <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/what-caused-the-budget-deficit.php">piece</a> (which you should read in full) that whether we continue "Bush's policies" -- the part in red -- is wholly within the control of the Obama Administration and the near-supermajority of Democrats in Congress.  
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    True, many of these policies cannot be changed in the short term without incurring even more cost.  It's unfair to say that Obama is morally responsible for this spending.  But this isn't about assigning moral responsibility; it's about cutting a deficit -- including spending -- that has gotten out of control.  For example, if health care is going under the knife, and I fear that it is, Bush's costly prescription drugs plan should be on the operating table with it. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is also unhelpful to divide the share of the deficit that is unambiguously part of Obama's agenda -- and easiest to change -- into three slices (yellow, green, and grey) and then argue, <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/what-caused-the-budget-deficit.php">as Yglesias does</a>, that Obama's agenda is reflected only in the smallest (grey) slice.  That's can't be right:  The stimulus package is clearly part of Obama's agenda:  Obama proposed, fought for, and signed it.  Whose agenda was it, if not Obama's?  So are the policies that Bush proposed but that Obama adopted as part of <em><strong>Obama's agenda</strong></em> (yellow).  Slice it however you like, a third of 2009's deficit is caused by Obama's agenda -- which also accounts for proportionately more in future deficits.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Yglesias is correct that we need to treat today's and tomorrow's deficits as "a ... practical problem that will have to be solved."  To do that, we can't start by pushing the blame for the vast majority of today's deficit onto someone else when much of it is under our -- and Obama's -- control.
