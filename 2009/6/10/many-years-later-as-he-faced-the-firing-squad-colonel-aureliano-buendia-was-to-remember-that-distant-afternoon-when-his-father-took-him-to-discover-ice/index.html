                                    That's part of the problem:&nbsp; a legacy of irresponsible spending&nbsp;by Bush that Obama has yet to&nbsp;address. But the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/business/economy/10leonhardt.html?_r=1&amp;hp">New York Times</a>' analysis&nbsp;(replicated by&nbsp;Matt Yglesias as a&nbsp;<a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/what-caused-the-budget-deficit.php">pie chart</a>) is more about deflecting the blame from Obama than soberly assessing the problem.&nbsp; Yglesias <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/what-caused-the-budget-deficit.php">is right&nbsp;that</a> the current "large" -- really, unprecedented --&nbsp;"deficits aren’t a <em>moral</em> failing that we need to hold someone accountable for."&nbsp; But solving the problem requires that we soberly assess the role of Obama's agenda in growing the national debt.

                                    I'm going to take the New York Times'&nbsp;analysis as it is, and not check&nbsp;the underlying&nbsp;work.&nbsp; Based on the New York Time's analysis, causes of the swing from surplus to this year's (2009's) deficit can be broken into three components <strong>[modified]</strong>:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The recession, which resulted in lower tax receipts and accounts for approximately a third of the current deficit.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Bush-era programs that Obama either cannot or chooses not to eliminate or modify, such as the prescription drug plan.&nbsp; This represents another third of the current deficit.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>
                                            Programs that Obama either endorsed or proposed -- another third of the current deficit.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>

                                    <strong>[UPDATE:</strong>&nbsp; It's not clear from&nbsp;New York Times&nbsp;article but,&nbsp;as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/06/09/business/economy/20090610-leonhardt-graphic.html">this chart</a> makes clear,&nbsp;these three components actually caused a swing from a $800 billion <strong><em>surplus</em></strong> to a $1.2 trillion dollar deficit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Put another&nbsp;way, the&nbsp;three above components total approximately $2 trillion -- $800 billion more than this year's deficit.&nbsp;If you&nbsp;could magically&nbsp;eliminate the recession and all the listed spending, we'd be $800 billion in the black.&nbsp; The fact that the NYT purports to describe&nbsp;the swing from surplus to deficit rather than just the causes of the deficit&nbsp;seems to have <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/what-caused-the-budget-deficit.php">tripped up Yglesias as well</a>.&nbsp; That puts me in good company, and suggests that the New York Times&nbsp;should have done a better job editing its article.&nbsp; In any event, the change actually strengthens my point.]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That is,&nbsp;under the New York Times' accounting, up to <strike>two thirds</strike> <strong>virtually all</strong> of <em><strong>this year's</strong></em> deficit&nbsp;comes from&nbsp;programs under our control.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Our control over&nbsp;future deficits is greater,&nbsp;as is the&nbsp;percentage&nbsp;attributable to Obama's programs in those future; it bears noting that those future deficits <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2009/06/let-it-come-down.html">are considerable</a>.)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You wouldn't know this, however, from either the New York Times' article or Yglesias' pie chart.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;confusion is most&nbsp;apparent in Yglesias' <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/what-caused-the-budget-deficit.php">chart</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/.a/6a00d834515c2369e201156ff9a3f4970c-pi" style="display:inline"><img alt="Deficit" border="0" src="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/.a/6a00d834515c2369e201156ff9a3f4970c-800wi" title="Deficit"></a> &nbsp;

                                <p>
                                    <strong>[UPDATE:&nbsp;</strong>As noted,&nbsp;it's not "contributions to the deficit," as Yglesias has on the chart, but contributions to the swing from $800 billion surplus to $1.2 trillion deficit.]
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Yglesias puts the recession in blue on his chart. Fair enough.&nbsp; But there's no acknowledgment in either his chart or his <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/what-caused-the-budget-deficit.php">piece</a> (which you should read in full) that whether we continue "Bush's policies" -- the part in red -- is wholly within the control of the Obama Administration and the near-supermajority of Democrats in Congress.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    True, many of these policies cannot be changed in the short term without incurring even more cost.&nbsp; It's unfair to say that Obama is morally&nbsp;responsible for this spending.&nbsp; But this isn't about assigning moral responsibility; it's about cutting a deficit -- including spending&nbsp;-- that has gotten out of control. &nbsp;For example, if health care is&nbsp;going under the knife, and I fear that it is, Bush's costly prescription drugs plan should be on the operating table with it.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is also unhelpful to divide&nbsp;the&nbsp;share of the deficit that is unambiguously part of Obama's agenda -- and easiest to change --&nbsp;into three slices (yellow, green, and grey) and then argue, <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/06/what-caused-the-budget-deficit.php">as Yglesias does</a>, that Obama's agenda is reflected only in&nbsp;the smallest (grey) slice.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's&nbsp;can't be right:&nbsp; The stimulus package is clearly part of Obama's agenda:&nbsp; Obama proposed, fought for, and signed it.&nbsp; Whose agenda was it,&nbsp;if not Obama's?&nbsp; So are the policies that Bush proposed but that Obama adopted as part of <em><strong>Obama's agenda</strong></em> (yellow).&nbsp;&nbsp;Slice it however you like, a third of&nbsp;2009's deficit&nbsp;is caused by&nbsp;Obama's agenda --&nbsp;which also accounts for&nbsp;proportionately more in future deficits.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Yglesias is correct&nbsp;that we need to treat today's and tomorrow's deficits&nbsp;as&nbsp;"a ... practical problem that will have to be solved."&nbsp; To do that, we can't start by pushing the blame for the vast majority of today's deficit onto someone else when much of it is under our -- and Obama's -- control.
