                                Last week must have been a slow news week; a lot of headlines and newspaper column-inches were devoted to the shocking findings of a recent survey of women's health that apparently indicated that drinking <em>any</em> alcohol at all correlated with an elevated risk of cancer:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2009/feb/24/alcohol-cancer-risk-drinking">Even small amounts of alcohol increase a woman's risk of cancer"</a> (The Guardian)"

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here's the original paper: <a href="http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/djn514">Moderate Alcohol Intake and Cancer Incidence in Women</a>, by various authors from the Cancer Epidemiology Unit, University of Oxford.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Did any of the journalists who generated those scare headlines read it beyond the abstract?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Alas, the Journal of the National Cancer Institute keeps the actual text behind a paywall; which makes it hard for me to check <a href="http://junkfoodscience.blogspot.com/2009/03/in-vino-veritas-part-two.html">this takedown by Junkfood Science</a>. However, I feel the need to quote two chunks of that post (which you really ought to read):
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                ... there was no dose response between the number of drinks the women consumed and their risk for all cancers. Women drinking no alcohol at all had higher incidences for all cancers than 95% of the drinking women.
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                The actual incidents of all cancers was 5.7% among the nondrinkers. The cancer incidents were lower among the women drinking up to 15 drinks a week: 5.2% among those consuming ≤2 drinks/week; 5.2% of those drinking 3-6 drinks/week; and 5.3% among those drinking 7-14 drinks a week. [Table 1.]
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In other words, women drinking as many as two drinks a day were associated with <em>lower</em> actual incidences of all cancers compared with the nondrinkers.In other words, the abstract of the paper was radically at odds with the substance of the study's findings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Surprised? Let's carry on:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                ... as the Washington Post noted, “officials have long worried about sending the ‘wrong message’” about drinking, even though “it’s true that studies have indicated that moderate drinking may cut the risk of heart disease and other ailments.” The newspaper went on to report:
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                “[Moderate drinking] is a level of consumption that generally has been found in scientific studies to be associated with a relatively low risk of harms,” said Robert Brewer of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.* “But low risk does not mean no risk.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                * The newspaper failed to disclose that Dr. Brewer is manager and director of the Alcohol Team at the CDC; serves as Principal Investigator for Alcohol-Related Disease Impact software, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation; and has authored numerous publications on alcohol and alcohol-related health effects.Does this make the nature of the propaganda exercise clear enough yet?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Alcohol is evil. We know this because it is True. And it's especially bad for women because, well, women shouldn't drink. If you run a study to confirm this belief and the facts don't back you up, the facts are wrong. So tell the public the Truth (alcohol is always evil) and bury the facts; the press won't be able to tell the difference because they're (a) lazy (or overworked, take your pick) and (b) statistically innumerate."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is pernicious fallout from the way the 2000-2008 Bush administration did business. Their contempt for science was so manifest that distortion and suppression of results that undermined a desired political objective became a routine reflex. If the science doesn't back you up, lie about it or suppress it. That administration may have been shown the door (and replaced by one that so far seems to have a pragmatic respect for facts), but the disease has spread internationally, becoming endemic wherever ideologically motivated politicians who hold their electorate in contempt find themselves seeking a stick to beat the public with.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There's an anti-alcohol backlash in progress (especially <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/mar/02/scotland-drinking-proposals">here, in Scotland</a>); this propaganda-spun negative study is just the latest tired remix of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6696582420128930236">Reefer</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefer_Madness">Madness</a>.
