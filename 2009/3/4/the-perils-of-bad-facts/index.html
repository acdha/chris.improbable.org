                                    <em>by publius</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/03/again-with-standing-dodge.html">Scott Lemieux has already posted</a> on <em><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/07-463.ZS.html">Summers</a></em> – the standing case the Supreme Court released yesterday.&nbsp; To me, <em>Summers</em> illustrates just how important it is for public interest litigators to pick the “right facts.”&nbsp; Here, the environmental organization had to fight on very unfavorable terrain – and they lost.&nbsp; To borrow loosely from Holmes, bad facts make bad law.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Very briefly, the Court in <em>Summers</em> said that various environmental organizations lacked standing to challenge a Bush era Forest Service regulation.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Let’s say that a fire burns through a big chunk of a national forest.&nbsp; The Forest Service can arrange to sell the timber, but they must first allow for a notice, comment, and appeal process.&nbsp; In 2003, the Forest Service passed a regulation exempting small tracts of land from these procedural requirements.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In <em>Summers</em>, a fire had occurred in a national park and the Forest Service authorized a timber salvage sale for 238 acres of land (which was small enough to be exempted).&nbsp; Environmental groups sued, trying to get the regulation invalidated.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Here’s the key – the parties eventually settled their dispute <em>before</em> the court had ruled on the regulations.&nbsp; Despite that fact, the district court (and 9th Circuit) went on to invalidate the regulation even though the dispute had basically been settled.&nbsp; Scalia reversed, concluding that the environmental groups lacked standing because the case had settled.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The problem, then, is that these facts were very bad terrain to fight a standing battle on.&nbsp; Standing is important because it’s the doctrine conservative Justices have used to prevent citizens from suing for environmental violations (the idea is that you yourself aren’t necessarily injured by harms to the environment).&nbsp; The stricter that standing requirements are, the harder it is for public interest groups to bring litigation.&nbsp; That’s the political dimension here (in fact, I’d argue that standing is approximately 95% politics).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You can see the problem – the environmental groups were not only fighting a tough standing battle, they were doing it in a case where the underlying dispute had already been settled.&nbsp; Strategically, it’s just a horrible case to bring before the Court.&nbsp; I don’t know the details – but if the environmental groups had a chance to get out earlier, they should have done so and waited for a better case.&nbsp; But maybe the issue was forced on them – I don’t really know.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But the larger point is that picking the right case is a huge deal.&nbsp; <em>Lawrence v. Texas</em> is a great example – the facts of that case were so absurd that it was very favorable terrain to fight on.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Anyway, maybe the Court was right, maybe it was wrong – it sort of depends on if you buy the idea of strict standing requirements in the first place.&nbsp; But regardless, the facts couldn’t have been worse for the environmental groups.
                                </p>
