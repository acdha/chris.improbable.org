                            I'm not an expert on quantum computing, but luckily EG reader <a href="http://icouldbewrong.blogspot.com">Dan Simon</a> is. the other day in the comments section he <a href="http://www.educatedguesswork.org/2009/03/movie_piracy_and_threat_models.html#comments">explained</a> why he doesn't think it's very relevant. It's worth a read:
                            <blockquote>
                                My impression is that watermarking is to signal processing what quantum computing is to theoretical physics, or cryptography to number theory: a way for a massive oversupply of researchers in a once-proud field to make a claim to relevance.
                                <p>
                                    ...
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Basically, there is one thing that quantum computers have been found to be capable of doing much better than classical computers. That one thing has been characterized variously as "finding hidden subgroups", "solving the abelian stabilizer problem", or "finding periodicities in abelian groups". Because this one thing happens to lead to polynomial-time algorithms for integer factoring and discrete log, quantum computers have been bandied about as an incredible new computing technology, but the truth is that this one thing is really very limited in scope, and in a decade and a half, nobody's found another significant application for it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Moreover, there are lots of (admittedly informal) reasons for believing that quantum computers can't really do anything interesting beyond this one thing. So we're left with a technology that, even if perfected*, is unlikely to be able to accomplish anything of interest beyond solving a certain narrow class of number theory problems.**
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Dan goes on to observe that there are other public key algorithms not in wide use that don't appear to be vulnerable to quantum computing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This brings us to another class of people besides quantum computing researchers with an interest in hyping the technology: people working on alternatives to factoring and discrete-log based cryptosystems. The deployment cycle of new public key algorithms is incredibly slow: to a first order, everyone outside the government is still using RSA. This means that new public key algorithms with similar "interfaces" to existing algorithms (e.g., they're interchangeable but faster or more secure, etc.) don't have much of a real-world value proposition outside of specialized niches, especially as there are a whole slew of existing algorithms with better properties based on elliptic curves, pairings, etc. But if QC actually worked, then those systems would all be broken and we'd need to reinvent them based on different problems: instant job security for cryptographers.
                            </p>
