                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    <em>by publius</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/21/AR2009032101449.html">The EFCA compromise</a> being floated is a promising, if still inadequate, development.  It does, however, illustrate the importance of strong opening bargaining positions and sustained political pressure.  Both are starting to bear fruit.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Anyway, in thinking about the Whole Foods/Starbucks/Costco proposal, it’s worth remembering that the EFCA incorporates several distinct issues under one banner.  Specifically, there are at least three:  (1) the manner of the union election (secret ballot v. card check); (2) penalties for employer retaliation; and (3) binding arbitration after a specified negotiating period.  On some of these issues, I think compromise is fine.  On others, not so much.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The area with the most room for compromise is, ironically enough, the first and most well-known one – the manner of the election.  “Card check” voting isn’t an end unto itself.  It’s a <em>means</em> to avoid employer retaliation.  I don’t think any union would have a gripe about secret ballot elections if they happened quickly, were free from retaliation, and took place on a level playing field.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Exactly none of that, however, happens today.  When elections are called, companies drag things out and forbid unions from campaigning.  During that time, they threaten, bully, and fire employees and organizers.  It’s a complete sham democracy. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And that’s the whole point of card check – it’s a means to escape a “secret ballot” system that is rotten to the core.  If, however, these problems could be remedied in some other way, then secret ballot elections would be fine.  So on #1, there’s room for compromise.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On #2, by contrast, there’s very little room for compromise.  Employers must face real penalties – and refrain completely from discrimination and retaliation – when workers attempt to organize.  The right to organize, remember, is a federally-protected right.  If companies don’t agree with that right, fine.  They can go change the law.  Until that day, they have to provide meaningful protections to those wishing to exercise their federal rights. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Today, though, enforcement is a joke.  The penalties on the books are weak and timid as it is.  But when <em>Republicans</em> run the governing agencies (as they have for the past 8 years), the penalties are effectively nonexistent. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In short, the EFCA is primarily about #2.  It’s fine to water down or get rid of the card check itself, but only <em>only only</em> if there are enforceable penalties and meaningful nondiscrimination requirements. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As for #3, it’s the area I know least about, but there’s less room for compromise here too.  The EFCA includes the binding arbitration requirement because companies often run out the clock to avoid having to negotiate with a certified union.  I’m not sure binding arbitration is the only possible way to get employers to negotiate in good faith, but it’s the best I’ve heard.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As for compromise more generally, I’m not altogether optimistic that it’s possible – largely because it’s hard to believe that companies will ever compromise sufficiently on #2 and #3.  But if compromise on #1 can steel a few Democratic spines (and Specter) and gets us to 60, then that’s fine by me. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Card check legislation, remember, isn’t about the card check.  It’s about correcting employer discrimination and retaliation.  (<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_03/017395.php">Steve Benen has more</a>).
