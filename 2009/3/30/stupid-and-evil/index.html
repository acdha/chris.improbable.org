                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Shortly after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the CIA captured Abu Zubaida, 36, a Palestinian militant who had interacted with a variety of terrorist organizations, including al-Qaida.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Bush administration decided to interrogate Abu Zubaida by employing a series of techniques first developed during the medieval inquisitions for the purpose of coercing false confessions. These techniques were further perfected by regimes like the Soviet Union and North Korea in order to <em>ensure</em> that they were ruthlessly effective at manufacturing false confessions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is the sole function of such techniques. This is what they were designed and refined to do and this is <em>all</em> that they were designed and refined to do. This is what torture is <em>for.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                No surprise, then, that the use of such techniques on Abu Zubaida did exactly what it could be expected to do, the <em>only</em> thing it could be expected to do.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/28/AR2009032802066.html">Peter Finn and Joby Warrick tell the story</a> in <em>The Washington Post</em>:
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-left:40px">
                                When CIA officials subjected their first high-value captive, Abu Zubaida, to water [torture] and other harsh interrogation methods, they were convinced that they had in their custody an al-Qaida leader who knew details of operations yet to be unleashed, and they were facing increasing pressure from the White House to get those secrets out of him.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-left:40px">
                                The methods succeeded in breaking him, and the stories he told of al-Qaida terrorism plots sent CIA officers around the globe chasing leads.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-left:40px">
                                In the end, though, not a single significant plot was foiled as a result of Abu Zubaida's tortured confessions, according to former senior government officials who closely followed the interrogations. Nearly all of the leads attained through the harsh measures quickly evaporated, while most of the useful information from Abu Zubaida -- chiefly names of al-Qaida members and associates -- was obtained before water [torture] was introduced, they said. ...
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-left:40px">
                                The application of techniques such as water [torture] -- a form of [controlled] drowning that U.S. officials had previously deemed a crime -- prompted a sudden torrent of names and facts. Abu Zubaida began unspooling the details of various al-Qaida plots, including plans to unleash weapons of mass destruction.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-left:40px">
                                Abu Zubaida's revelations triggered a series of alerts and sent hundreds of CIA and FBI investigators scurrying in pursuit of phantoms. The interrogations led directly to the arrest of Jose Padilla, the man Abu Zubaida identified as heading an effort to explode a radiological "dirty bomb" in an American city. Padilla was held in a naval brig for 3 1/2 years on the allegation but was never charged in any such plot. Every other lead ultimately dissolved into smoke and shadow, according to high-ranking former U.S. officials with access to classified reports.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-left:40px">
                                "We spent millions of dollars chasing false alarms," one former intelligence official said. ...
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-left:40px">
                                Since 2006, Senate intelligence committee members have pressed the CIA, in classified briefings, to provide examples of specific leads that were obtained from Abu Zubaida through the use of waterboarding and other methods, according to officials familiar with the requests.
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-left:40px">
                                The agency provided none, the officials said.
