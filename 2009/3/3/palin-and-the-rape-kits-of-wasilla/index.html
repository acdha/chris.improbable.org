                        <blockquote>
                            Last September, in the midst of the presidential campaign, a certain Sarah Palin hit the news. And along with her, came the story of how the citizens of Wasilla, Alaska, were charged for rape kits under her administration.
                            <p>
                                This was reported and discussed over at McClatchy newspapers (whose web comments I have the honor to moderate), including these stories/threads: <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/251/story/52266.html">Critics: Under Palin, Wasilla charged rape victims for exam</a> and <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/100/story/52031.html">Anne Kilkenny's e-mail about Sarah Palin</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anyway, in the comment threads on the latter story, we come to this exchange from last September 11/12. I post it here because McClatchy is about to change its software and the archives may (will) be lost:

                                    Wow. One word comes to mind as I read this letter...Lame. Sounds like Palin took Anne's boyfriend away at the senior prom. Seriously, this wreaks of petty jealousy. I for one would be ecstatic if my government refunded a surplus to me, instead of spending it on some misguided program just to get some politicians name on it. Remember, we the people own and run the government..theoretically..so the money is ours if their is a surplus and should be returned to the people. Some politicians like to think it is their's but they are wrong...they are called liberals. A good example is the charge for the rape exam..nothing wrong with it at all. Someone has to pay for the services...and if I or you is rammed in a wreck,no fault of ours,but go to the ER, we have to pay for the medical care. Yes, the rape is horrific, but so is cancer, so is diabetes, Lupus, etc,etc....when will you people stop thinking that the government has to pay for everything and take of us? Get out there and do a little work. There once was a liberal young daughter who hounded her old conservative father. He calmly later asked his daughter about her college classes. She responded how tough they were and how she was having to bust her butt to make an A. That she had no free time. He asked how her friend Sally was doing and she responded having a great college life but making terrible grades. Her Dad said well that's horrible...I think you should go to your teachers and ask if you could give some of your good grades to Sally,maybe even average your grades to help her out. His daughter was outraged...stated are you crazy, I've worked hard for those grades,no way am I giving her anything - she's goofing off and having fun and I'm busting my tail every day....her father smiled and said.... well,well, my dear..welcome to the Republican Party!

                                    </p>

                                        "Nothing wrong with it at all"? There's a great deal wrong with it. A rape exam isn't a health-care procedure. It's a police investigative technique. When you get rammed in a wreck the police don't send you a bill for the time they spent measuring tire marks on the pavement, or for the lab costs of the drug-and-alcohol screens they did on you, nor for the photographs they took of the scene.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Law enforcement and justice are public; and law enforcement and justice must be paid for from public funds.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Forcing the victims to pay for the police investigation is not only immoral, it is also (very likely) illegal. When someone is burglarized do the police say, "Sorry, not going to investigate this if you can't pay for the fingerprint powder." (And good luck getting your homeowners' insurance to pay for the policework.)

                                            Apparently Mr McDonald is some expert on rape exams...according to him. I'll grant him that one aspect is legal or procedural...but an equally important aspect is the medical exam for injury or psychologic damage. How do I know this..I've done it..it's called a Rape kit in many ER's ..I'm a gynecologist and I've done them. Please refrain from addressing topics that you know little about..that's what's wrong with internet blogs...people speak as authorities and usually have an extremely limited fund of knowledge...its a typical left wing tactic also..

                                    Well, I'm going to beg the indulgence of the good people here to go a bit off-topic and tell you, at some length, about rape kits.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I have a rape kit right here. Let's look at it...
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The first thing I notice is that its official name, printed right on the cover of the box, is "Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit." Hmmm... nothing there about patient care or treatment. "Evidence Collection" sounds more like a police function. Let's open it up and see what's inside.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Hmmm. A number of paper bags and some instruction sheets. No bandages, no sutures, no antibiotics....
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step one is the authorization for collection and release/transfer of evidence and protected health information form. That's a paperwork drill. It gets the patient's name, date of birth, the date of the exam, and permission to collect the evidence. It says "Evidence" right on the form. This resembles healthcare only in that healthcare requires similar information and permissions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step two. Sexual assault evidence collection kit inventory. A list of what's in the kit, with checkmarks for "Collected" and "Not Collected." What's interesting here is line 11, "Additional evidence (Please list)." Evidence. Still no health care.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step three. Sexual assault medical/forensic report form. Patient identifying information, then check boxes: "Indicate by checking the appropriate box what the patient has done since the assault (if unsure, please state the reason why) Douched; Yes, no, unsure. Bathed/showered; Yes, no, unsure. Urinated; Yes, no, unsure." And so on. Then: "At the time of assault was: A condom used by the assailant? Yes, no, unsure. Patient menstruating? Yes, no, unsure. ... Weapon used/threatened by assailant? Yes, no, unsure." And so on. "Within the past five days has the patient engaged in consensual sexual activity? Yes, no." And so on. Then: "Details of the assault (check all that apply): Penile/oral, penile/genital, penile/anal, digital/genital.... " And so on. "Describe any pertinent details of the assault." Fill in the blank.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step four. Liquid blood sample. An envelope with a foam-padded insert for blood tubes. Additional blood and urine samples are required if a suspected drug-facilitated sexual assault occurred. The tubes are sealed in the provided envelope. Not too useful for patient care, sealed like that, is it? "Note: In order to minimize patient discomfort, blood needed for other tests, including pregnancy, should be drawn at this time. THESE TEST RESULTS SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN KIT, BUT SHOULD REMAIN AT THE HOSPITAL." In other words, the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit is separate from health care requirements.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step five: Paper bags for collecting the victim's outer clothing. "If patient changed clothing after assault, inform officer in charge so that the clothing worn at the time of the assault may be collected by the police." How's that related to patient care, Doctor?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step six: A paper bag labeled "Underpants." "Collect in all instances. If patient not wearing underpants, collect item of clothing that had contact with the patient's genitalia." How's that related to patient care?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step seven: Oral swabs and smear. The smear is allowed to air dry and sealed in the provided envelope. Not too useful for patient care, eh, Doctor?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step eight: Foreign material collection. Remove folded sheet from Foreign Material Collection envelope. Unfold and place on flat surface. Collect any foreign material such as dirt, leaves, fiber, hair, etc. (found on body) and place in center of paper. Then refold paper in manner to retain material.... Note location from which sample(s) was taken on anatomical drawings on envelope. Seal and fill out all information requested on envelope." How's that related to patient care, Doctor?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step nine: Rectal swabs and smear. "Return smear and swabs to Rectal Swabs and Smear envelope. Seal and fill out all information requested on envelope." How's that related to patient care, Doctor?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step ten: Pubic hair combings. "...remove paper towel and comb provided in Pubic Hair Combings envelope. Place towel under patient's buttocks. Using comb provided, comb pubic hair in downward strokes so that any loose hairs and/or debris will fall onto paper towel. Refold paper towel in manner to retain both comb and any evidence present...." Evidence. What part does this step play in health care, Doctor?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step eleven: External genital swabs. "If cunnilingus or fellatio was performed on the patient within five days of the exam, and the patient has not bathed/showered, or the patient is pre-pubertal...." Again, the swabs and smears are sealed and not otherwise used at the hospital. How is that related to patient care, Doctor? Is there a step in healthcare that you wouldn't perform if the patient had bathed recently?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step twelve: This is the one you'd actually be involved in as a gynecologist, Doctor. Vaginal swabs and smear. "Note: Any other examination of and testing of the ano-genital and pelvic area should occur simultaneously with this step." I think you're the "any other examination."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step thirteen: Medical/forensic examination form. "Physical examination: Was patient bleeding from wounds sustained during the assault? Yes, no. Were photographs taken by examiner? Yes, no, how many? Digital, Instant, Colposcope, Film, Other. Was Medical Examiner consulted? Yes, no." And so on. Paperwork. This resembles documentation that would be produced in a health care setting.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step fourteen: Patient information form. "With your consent, the following tests were completed (check all that apply): Blood test for syphilis, pregnancy test, blood test for Hepatitis B, ..." Finally, something related to health care! "At the time of your evaluation, specimens were obtained in order to look for suspected drug-facilitated sexual assault. The specimens are not evaluated by the hospital laboratory, but forwarded to the State Police Forensic Laboratory. Information regarding the results should be obtained through the investigating law enforcement agency...."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Okay... here's the part that tells me why Palin didn't want the town of Wasilla to pay for rape kits:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step fifteen: Emergency Pregnancy Prevention. "Fill out all information requested on form. Give one copy to patient. Retain one copy for hospital records." Yes, part of the rape kit is offering the so-called "morning after pill." That's contraception! We can't have taxpayers paying for contraception! Contraception is wrong!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step sixteen: Photographs. "If photographs are indicated follow the guidelines outlined in the Protocol."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Last step!
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Step seventeen: Postcard. A stamped, addressed postcard to tell the state crime lab that that kit is coming: "Please complete the information on the enclosed stamped postcard and put it in the mail."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "Final instructions:"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After telling the examiner to place all materials (except bags containing outer clothing and underpants) back into the original box, "Hand sealed kit, sealed bags and appropriate forms to investigating officer, and obtain your signature as well as that of law enforcement to ensure chain of custody requirements have been met."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Law enforcement officer. Chain of custody. Tell me, Doctor, what's that have to do with health care? Isn't that an evidence gathering procedure? "I'll grant him that one aspect is legal or procedural..." How about "all but one or two aspects are legal or procedural"?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "Note: The kit needs to be picked up by Law Enforcement in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred, unless otherwise arranged by the law enforcement agency. If officer is not present at this time, place sealed kit and bags in secure and refrigerated area, and hold for pick up by law enforcement."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That's what a rape kit is, Doctor.
                                </p>
                                <p>
