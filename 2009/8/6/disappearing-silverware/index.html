                                    It looks like the <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/32">summary attribute issue</a> is finally well on its way to being closed.&nbsp; Recent events: <a href="http://john.foliot.ca/talismans-active-listening-and-a-half-time-show/">John’s position</a>, <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0241.html">Ian’s position</a>, <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0276.html">Maciej’s mediation</a>, <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0282.html">Ian’s acceptance</a>, <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0286.html">John’s withdrawal of his draft</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One of the key take-away’s from all this is something Maciej said: <em>The most effective way, I believe, is to actively encourage a constructive alternative</em>.&nbsp; In general, blocking the work of others is something I plan to discourage.&nbsp; If that ends up making HTML5 more like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">Perl</a> than Python, so be it.&nbsp; After all, those that <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#a_dtd_XHTML-1.0-Strict">prefer rigid alternatives</a> still have that option.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <a href="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2009/07/11/Vendor-Veto">Previously</a> I said that there may be as many as four drafts by the end of the last month.&nbsp; Here we are in August, and we are still holding at one draft.&nbsp; I firmly believe that enabling forks is the best way to prevent such.&nbsp; The clearest explanation I have ever heard as to why that premise applies so well in the context of spec writing was made by Joe Gregorio: <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/Camera_Ready_Copy_and_the_Social_Denial_of_Service_Attack">Camera-Ready Copy and the Social Denial-of-Service Attack</a>.&nbsp; My experience is that people tend to become reasonable (or at least throttle down the urge to be unreasonable) if you set the expectation that they need to make a concrete and constructive proposal.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Accordingly, I plan to continue enabling such potential forks in the hopes that doing so will end up facilitating the amicable resolution of issues.&nbsp; During the course of this discussion, I was able to assist a number of people with the preparation of their text for publishing, even though none actually got published.&nbsp; The remainder of this post is about that process.
                                </p>

                                    The W3C uses cvs.&nbsp; The WHATWG, subversion.&nbsp; Anolis uses mercurial.&nbsp; Manu, git.&nbsp; I happen to have each installed already, so none of this is a problem for me, but I can see how it is intimidating.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I’ve looked at <a href="http://wiki.github.com/html5/spec">Manu’s build system</a>, and despite the pretty pictures, I have to say that I don’t quite grok the approach.&nbsp; I’m familiar enough with the tools that I see how it all works mechanically: it is the overall approach that seems to me to be problematic.&nbsp; The <a href="http://github.com/html5/spec/blob/187162b6dd55ffb78d0b7233bdca567ed4362ab8/README">README</a> tells you how to build Manu’s draft, but not how to create your own.&nbsp; From what I can figure out, in order to create a new draft you need to create a <a href="http://github.com/html5/spec/blob/187162b6dd55ffb78d0b7233bdca567ed4362ab8/configs/html5-rdfa.conf">configuration file</a> listing all the sections you want (adding and removing as you see fit) and modify a <a href="http://github.com/html5/spec/blob/187162b6dd55ffb78d0b7233bdca567ed4362ab8/Makefile.in">make file</a>.&nbsp; If you want to make a one line change to a section, you need to <a href="http://github.com/html5/spec/tree/187162b6dd55ffb78d0b7233bdca567ed4362ab8/microsections">snapshot that section</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What happens if Ian adds a section or modifies one of the sections you snapshotted?&nbsp; Unless I’m missing something, you need to detect this yourself and merge.&nbsp; I’m sure this can be automated above the level of the configuration management system, but isn’t that what the CM system itself is good for?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I’m sure that <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Aug/0165.html">Manu will solve these issues</a>, but for the moment, I’ve been taking a more direct route.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Recently, a few members of the PF Working Group sent me an updated draft based on Maciej’s suggestions.&nbsp; All they did was to take <a href="http://svn.whatwg.org/webapps/source">Ian’s latest source</a>, edit it using the editor of their choice, and send it to me.&nbsp; That editor made a number of changes: specifically it added a BOM, a minimal html head section, wrapped the content in a body, closed the body and html tags at the end, and converted Unix style LF into DOS style CRLFs.&nbsp; Sounds like a lot, but essentially the content in the middle was intact: neither a quote nor a slash was added in the process to sections that weren’t changed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My workflow was simple.&nbsp; I manage the <a href="http://code.intertwingly.net/public/git/?p=webapps;a=summary">source in git</a>.&nbsp; I manage the documents produced using the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/html5/">W3C’s cvs</a>.&nbsp; And to produce the output from the source, I use the <a href="http://anolis.gsnedders.com/">Anolis</a> tool created by Geoffrey Snedders and a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5/source/browse/trunk/spec-splitter/spec-splitter.py">spec splitter</a> script originally developed by Philip Taylor.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For the input, I created a branch named “summary_compromise”, and placed the file I received there, over top of the file named <code>source</code>.&nbsp; The only thing I needed to be careful of was to first checkout the same version of the source that they had used has their base, that way the internal deltas will be correct.&nbsp; I then used <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DosToUnix">dostounix</a> to get rid of the pesky CR’s, and <code>git add --patch</code> to identify which “hunks” to commit (I omitted the front matter and back matter, and accepted the rest).&nbsp; Once I was done, I committed the result.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I can even apply Ian’s subsequent changes via a <code>git rebase master</code>.&nbsp; What happens if Ian adds a section?&nbsp; Not a problem.&nbsp; Or if Ian removes a section other than the one the PF group modified?&nbsp; Not a problem.&nbsp; What if Ian modifies different lines in the same section?&nbsp; Again not a problem.&nbsp; What if Ian modifies or removes a line that the PF group modified or removed?&nbsp; Then and only then a merge would be required, but even there, git has tools to assist with this.&nbsp; Fetching, rebasing or merging with a branch from Manu or anybody else would be equally as straightforward.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As to the processing, what’s required is that you start with a <a href="http://github.com/html5/spec/blob/187162b6dd55ffb78d0b7233bdca567ed4362ab8/headers/header-w3c-html5">standard W3C header</a> (modifying the date), append the source and pass the result to Anolis with a few options.&nbsp; I was only able to find the options and header in Manu’s repository, so I went with those.&nbsp; To make things easier for me, I created a <a href="http://intertwingly.net/stories/2009/08/06/html5spec">small script</a> and <a href="http://intertwingly.net/stories/2009/08/06/html5spec.cfg">configuration file</a> which enables me to do all this with one command: all I need to specify is the name of the branch.&nbsp; The script even calls <code>spec-splitter.py</code> on the result to split the large file into smaller sections.&nbsp; Committing the output to CVS would have been sufficient to trigger publishing on the W3C web site, but as I said, in this case I never had to get to this point.&nbsp; In fact, I never published my local commits to any public git repository.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While I am glad to help out, longer term I have zero interest in becoming indispensable in this way or establishing and retaining a position in the critical path for publishing.&nbsp; I will help anybody out there who is capable of finding the command line and installing Anolis on their machine through the rest.
                                </p>
