                                    Archaeoastronomy has been a <a href="http://gamblershouse.wordpress.com/2008/12/21/the-day-the-sun-stands-still/">major research topic</a> at Chaco Canyon for a long time, especially since the discovery of the “Sun Dagger” petroglyph atop Fajada Butte in 1977.  While the Sun Dagger is the best-known proposed astronomical marker in the canyon, many others have been suggested in the years since its discovery.  These have been accepted as valid by the archaeological community to varying degrees; the Sun Dagger is among the most widely accepted, but many others, particularly those identified by Anna Sofaer’s <a href="http://www.solsticeproject.org/">Solstice Project</a>, have met with much more skepticism.

                                    The root of much of this skepticism lies in a fundamental difficulty with archaeoastronomical research.  Basically, there’s usually no way to prove that a given alignment was intentional rather than coincidental.  If you draw enough lines something is bound to line up, so the risk of a proposed alignment being coincidental is always there, and there’s no sure way to demonstrate that coincidence is not the explanation, at least when dealing with prehistoric cultures lacking writing systems.  The main way these alignments become accepted, then, is by demonstration of various qualities of them that are unlikely to be coincidental.  These can include the precision of the alignment, as at the north-south and east-west walls at <a href="http://gamblershouse.wordpress.com/2008/12/31/a-virtual-tour-of-pueblo-bonito/">Pueblo Bonito</a>, the way the alignment sheds light on other puzzling aspects of the site, as at <a href="http://gamblershouse.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/chimney-rock/">Chimney Rock</a>, or the combination of multiple alignments in a single marker, as at the Sun Dagger.  The more of these other lines of evidence for intentionality there are, the more likely it is that the alignment is intentional rather than coincidental, but coincidence can never be completely ruled out.

                                    A good example of the role of coincidence in archaeoastronomy comes in a <a href="http://gamblershouse.wordpress.com/reading-list/#reyman1978">short article</a> by Jonathan Reyman, one of the pioneers of archaeoastronomical research <a href="http://gamblershouse.wordpress.com/reading-list/#reyman1976">at Chaco</a> and elsewhere, reporting on some research he did on an alignment at <a href="http://www.nps.gov/wupa/">Wupatki</a> that turned out to be completely coincidental and spurious.  While it is usually not possible to show that an alignment is definitely coincidental, much as it is impossible to show that it is definitely intentional, in this case it happened to be quite clear.

                                    What happened was that Reyman and his crew arrived at Wupatki, intending to test the alignment of a window in the east wall of Room 44 at Wupatki Pueblo.  This room was unusual in several respects, which led Reyman to believe that it might have had astronomical functions.  It is high in the building, which afforded it good visibility, it has a t-shaped doorway in its south wall, it has a window in the east wall, which is very unusual at Wupatki, where there are few windows, and its floor is paved with flagstones, also very unusual.  In addition, Room 44 contained bins with unusual artifact assemblages found during excavation, and one of the bins had two macaw skeletons in it.  All of this made Room 44 a plausible candidate for a sunrise alignment marker of some sort, so Reyman and his team made arrangements to come to Wupatki in the summer of 1976 to do some measurements.

                                    When they arrived at the monument, they looked through documentation on the site, which has been excavated and substantially rebuilt.  Unfortunately, most of the pertinent documentation was out on loan, so they couldn’t look through everything, but what they did have available seemed to show that Room 44 was in basically the same condition it had been in when it was excavated in 1933.  So they did their measurements and found that the window did indeed have alignments to the sunrises on the summer and winter solstices as well as on the equinoxes.  Success!

                                    The very next day, however, the documentation that had been out on loan was returned to the monument, and when Reyman looked at it he realized that his results were totally spurious.  It turned out that Room 44 had been almost completely reconstructed in the 1930s.  When it was first excavated, only the northwest corner was still in place, and the rest of the walls had been reduced almost completely to the floor level.  After excavation, the Park Service decided to turn this part of the site into a ranger station and museum, so they rebuilt the walls entirely, added a door in the south wall and a window in the east wall, put on a roof, and paved the floor, which was originally clay, with flagstones.  Later, when a separate headquarters for the monument was built, the Park Service dissassembled some but not all of this reconstruction, including the roof and the upper parts of the walls, but left the paved floor and the window and doorway in place for some reason, and they remained in place when Reyman arrived in 1976.  Since it was very unlikely that the Park Service and the Museum of Northern Arizona, which did the reconstruction in the 1930s, intended to put in alignments to the solstice and equinox sunrises when they built the window in Room 44, Reyman was forced to conclude that it was all just a coincidence and that there was no evidence that Room 44 ever had any astronomical alignments (or, for that matter, any windows or doorways).

                                    Despite the disappointing nature of this exercise, Reyman decided to publish his account of it anyway, as a cautionary tale for would-be archaeoastronomers.  Many of the prehistoric sites in the southwest, especially those managed by the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/">National Park Service</a>, have been substantially reconstructed, and it’s very important to check the documentation of that reconstruction before taking any measurements to make sure that there is actually something original there to measure.
