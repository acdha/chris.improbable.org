                                <p>
                                    I really want health care reform to be enacted, so I’m going to keep talking about it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Last week Whole Foods CEO John Mackey wrote an <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204251404574342170072865070.html">inflammatory op-ed</a> about health care reform for the Wall Street Journal. He’s posted the <a href="http://www2.wholefoodsmarket.com/blogs/jmackey/2009/08/14/health-care-reform-full-article/">unedited version</a> on his own blog, and notes that he didn’t come up with the headline that appeared in the paper. Starting out with a quote warning of the dangers of socialism from Margaret Thatcher, who never tried to dismantle Britain’s completely socialized health care system, was his own choice. Radley Balko says it’s dumb to <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/2009/08/15/whole-foods-2/">boycott Whole Foods</a> even if you’re irritated by Mackey’s op-ed.
                                </p>

                                    Speaking of op-eds, Barack Obama laid out his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/opinion/16obama.html?_r=1">case for reform</a> in the New York Times. It’s a written version of the opening comments he’s been making at town halls for the past week.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Nate Silver says the public option is <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/08/life-after-death-of-public-option.html">probably dead</a>. For people who aren’t obsessed with the health care debate, the public option is the proposed government-run insurance company that individuals would be able to use if they prefer it to any of the options offered by private insurance companies. Silver explains why the public option is probably dead and what it means — it’s a must-read piece.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Republicans keep making the point that what we really need is easing of regulations that prohibit health insurance companies from operating across state lines. For example, here’s what John Mackey says:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>
                                        Repeal all state laws which prevent insurance companies from competing across state lines. We should all have the legal right to purchase health insurance from any insurance company in any state and we should be able use that health insurance wherever we live. Health insurance should be portable everywhere.
                                    </p>
                                </blockquote>

                                    Anyone seen any data driven analysis that predicts what the effects of this would be? I’ve seen a lot of reference to it, and it seems to make sense, but I’ve only seen the assertion that this would be good and that it would make a significant difference, not any arguments that bear it out. I still haven’t seen any arguments from the anti-reform camp that deal with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection">adverse selection</a> issue.
                                </p>

                                    Tyler Cowen says that our health care debate in the US is going to make it more difficult for the UK to <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/08/path-dependence-of-health-care-institutions.html">improve</a> its health care system.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Update: Here’s a <a href="http://www.donkeylicious.com/2009/08/flowchart.html">very simple flow chart</a> that lays out how the reform plan is intended to work. Pass it around.
