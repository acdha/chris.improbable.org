                                        So it seems that we arenâ€™t going to have a second Great Depression after all. What saved us? The answer, basically, is Big Government.&nbsp; . . .&nbsp;&nbsp; All in all, then, the government has played a crucial stabilizing role in this economic crisis. Ronald Reagan was wrong: sometimes the private sector is the problem, and government is the solution.
                                    </p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    One of the long-term challenges for progressives is to rehabilitate the <em>idea</em> of government.&nbsp; To achieve this goal, however, the public needs to see all the ways that government benefits them <em>personally</em>.&nbsp; After all, that's why progressives are progressives.&nbsp; We think the way we do because we think government can play (and has played) an extremely valuable role in people's lives.&nbsp; Otherwise, I wouldn't writing this, and you wouldn't be reading it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The problem, though, is that the benefits of government quickly become invisible.&nbsp; People benefit from government, but don't always realize that <em>political struggles</em> made those benefits possible.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That's why the Laffer quote was so unintentionally revealing.&nbsp; I'm sure Arthur Laffer knows that Medicare is a government program.&nbsp; But the reason why that fact probably slipped his mind for a second is because Medicare has become <em>so</em> interwoven into the fabric of everyday life that it's assumed to be part of the natural order.&nbsp; That's why you hear <a href="http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/pagespage/2009/08/medicare-fantasies.html">stories of people saying</a>, "Keep government out of my Medicare."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But that's just one example.&nbsp; Life is full of invisible examples of government benefits we never think about.&nbsp; The free market didn't bring about the weekend, or clean air.&nbsp; It didn't create universal education, and neither did it provide universal health care for the elderly.&nbsp; It didn't desegregate our schools.&nbsp; It couldn't save the banking system -- there was a series of interventions that kept it from collapsing and got it back on its feet.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But all these things quickly fade into the background like an invisible platform.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That's why I sometimes wish life had a show/hide function similar to the one in Word that shows or hides formatting.&nbsp; We could click it, and reveal all the ways that political choices have improved our lives.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Of course, government isn't always good -- see, e.g., sugar subsidies, spectrum regulation.&nbsp; And markets do many things very, very well.&nbsp; But the demagoguery that the <em>idea</em> of government is receiving in the health coverage debate is completely undeserved.&nbsp;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But it's hard to convince skeptical people otherwise until they are persuaded to change their visceral underlying hostility to the idea of government.&nbsp; Showing them all the benefits they receive can hopefully help on that front.
                                </p>
