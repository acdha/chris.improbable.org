                                        So it seems that we aren’t going to have a second Great Depression after all. What saved us? The answer, basically, is Big Government.  . . .   All in all, then, the government has played a crucial stabilizing role in this economic crisis. Ronald Reagan was wrong: sometimes the private sector is the problem, and government is the solution.
                                    </p>

                                    One of the long-term challenges for progressives is to rehabilitate the <em>idea</em> of government.  To achieve this goal, however, the public needs to see all the ways that government benefits them <em>personally</em>.  After all, that's why progressives are progressives.  We think the way we do because we think government can play (and has played) an extremely valuable role in people's lives.  Otherwise, I wouldn't writing this, and you wouldn't be reading it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The problem, though, is that the benefits of government quickly become invisible.  People benefit from government, but don't always realize that <em>political struggles</em> made those benefits possible.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That's why the Laffer quote was so unintentionally revealing.  I'm sure Arthur Laffer knows that Medicare is a government program.  But the reason why that fact probably slipped his mind for a second is because Medicare has become <em>so</em> interwoven into the fabric of everyday life that it's assumed to be part of the natural order.  That's why you hear <a href="http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/pagespage/2009/08/medicare-fantasies.html">stories of people saying</a>, "Keep government out of my Medicare."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But that's just one example.  Life is full of invisible examples of government benefits we never think about.  The free market didn't bring about the weekend, or clean air.  It didn't create universal education, and neither did it provide universal health care for the elderly.  It didn't desegregate our schools.  It couldn't save the banking system -- there was a series of interventions that kept it from collapsing and got it back on its feet. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But all these things quickly fade into the background like an invisible platform.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That's why I sometimes wish life had a show/hide function similar to the one in Word that shows or hides formatting.  We could click it, and reveal all the ways that political choices have improved our lives.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Of course, government isn't always good -- see, e.g., sugar subsidies, spectrum regulation.  And markets do many things very, very well.  But the demagoguery that the <em>idea</em> of government is receiving in the health coverage debate is completely undeserved. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But it's hard to convince skeptical people otherwise until they are persuaded to change their visceral underlying hostility to the idea of government.  Showing them all the benefits they receive can hopefully help on that front.
