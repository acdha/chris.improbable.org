                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <strong>It sounds like a communist utopia, but a basic income program pioneered by German aid workers has helped alleviate poverty in a Nambian village. Crime is down and children can finally attend school. Only the local white farmers are unhappy.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The full, red Namibian sun is setting outside his living room window, the workers are returning to their corrugated metal huts, and Siggi von L端ttwitz is hitting a wooden table with the palm of his hand to explain why the experiment cannot work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "They all drink, you know," he says, smoking an unfiltered cigarette, "and if you give them 100 dollars, they'll just drink more." By "they" L端ttwitz means the people of Otjivero, a settlement adjacent to his farmland. And by "they" he means people who are poor and black.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                L端ttwitz, a Namibian of German descent, is a farmer. He is sitting at his dining table, which is covered with wax cloth. A calendar of prize bulls is on the wall. "Stealing, having children, that's what it's like here."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He pays his workers, his "cadets," the minimum hourly wage of 2.21 Namibian dollars, which is about 20 euro cents, as well as rations of meat and milk, which he believes is sufficient. He knows that the people in Otjivero are hungry. "They're poor wretches," he says, "and in some ways I feel sorry for them." But giving them money? "An idiotic idea," says L端ttwitz, insisting that it isn't the right way to teach them to be hardworking.
                            </p>
