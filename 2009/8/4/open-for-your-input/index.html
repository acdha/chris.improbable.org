We further note that Section 508 regulations apply to U.S. state and local governments, and that similar accessibility requirements are emerging in Canada, the U.K., the E.U., Australia, and elsewhere.

                                    As far as I can tell this concern is unfounded; the &lt;caption&gt; attribute is in fact encouraged by the very same government (as quoted above) to be used exactly as HTML5 recommends in a manner consistent with the goals of the summary=”" attribute.

                                    For tables that consist of more than just a grid of cells with headers in the first row and headers in the first column, and for any table in general where the reader might have difficulty understanding the content, authors should include explanatory information introducing the table. This information is useful for all users, but is especially useful for users who cannot see the table, e.g. users of screen readers.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Such explanatory information should introduce the purpose of the table, outline its basic cell structure, highlight any trends or patterns, and generally teach the user how to use the table.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are a variety of ways to include this information, such as:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In prose, surrounding the table
                                    </li>
                                    <li>In the table’s caption
                                    </li>
                                    <li>In the table’s caption, in a details element
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Next to the table, in the same figure
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Next to the table, in a figure’s legend
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    Authors may also use other techniques, or combinations of the above techniques, as appropriate.

                                <p>
                                    If a table element has a summary attribute, the user agent may report the contents of that attribute to the user.

                                    I maintain that it is not the role of the HTML WG, and the editor in particular, to be offering this guidance, especially when it contradicts the consensus position of the W3C Group chartered to speak on web accessibility issues. Simply put, you are messing in somebody else’s yard, and it is against W3C process to be doing so. If HTML WG feel that they have compelling evidence and data that suggests that the WCAG guidance needs to be reviewed and revised, there is a process for that.

                                    The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group [part of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)] is the worst committee, group, company, or organization I’ve ever worked with. Several of my friends and I were variously ignored; threatened with ejection from the group or actually ejected; and actively harassed.

                                    I have submitted an alternative [HTML 5] Draft document for consideration; one which I believe rightly returns the role of author guidance for creating accessible content to the W3C WAI – the group officially chartered by the W3C to speak to these matters. It is a question of respect.

                                    Are you saying that for you, it is more important that HTML5 not contradict other W3C specifications, than it be that HTML5 address accessibility problems with the HTML language?

                                    Contradictory information *harms* the overall outreach aspect of teaching people how to create accessible web content, and I speak from the position of one who actually does that for a living, and have been doing so for close to a decade. THE MESSAGE WE SEND TO THE WORLD’S WEB DEVELOPERS MUST BE CONSISTENT!

                                    Has that group weighed in in this debate, in response to the evidence presented? Or is it just that an out-of-date (i.e., not updated in response to newer evidence) recommendation of that group is being cited?
