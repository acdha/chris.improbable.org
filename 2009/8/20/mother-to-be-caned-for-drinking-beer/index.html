                                Mother of two set to become first woman to be flogged under the country's Islamic law
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A Muslim model will receive six strokes from a rattan cane after admitting in an Islamic court to the crime of drinking beer in a bar.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno, 32, said todaythat she asked Malaysian authorities to punish her in public instead of in a prison, but they refused to go against official procedures.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Shukarno, 32, is scheduled to be the first woman in this Muslim-majority country to be flogged under Islamic law after she was arrested in a raid and sentenced by a sharia court for drinking alcohol at a hotel lounge last year.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "I want to send a message that I really regret what I did, so I want to be punished in front of other people," Kartika said in a telephone interview from her northern home state of Perak. "If other Muslims can see me being caned, I hope it will convince them not to drink."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The news of her impending punishment comes just weeks after the case of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/aug/02/sudan-women-dress-code" title="Lubna Hussein">Lubna Hussein</a>, a Sudanese woman who faces 40 lashes for wearing trousers in public, in what has become a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/aug/04/sudan-woman-trousers-court" title="public test of Sudan's indecency laws">public test of Sudan's indecency laws</a>. Hussein, a former journalist and UN press officer, was arrested with 12 other women during a party at a Khartoum restaurant in July and charged with being indecently dressed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Kartika said prison officials turned down her request today, saying she will be lashed six times with a rattan cane without any public witnesses sometime early next week.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Authorities have insisted Kartika will not feel much physical pain because the rattan cane will be smaller and lighter than the one for men, and its purpose was to "educate" rather than punish.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Her penalty has led to criticism by some politicians and women's rights activists who say it is still too harsh. The law provides for a three-year prison term and caning for Muslims caught drinking, but most offenders are fined. Drinking is legal for non-Muslims.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Kartika said officials indicated she might have to stay inside the prison for several days ahead of the caning, but she will be separated from the regular inmates.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "I feel relieved. I was not afraid of the caning, but I was afraid of the environment in the prison. Now they said they will make me comfortable, so I'm satisfied," she said, adding thatshe had explained the matter to her seven-year-old son and five-year-old daughter.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "They both don't really understand, but my daughter told me, 'Mama, you must be strong.' Now I feel brave but sad that this is not only a punishment for me but for my family," she said.
