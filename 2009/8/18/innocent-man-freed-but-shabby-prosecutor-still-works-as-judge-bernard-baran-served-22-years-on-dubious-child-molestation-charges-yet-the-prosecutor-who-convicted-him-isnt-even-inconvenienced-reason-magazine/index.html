                        <blockquote>
                            Baran was convicted in January 1985 of molesting six children at a pre-Kindergarten daycare facility in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He was released on bond in 2006 after <a href="http://www.freebaran.org/Appeals%20Court%20Decision.pdf">an appeals court determined</a> [PDF] that his trial attorney had been incompetent and that the prosecution may have withheld key exculpatory evidence. Baran says that during his jail term he was raped and beaten more than 30 times, necessitating six different transfers to new correctional institutions. Such is the cost the prison system exacts on an openly gay man convicted of molesting children.<br>
                            <br>
                            Baran was one of the first people in the country to be prosecuted in the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/fuster/lessons/outcomes.html">daycare sex abuse panic</a> of the 1980s, a bizarre, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMartin_preschool_trial">nationwide hysteria</a> fed by fears of satanism, homophobia, and a wing of child psychology that used unproven <a href="http://www.kspope.com/memory/memory.php">interrogation techniques</a> critics say caused children to recount sexual incidents that <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110003414">never took place</a>.<br>
                            <br>
                            While Baran's case has been covered extensively <a href="http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/03917095.asp">i</a><a href="http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/03917095.asp">n</a><a href="http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/03917095.asp">Massachusetts</a>, and recently in the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32341725/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/">national media</a>, one aspect of it still hasn't really been examined. Prosecutor Daniel Ford likely engaged in serious misconduct and open bigotry in winning his conviction of Baran. Yet in 25 years, Ford has never been investigated or disciplined for his role in the case. And since 1989, Ford has sat as a judge on the Massachusetts Superior Court. Ford's career trajectory and lack of accountability is the far too familiar product of the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/chi-020103trial5,0,741495.story">backward incentive stru</a><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/chi-020103trial5,0,741495.story">cture</a> that prosecutors work under. Convictions produce rewards, while abuse rarely comes with a penalty.
