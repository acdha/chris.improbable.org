                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                One sentiment I've seen in a number of people express about our release of <a href="https://www.recapthelaw.org/">RECAP</a> is illustrated by <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/harlanyu/introducing-recap-turning-pacer-around#comment-108833">this comment</a> here at Freedom to Tinker:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Technically impressive, but also shortsighted. There appears a socialistic cultural trend that seeks to disconnect individual accountability to ones choices. $.08 a page is hardly burdensome or profitable, and clearly goes to offset costs. If additional taxes are required to make up the shortfall RECAP seems likely to create, we all will pay more in general taxes even though only a small few ever access PACER.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, I don't think anyone who's familiar with <a href="http://www.cato.org/people/timothy-lee">my work</a> would accuse me of harboring socialistic sympathies. RECAP has earned the endorsement of my colleague <a href="http://www.cato.org/people/jim-harper">Jim Harper</a> of the libertarian Cato Institute and <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/orprojfaq.shtml">Christopher Farrell</a> of the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch. Those guys are not socialists.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Still, there's a fair question here: under the model we advocate, taxpayers might wind up picking up some of the costs currently being bourne by PACER users. Why should taxpayers in general pay for a service that only a tiny fraction of the population will ever use?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I think there are two answers. The narrow answer is that this misunderstands where the costs of PACER come from. There are four distinct steps in the process of publishing a judicial record. First, someone has to create the document. This is done by a judge in some cases and by private litigants in others. Second, someone has to convert the document to electronic format. This is a small and falling cost, because both judges and litigants increasingly produce documents using word processors, so they're digital from their inception. Third, someone has to redact the documents to ensure private information doesn't leak out. This is supposed to be done by private parties when they submit documents, but they don't always do what they're supposed to, necessitating extra work by court personnel. Finally, the documents need to be uploaded to a website where they can be downloaded by the public.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The key thing to understand here is that the first three steps are things that the courts would be doing anyway if PACER didn't exist. Court documents were already public records before PACER came onto the scene. Anyone could (and still can) drive down to the courthouse, request any unsealed document they want, and make as many photocopies as they wish. Moreover, even if documents weren't public, the courts would likely still be transitioning to an electronic system for their internal use.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So this means that the only additional cost of PACER, beyond the activities the courts would be doing anyway, is the web servers, bandwidth, and personnel required to run the PACER web sites themselves. But RECAP users imposes no additional load on PACER's servers. Users download RECAP documents directly from the Internet Archive. So RECAP is entirely consistent with the principle that PACER users should pay for the resources they use.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I think there's also a deeper answer to this question, which is that it misunderstands the role of the judiciary in a free society. The service the judiciary provides to the public is not the production of individual documents or even the resolution of individual cases. The service it provides is the maintenance of a comprehensive and predictable system of law that is the foundation for our civilization. You benefit from this system whether or not you ever appear in court because it gives you confidence that your rights will be protected in a fair and predictable manner. And in particular, you benefit from judicial transparency because transparency improves accountability. Even if you're not personally interested in monitoring the judiciary for abuses, you benefit when other people do so.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is something I take personally because I've <a href="http://arstechnica.com/authors/timothy-b-lee/">done a bit of legal reporting</a> myself. I obviously get some direct benefits from doing thisâ€”I sometimes get paid and it's always fun to have people read my work. But I like to think that my writing about the law also benefits society at large by increasing public understanding and scrutiny of the judicial system. And charging for access to the law will be most discouraging to people like me who are trying to do more than just win a particular court case. Journalists, public interest advocates, academics, and the like generally don't have clients they can bill for the expense of legal research, so PACER fees are a significant barrier.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There's no conflict between a belief in free markets and a belief that everyone is entitled to information about the legal system that governs their lives. To the contrary, free markets depend on the "rules of the game" being fair and predictable. The kind of judicial transparency that RECAP hopes to foster only furthers that goal.
