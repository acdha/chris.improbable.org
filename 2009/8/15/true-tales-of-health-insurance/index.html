                            From the <a href="http://www.reformer.com/ci_13019730?IADID=Search-www.reformer.com-www.reformer.com">Weekend Reformer</a> (Brattleboro, VT), August 8-9, 2009:
                            <blockquote>
                                BELLOWS FALLS -- A former LeFevre Ambulance Service employee is accusing the company of stealing the insurance payments from his paycheck to help make payroll, leading the insurance company to cancel his policy.
                                <p>
                                    Gregory Malone received a letter from MVP Health Care telling him that his policy was terminated just after his wife gave birth to the couple's first child.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now, with bills piling up for the mother and child due to complications brought on from the birth, Malone is talking to local, state and federal authorities to try to get the company to back pay the insurance money to get the coverage for his wife and child.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "I did everything I was supposed to do. I made the payments every week," Malone said as he pointed to the line on past payroll stubs showing that $151.52 was taken out. "But where did the money go?"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Malone said LeFevre Ambulance Director David Booth admitted that a former office employee had used the insurance payments to help meet the company's financial obligations, and according to Malone, the company promised to get the past due payments to MVP Healthcare.
                                </p>

                            <p>
                                The story continues, and only gets worse.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                ...
                                <p>
                                    "Our baby needs surgery and the bills are piling up," Malone said. "The surgery needs to happen and we don't have the money to pay for it."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    ...

                                <p>
                                    "We don't know what else to do. We don't want the money back, we just need the coverage," she [Malone's wife] said. "We're worried about our baby. We already owe $22,000 and we don't have $22,000. If they don't take care of this, we are really going to be in trouble."
                                </p>

                                The story was reported by Howard Weiss-Tisman, hwtisman [at] reformer [dot] com, (802) 254-2311 ext 279, if anyone needs more details. The AP hasn't picked this up. A Google News search shows only this one story in one tiny local newspaper.

                                <a href="http://rockbf.org/">Bellows Falls</a> is a town of 3,000 in south-eastern Vermont, on the New Hampshire border, not too far from Massachusetts. I recommend the <a href="http://www.missbellowsfallsdiner.com/">Miss Bellows Falls Diner</a>, if you happen to be in town for some reason (say, to interview a guy who needs health insurance).
