                            I was waiting for something like this before I shared. The other qualification: there may be bias in the predictions that they examined such that correct liberal questions were given more weight than correct conservative questions.
                        </p>

                            <p>
                                A <a href="http://www.hamilton.edu/documents/Analysis-of-Forcast-Accuracy-in-the-Political-Media.pdf">working paper</a> by students at Hamilton College out yesterday has the laudable aim of auditing the predictions made by political pundits in order to see whether they are any use or not. Unsurprisingly, it finds that Paul Krugman is the most useful columnist and that a bunch of hacks I’ve never heard of are the worst (it also, wonderfully, gives the success formula for prognostication as “avoid law school and adopt a liberal philosophy). Below the fold, a few points on a subject which many readers will know is dear to my heart.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <br>
                                First, this is an amazingly praiseworthy exercise. In one of the more successful posts on my personal blog, I noted that “the vital importance of audit” is one of the things they drill into you in business school. In general, people who don’t systematically keep track of how projections turned out, tend to get the quality of predictions they deserve. However, having said that, I would make two fairly significant qualifications to the methodology involved, from the perspective of someone who basically makes a living out of making predictions and assessing those of others.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                First, <b>not all bets are equal</b>. The performance metric used by the Hamilton team judges pundits on the basis of a pass-fail record of their predictions, equal weight given to each. But in the real world, people make predictions with a greater or lesser degree of certainty. You can be right materially less often than 50% of the time (“worse than a coin flip” or “ugly” by the paper’s classification) and still make a lot of money if you bet big when you are reasonably confident of being right, and bet small when you are less sure. This fact is what makes card-counting in blackjack work, for example – a card-counter still wins fewer than half the hands by number, but wins big bets and loses small ones. Similarly, it is axiomatic in backgammon that no amount of skill in moving the pieces will make up for poor play with the doubling cube. In principle, since the HC dataset contains a variable for the degree of certainty with which a prediction was expressed, the skill metric could be adjusted to take this into account – I suspect this would end up further polarising the scores but not necessarily changing their rank order.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Second, <b>staying wrong is worse than being wrong</b>. Predicting the future is hard, which is why so many people do it so badly. Predicting the recent past ought to be a lot easier, which is why it’s <a href="http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2011/05/prediction-and-retrodiction-from-well.html">somewhat more surprising</a> that it is also, in general, done quite badly. To use a nautical analogy, while it’s obviously great to be able to forecast the weather, it is often just as usual to have a nimble crew that can quickly trim your sails when the wind has changed. Philip Tetlock’s original study on prediction and pundits suggested that pundits often made mistakes by being too keen to predict change and underestimating the likelihood of the status quo, but this isn’t wholly a bad quality – hanging on to an outdated view of the world is often really very dangerous, and the risk/reward tradeoff is usually asymmetric[1]. I think it would be harder to measure this in quantitative ways, but it is highly worth bearing in mind.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, although the development of even rudimentary forms of audit is a great boon to the democratic public (and probably a lot more so than yet another inconclusive study of “media bias” one way or the other), I think it needs to be taken with two caveats. The biggest villain is not the guy who gets it wrong. The people who will cost you money and reputation over the long run are first, the guy who says he’s more certain than he really is, and second, the guy who won’t admit he’s wrong when he knows he is. Hang on to your wallet out there.
