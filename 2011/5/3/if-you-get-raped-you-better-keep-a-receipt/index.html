                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <img src="http://www.aclu.org/files/imagecache/cpi_header_image/cpi_images/pregnancy2.jpg" alt="">This week, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) returned from April recess with a spring in his step and a gleam in his eye. At the top of his agenda? A far-reaching attack on abortion access, misleadingly titled the "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act," as we like to say in the beltway, H.R. 3, which is scheduled for a vote tomorrow.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You might have thought that the anti-choice leaders in the House would be worn out from trying — and failing — <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/reproductive-freedom/agony-and-ecstasy-reproductive-rights-capitol-hill">to hold up the entire federal budget</a> over cervical cancer screenings (which, contrary to assertions made on <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em>, you can't get at <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/201104110009">Walgreens</a>). But these days they appear to have limitless energy for attacking women's health and well-being. This week's target is insurance coverage that includes abortion care.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The essence of H.R. 3 can be expressed in two words: <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/03/gop-bill-irs-abortion-audits">rape audits</a>. That's right, this bill could force rape and incest survivors who choose abortion care to prove their trauma to IRS agents. To be clear, this radical, expansive bill has <a href="http://www.aclu.org/reproductive-freedom/fact-sheet-hr-3-no-taxpayer-funding-abortion-act">many seriously harmful impacts</a>, but this one uniquely captures H.R. 3's malevolent spirit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In an effort to impose one narrow ideology on every woman's life, H.R. 3 rewrites long-standing tax laws to penalize a single, legal medical procedure: abortion. It denies tax credits to small businesses and middle-class families if their health plans include abortion coverage, and imposes a tax increase on women who need abortion care.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In their beneficence (also known as a response to <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/01/republican-plan-redefine-rape-abortion">really</a> <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/02/01/hr3_abortion_rape">bad</a> <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2011/0203/Did-bill-try-to-redefine-rape-GOP-backs-down-after-public-outcry.">press</a>), the bill's authors maintained a longstanding exception to the bill's restrictions for cases of rape and incest (as well as when a woman is in danger of dying), after initially trying to <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-february-2-2011/rape-victim-abortion-funding">narrow the definitions</a> of rape and incest. However, as we learned from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, the rape exception could be enforced just like every other tax provision — through IRS audits. And just as in every other audit, the burden would rest with the woman to produce sufficient evidence. Or as Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) <a href="http://wwww.c-spanvideo.org/program/298900-1">put it last month</a> at a <a href="http://www.aclu.org/reproductive-freedom/aclu-executive-director-anthony-d-romero-joins-activists-and-celebrities-rally-">rally</a> for women's health: if you get raped, you better keep a receipt.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What does this reveal? An utter callousness about the actual impact of government meddling in a woman's life, and a desire to make a difficult time even harder if that furthers the right's narrow social agenda. H.R. 3 represents radical government intrusion into a profoundly personal realm. Each of the provisions of the bill, whether not they have a quotable label, carries through that same theme.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to trying to excise abortion coverage from the private insurance market, H.R. 3 would make permanent the unjust abortion bans that prevent millions of women — such as those enrolled in Medicaid, federal employees, and residents of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/blog/reproductive-freedom/agony-and-ecstasy-reproductive-rights-capitol-hill">District of Columbia</a> — from having health insurance coverage that includes abortion care. In other words, H.R. 3 denies women health insurance that covers their health care needs. Talk about a total disregard for women and making a difficult time harder.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The authors of H.R. 3 have given us a gift: a bill where the heinous extent of government intrusion is impossible to ignore. <a href="https://secure.aclu.org/site/Advocacy?pagename=homepage&amp;id=3171&amp;page=UserAction&amp;s_subsrc=110503_HR3_BOR">Tell Congress enough is enough: a woman's medical decisions are her own.</a>
