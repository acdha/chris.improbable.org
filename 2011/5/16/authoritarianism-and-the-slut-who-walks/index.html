                                <blockquote>
                                    it shouldn't be surprising that conservative/orthodox/fundamentalist religious groups are selling patriarchy. That's actually only one little bit of their overlap. They're all selling one version or another of authoritarianism, which in a culturally conservative context is going to mean patriarchy. If you look, I'll bet you find that they're also all in favor of deference to religious and political authority, strong parental control over children, harsh punishment for crime, and the rest of the authoritarian package.
                                </blockquote>Turbulence agreed, and linked to <a href="http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/">Bob Altemeyer's invaluable book "The Authoritarians"</a> (free on the author's site). In Altemeyer's psychology studies, he found that
                                <blockquote>
                                    high RWAs [people who measure high on a scale of Right-Wing Authoritarianism] are “social conservatives” to a much greater extent than they are “economic conservatives.”
                                </blockquote>I agree that authoritarianism is crucial.
                                <p>
                                    Just as with fundamentalism, there is no strong logical or necessary tie between authoritarianism and strict gender roles. As Altemeyer defines them, Right Wing Authoritarians (RWAs)
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    have personalities featuring:<br>
                                    1) a high degree of submission to the established, legitimate authorities in their society;<br>
                                    2) high levels of aggression in the name of their authorities; and<br>
                                    3) a high level of conventionalism.
                                </blockquote>He points out that<br>
                                <blockquote>
                                    You could have left-wing authoritarian followers as well, who support a revolutionary leader who wants to overthrow the establishment. I knew a few in the 1970s, Marxist university students who constantly spouted their chosen authorities, Lenin or Trotsky or Chairman Mao.
                                </blockquote>Nowadays he rarely finds LWAs in the North American populations he studies, but there are RWAs a-plenty.
                                <p>
                                    There is nothing in Altemeyer's definition of the RWA personality that gives gender roles a central importance. This is a personality type, a set of characteristic emotional reactions -- it doesn't need logically to be tied to ideas about gender so very strongly, it could focus much more on legalism or race.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But I think gender is, in the human mind, closer to ideas about authority (religious or otherwise) than other topics, regardless of logic.

                                    Take something that has blown up in the world of progressive Christianity over the past few days. <a href="http://www.sojo.net/">Sojourners</a>, Jim Wallis' website/magazine that has been the most prominent flagbearer for "progressive evangelicals", refused to run this ad:
                                </p>

                                    The ad is from <a href="http://www.believeoutloud.com/">Believe Out Loud</a>, a cross-denominational group working to persuade mainline Protestant churches to be more accepting of <a href="http://thatgayblog.com/news/qltbg-quiltbag">QUILTBAG</a> people. It's a very cuddly, Kumbaya-and-cookies group, and the ad shows nothing more threatening than two nice young white women coming into church with their son and being reassured that they're welcome.

                                    But not, it seems, at Sojourners. Sarah Posner has a <a href="http://www.religiondispatches.org/dispatches/sarahposner/4592/progressive_christian%3A_wallis_%E2%80%9Cno_longer_speaks_for_us%E2%80%9D/">good roundup of the reaction</a>. <a href="http://www.patheos.com/community/slacktivist/2011/05/12/my-hope-is-built-on-nothing-less/">Fred Clark/slacktivist says</a>:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    [Wallis] has been a longtime, forceful and persuasive voice on behalf of economic and racial justice, peace and care for the environment.<br>
                                    ...<br>
                                    Yet the fact remains that Jim Wallis’ position on both abortion and homosexuality is such that he has remained in good standing as a mostly accepted member of the American evangelical community. His views on poverty, racial justice, peace and the environment may put him at odds with the gatekeepers of that community, who often characterize him as a dangerous radical, but in the final analysis they also regard him as One Of Us because, after all, he opposes abortion and the ordination of noncelibate homosexuals.
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Now, it’s tragic and probably heretical that this is how the American evangelical community decides who is and who is not an acceptable and recognized member of the community. Wallis’ long demonstration of a passionate faith doesn’t count in this calculus. Nor does his personal testimony, his church membership or his long track record as a Bible-soaked preacher of God’s Word. All that really matters is opposition to those two things: Abortion and homosexuality. All other ground is sinking sand, all other ground is sinking sand.Fred thinks that

                                <blockquote>
                                    the shibboleth of a "stance" opposing homosexuality tends to be, for evangelicals, as much about hermeneutics and the Bible as it is about sex and gender.
                                </blockquote>Fred goes on to <a href="http://www.patheos.com/community/slacktivist/2011/05/14/jim-wallis-and-believe-out-loud-part-2/">develop his theory that it's "really" about how evangelicals read the Bible</a>, but I will take the (for me) radical step of disagreeing with him.
                                <p>
                                    I don't think a "stance" against homosexuality, abortion, ordination of women, and other gender-role issues is a true shibboleth, a nearly-meaningless marker for identity. I think firm gender roles are the *point*, and Christianity itself is coming along for the ride.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If Fred is right, there would be no reason to expect an anti-gay "stance" to be important for conservatives of other religions, who have different sacred books (or none at all), and have very different ways of reading them. Nor would the "stance" be the same for fundamentalists and Roman Catholics, who have diametrically opposed ways of reading the Bible.

                                    What I think is going on is well-illustrated by many posts at <a href="http://www.baylyblog.com/">Out of Our Minds</a>, a blog by the Bayly brothers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian_Church_in_America">PCA</a> pastors. The Baylys argue that the ordination of women and tolerance for homosexuality are linked, and both <a href="http://www.baylyblog.com/2008/08/wiisdid.html">undercut the doctrine of the Trinity</a>:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    The revealed specific relations between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost show us that those relations are simultaneously ones of <b>equality</b> and <b>hierarchy</b>.<br>
                                    ...<br>
                                    The egalitarianism to which both apologists for women’s ordination and sodomy subscribe asserts functional interchangeability and denies a hierarchy of divinely ordered relations.
                                </blockquote>I'm not saying that the Baylys' arguments make perfect logical or theological sense -- but they do cut to the chase psychologically. This is the emotional reality: people who feel a strong need for hierarchies and authority structures insist on strict gender roles. Indeed, I think it may be the other way around: people's inner model for hierarchical authority begins at home, in what <a href="http://www.wwcd.org/issues/Lakoff.html">George Lakoff</a> calls the "Strict Father Model" and I call The Patriarchy.

                                    Here is <a href="http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/">an example</a> I talked about in comments to my previous post, to explain what I mean by Patriarchy in action:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    On January 24th, 2011, a representative of the Toronto Police gave shocking insight into the Force’s view of sexual assault by stating: "women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized".
                                </blockquote>Oddly enough, there is no evidence that a woman's clothing has any effect on whether she's likely to be raped -- not least because most rapes are by someone the victim already knows. Yet we've all heard innumerable times that women who dress "that way" are "asking for it" -- in other words, that wearing clothing that may be fashionable or attractive or cool or what's clean is considered reasonable grounds for assault, by reasonable and powerful people. That's the kind of thing I mean by "The Patriarchy" -- not a conspiracy, a set of pervasive cultural assumptions.
                                <p>
                                    This time, though, many of the women of Toronto found they had reached their snapping point. They organized a Slut Walk, and before you know it there was <a href="http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/satellite">a movement</a>, spread across North America. Our old friend <a href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/38362">Lindsay Beyerstein</a> sums it up this way:
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    Organizers told people to wear whatever they wanted. The message was: Who's a slut? We all are. Or none of us are. And who cares? It's a stupid, meaningless concept anyway.
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    "Slut" is just another way of saying "worthless" without having to come up with a reason.<br>
                                    ...<br>
                                    If you try to argue that you're not a slut, you're implicitly buying into the idea that there are sluts out there. If there's some criterion that will set you free, that standard will indict someone else--someone with a higher "number," or shorter skirt, or a later curfew. So we get bogged down in slut/non-slut border skirmishes over a line nobody should have tried to draw in the first place, and we all lose.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The only "refutation" is to laugh in your accuser's face and get on with your life, however you choose to live it. That's what Slut Walk is about.

                                    Just do your damned jobs, cops, and protect everyone.Several people pointed out that I make gay rights and women's rights seem more closely linked than they've been in practice. This is true: I think the logical and psychological connections between gay rights and women's rights are very close, but the politics has played out differently. Rights for QUILTBAGs have been much slower in coming than rights for women, mostly IMHO because everyone knows they know women. I support gay rights in part because I think QUILTBAGs are often used as whipping boys for women -- that a lot of anxiety about women undercutting natural or God-given hierarchies is being attributed to QUILTBAGs, a much safer group to stigmatize.
