                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <strong>By Thoreau</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://pluto.huji.ac.il/~azussman/partisan_grading.pdf">A study of how liberal and conservative professors grade <em>(.pdf)</em></a> has gotten some <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/05/20/study_finds_differences_in_republican_and_democratic_grading_patterns">attention</a>. The soundbite version is that two economists studied grading patterns of professors at a large, elite university for several years, and found that Democrats tend to give fewer grades at the high and low ends of the scale, while Republicans give a wider distribution of grades. Also, black students apparently get slightly lower grades in classes taught by Republican professors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not having read the study in detail, I have no real comment to offer on whether the potentially explosive conclusions are supported by the data, whether the methods are sound, or whether this validates my existing world-view. Instead, I’d rather focus on something else: After reading the soundbite version, many intertubez commenters followed internet tradition and responded with “This social science study can’t possibly be valid, because the authors didn’t control for this variable that would explain everything.” In this case, the variable in question is discipline: There are more Republicans in business schools and economics departments than in teh librul artz, so <strong>obviously</strong> we’re just seeing disciplinary differences in grading, right? That’s the REAL variable that those smarty-pants social scientists didn’t even bother to account for, and I know this because I read the soundbite version.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well, in violation of internet tradition I decided to actually Read The Fucking Article. I didn’t read it in detail, but I was able to ascertain two things:<br>
                                1) The study was limited to the College of Arts and Sciences at an elite university. (This is stated on page 4 of the .pdf linked above.) Right-wing professors in the Business School and soft-grading left-wing professors in the College of Education weren’t included. Yes, there might still be significant variation by discipline within the College of Arts and Sciences, but some of the easy strawman arguments are not applicable here.<br>
                                2) Although I haven’t examined it in detail, the authors did not ignore differences between disciplines. These points are made on the bottom of page 6 and top of page 7, with reference to tables. I haven’t examined it closely enough to say whether they did enough work or had a large enough sample to really disentangle disciplinary effects from other variables, but I can say that (contrary to those who read only the soundbite version) the issue was not ignored. If you wish to find fault with their claims, you’ll have to actually read and analyze what they said (a librul artz skill) rather than just assert that some variable was ignored and therefore the whole thing is invalid.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Again, I’m not endorsing anything in that study, because I haven’t read it in detail, but some of the obvious stuff is actually addressed (however thoroughly or sloppily) despite the dismissals by intertubez commenters.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Also, I have my own theory which must be right because those smarty-pants social scientists didn’t address it: There is literature showing that students respond differently to feedback depending on whether the professor grades with a red pen or a green pen. Did they consider the possibility that partisan preference dictates ink preference? I recently switched to green pens, just for the hell of it, but I plan to switch to colloidal silver pens when I run out of green ink. (I would just throw my green pens in the trash, but that would not be fiscally prudent.)
