                            <p>
                                MY GUT is glad Osama bin Laden took a slug to the brainpan, but I see last night's rough justice more as cause for relieved trepidation than celebration. To me, Mr bin Laden's long overdue demise simply punctuates America's embarrassingly foolhardy, self-undermining and inept response to the 9/11 attacks. After failing to find an elderly man on dialysis for almost a decade, yesterday's hit feels more than a bit belated. It's as if Team America missed the woulda-been game-winning three-pointer but stayed on the court long after the buzzer tenaciously chucking clunkers for hours until finally they nailed it in a dim, empty, echoing arena. We don't cut down the nets for that. But maybe now we can let ourselves go home. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/opinion/02douthat.html">a perceptive column</a> Ross Douthat offers a hopeful but grounded post-game pep talk: 
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    This is a triumph for the United States of America, for our soldiers and intelligence operatives, and for the president as well. But it is not quite the triumph that it would have seemed if bin Laden had been captured a decade ago, because those 10 years have taught us that we didn’t need to fear him and his rabble as much as we did, temporarily but intensely, in the weeks when ground zero still smoked.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They’ve taught us, instead, that whatever blunders we make (and we have made many), however many advantages we squander (and there has been much squandering), and whatever quagmires we find ourselves lured into, our civilization is not fundamentally threatened by the utopian fantasy politics embodied by groups like Al Qaeda, or the mix of thugs, fools and pseudointellectuals who rally around their banner.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They can strike us, they can wound us, they can kill us. They can goad us into tactical errors and strategic blunders. But they are not, and never will be, an existential threat. 
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                This a thoughtfully tender way of conceding that, yes, Mr bin Laden succeeded in striking fear into a superpower, leading it to squander its advantages, to make tactical errors and strategic blunders by the dozen, and luring it into bloody, treasury-draining, still-ongoing quagmires. If these last ten years have taught us anything, it is that a terrorist threat need not be "existential" to succeed in warping the moral terms of our national existence.     
                            </p>

                                Radley Balko <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/2011/05/02/he-won/">is more forthright</a>. "He won", Mr Balko boldy begins.

                                    In <em>The Looming Tower</em>, the Pulitzer-winning history of al-Qaeda and the road to 9/11, author Lawrence Wright lays out how Osama bin Laden’s motivation for the attacks that he planned in the 1990s, and then the September 11 attacks, was to draw the U.S. and the West into a prolonged war—an actual war in Afghanistan, and a broader global war with Islam.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Osama got both. And we gave him a prolonged war in Iraq to boot. By the end of Obama’s first term, we’ll probably top 6,000 dead U.S. troops in those two wars, along with hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and Afghans. The cost for both wars is also now well over $1 trillion.
                                </p>

                                Tragically, that's not all. Not even close. Mr Balko observes that America's reaction to Mr bin Laden's monstrous <em>piece de resistance</em> on September 11th, 2001 "fundamentally altered who we are" in ways that should make us pause at least a moment before raising our tiny America flags:

                                    <li>We’ve sent terrorist suspects to “black sites” to be detained without trial and tortured.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>We’ve turned terrorist suspects over to other regimes, knowing that they’d be tortured.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>In those cases when our government later learned it got the wrong guy, federal officials not only refused to apologize or compensate him, they went to court to argue he should be barred from using our courts to seek justice, and that the details of his abduction, torture, and detainment should be kept secret.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>We’ve abducted and imprisoned dozens, perhaps hundreds of men in Guantanamo who turned out to have been innocent. Again, the government felt no obligation to do right by them.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The government launched a multimillion dollar ad campaign implying that people who smoke marijuana are implicit in the murder of nearly 3,000 of their fellow citizens.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The government illegally spied and eavesdropped on thousands of American citizens.

                                    <li>Presidents from both of the two major political parties have claimed the power to detain suspected terrorists and hold them indefinitely without trial, based solely on the president’s designation of them as an “enemy combatant,” essentially making the president prosecutor, judge, and jury. (I’d also argue that the treatment of someone like Bradley Manning wouldn’t have been tolerated before September 11.)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The current president has also claimed the power to execute U.S. citizens, off the battlefield, without a trial, and to prevent anyone from knowing about it after the fact.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The Congress approved, the president signed, and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a broadly written law making it a crime to advocate for any organization the government deems sympathetic to terrorism. This includes challenging the “terrorist” designation in the first place.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Flying in America now means enduring a humiliating and hassling ritual that does little if anything to actually make flying any safer. Every time the government fails to catch an attempt at terrorism, it punishes the public for its failure by adding to the ritual.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>American Muslims, a heartening story of success and assimilation, are now harassed and denigrated for merely trying to build houses of worship.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Without a warrant, the government can search and seize indefinitely the laptops and other personal electronic devices of anyone entering the country.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The Department of Homeland Security now gives terrorism-fighting grants for local police departments across the country to purchase military equipment, such as armored personnel carriers, which is then used against U.S. citizens, mostly to serve drug warrants.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                If all this doesn't make Osama bin Laden history's most successful terrorist, I can't imagine what would. If only his sickening legacy had died with him. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In any case, America needs to move on. If Americans need to feel like winners to move on, then I desperately hope Mr bin Laden's death will be <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2011/05/osama-bin-ladens-death-could-be-a-great-time-to-declare-victory-in-the-war-on-terror/">used to declare victory</a> in the war on terror. In that case, let the flags fly. Let closure come. Yet, <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/05/02/bin_laden">like Glenn Greenwald</a>, I cannot help but fear that last night's bang-up job in Abbottabad will instead invigorate America's flagging belief in the efficacy of its unsurpassed capacity for violence, tempting us to compound our errors. Mr Greenwald writes:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>

                                    Whenever America uses violence in a way that makes its citizens cheer, beam with nationalistic pride, and rally around their leader, more violence is typically guaranteed. Futile decade-long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan may temporarily dampen the nationalistic enthusiasm for war, but two shots to the head of Osama bin Laden—and the We are Great and Good proclamations it engenders—can easily rejuvenate that war love. One can already detect the stench of that in how Pakistan is being talked about: did they harbor bin Laden as it seems and, if so, what price should they pay? We're feeling good and strong about ourselves again—and righteous—and that's often the fertile ground for more, not less, aggression.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                That America failed for so long to find and kill the devil who led us so successfully into temptation, who delivered us so fully to evil, has left an exceedingly proud people with a suppurating psychic wound. Shooting Mr bin Laden and dumping him in the sea may or may not make Americans safer. Maybe it marks the welcome end of an ugly era. Maybe it marks the start of a fresh cycle of vengeance and destruction. Who knows? Either way, Mr bin Laden's demise makes most Americans feel better. It seems to balance the moral scales, which is inherently cathartic. But it also helps us feel strong again. And, perhaps most importantly, it helps us convince ourselves that, in the end, we won the war against al Qaeda. That's something we seem to need to believe, whether or not it's really true. Here's hoping believing it helps. Here's hoping we finally call it a day.
