                        A relative asked for some tips for a friend who was visiting DC and staying near Thomas Circle. This ran a bit long…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sounds like fun. Just off the top of my head, you’re right around the corner from one of DC’s best beer bars (<a href="http://www.churchkeydc.com/">Churchkey</a>); I haven’t been to the restaurant downstairs (Birch &amp; Barley) but it’s also supposed to be good. <a href="http://www.beckdc.com/">Brasserie Beck</a> is a very popular Belgian place with excellent mussels and a good beer selection. <a href="http://peregrineespresso.com/">Peregrine</a> might have their second coffeeshop open on 14th St. by then; otherwise your best option for high-quality coffee is probably <a href="http://www.chinatowncoffee.com/">Chinatown Coffee</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Ethiopian food, <a href="http://www.dukemrestaurant.com/">Dukem</a> is quite nice - there’s a big vegetarian platter which is quite good for variety - and <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/lalibela-restaurant-washington">Lalibela</a> is good and also quite close to where you’re staying. In general, you can’t go too far wrong if you walk up to U St. (not too far) and stop when you smell something tasty. One word of caution: we haven’t been to a quick Ethiopian place yet, so plan for a comfortable, leisurely dinner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Heading down to Chinatown, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/burma-restaurant-washington">Burma</a> is good for variety and <a href="http://www.jaleo.com/">Jaleo</a> has good Spanish food. <a href="http://www.rasikarestaurant.com/">Rasika</a> is a good high-end Indian restaurant - perhaps if you were thinking “upscale night out” - but to be honest, the best Indian food in the area requires a car trip up to College Park. <a href="http://www.zaytinya.com/">Zaytinya</a> is great option for Greek/Turkish/Lebanese and has good happy-hour pricing and specials.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Around the Mall, there aren’t many options on the south side - the cafe at the American Indian museum is easily my favorite as they feature a wide selection of Native-American food. One option which has really improved matters during the week is the new wave of food trucks competing with the traditional hot-dog vendors; the locations vary and the easiest way to track the options is to use a Twitter aggregator like <a href="http://foodtruckfiesta.com/dc-food-trucks/">Food Truck Fiesta</a> - they frequently tend to cover the areas around the Mall since there are a ton of visitors and federal workers looking for better lunch options.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you found yourself on Capitol Hill, <a href="http://www.montmartredc.com/seventhhill/">Seventh Hill Pizza</a> is superb and <a href="http://www.belgacafe.com/">Belga</a> is another good Belgian option.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our favorite chocolate covered figs come from <a href="http://www.biagiochocolate.com/">Biagio</a> which is heading into the Adams-Morgan (18th St. NW up past U St). If you were up there, perhaps walking on the way to the Zoo, a really fast, tasty and cheap option is the <a href="http://www.falafelshop.com/">Amsterdam Falafelshop</a> and if you were looking for light meals and good coffee or drinks, <a href="http://www.trystdc.com/">Tryst</a> is a coffeeshop with a liquor license and a full kitchen. There’s also a hispanic street market there during the day with most Central &amp; South American cuisines represented by at least one stand. (One note: there are many places which claim to serve Mexican food in DC; none of the ones I’ve tried have been good. The closest option to moving back to San Diego which I’ve found is a taco cart in Northern Virginia).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’m not sure how you were planning to get around town but one new option is <a href="http://capitalbikeshare.com/">Capital Bikeshare</a> You can spend $5 for unlimited 30-minute rides within a 24-hour period or $15 for 5 days, there’s a great iPhone/Android app to find the closest station, and it’s extremely convenient for dodging traffic while still seeing the city. I use this heavily to head down to work and have been quite happy with it.
