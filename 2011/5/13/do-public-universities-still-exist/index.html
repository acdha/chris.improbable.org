                            It's been more than a bit maddening to watch the boomers underfund the system which so richly benefited them but I shudder to imagine the fate of any prominent politician who dared to directly acknowledge that.

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://blogs-images.forbes.com/erikkain/files/2011/05/sanjose.jpg"><img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;margin:0px 0px 0px 10px;border-top:0px;border-right:0px" border="0" alt="sanjose" align="right" src="http://blogs-images.forbes.com/erikkain/files/2011/05/sanjose_thumb.jpg" width="369" height="331"></a> Aside from national defense, there are a handful of things government spends money on that are essentially necessities. Public healthcare, infrastructure, and a system of justice are three of the big ones. Education is another. Education is like infrastructure, in a sense, in that it serves basically as an investment. Public roads are an investment in commerce as much as anything. Public education is an investment in human and social capital.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I say this as someone who hates to break up everything into issues of profit and capital. I don’t want education to merely function as the training grounds for our next generation of worker bees. On the other hand, I believe that a creative education <em>not</em> geared toward training worker bees will be a <em>better</em> investment in the future workforce. So I hardly think avoiding a consumerist mindset is exclusive to thinking about creating a vibrant future economy led by well-educated Americans.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is why, for all my libertarian tendencies, I support <u>strong public options</u>. Public roads, public healthcare, public safety and public education. Education is perhaps the most important. The better educated someone is, the less likely they are to use <em>other</em> public options like healthcare or prison beds. So an investment now in education pays off many times over down the road.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In any case, I <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/erikkain/2011/04/15/a-college-education-should-not-result-in-crushing-debt/">wrote recently about the so-called education bubble</a>, and one of the conclusions I came to is that we need to, as a society, refocus our priorities and actually <em>pay</em> for education. Letting tuition continue its endless climb is going to either crowd out kids from lower income brackets, or force more and more young people to take on unaffordable debt. This is not the right way to invest in the future of our society. We all want low taxes, but if we’re going to spend our tax dollars on anything, education is the place to spend it.

                                    At a certain point, public universities will have ceased to exist. We will only have a variety of private universities, some of which will be subsidized a little bit by tax-payers. Depending on where you draw the line, the University of California might already be at that point — student tuition now makes up a larger portion of the UC’s budget than state funding — but the long-term trend is undeniable: since 2004, the amount of money the UC has gotten from the state of California has been cut in half, and has continued to decline, every year, with utter and complete reliability. And where the UC and CSU systems are now, every other public university will soon follow. This is not a trend that’s going to end tomorrow. This is a trend that ends with the end of public universities. It just depends on where you decide to draw the line.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With a handful of exceptions, people outside of academia seem to be strikingly oblivious to this simple fact, even people who should be allies. Take erstwhile progressive Californian blogger Kevin Drum. It’s not that his <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/05/harvard-worth-it">post today</a>,  “Is Harvard Worth it?” is wrong, exactly. The problem is that Drum displays a the same obliviousness to the elephant in the room that so many progressives seem to have. After noting that “I ended up graduating from Cal State Long Beach, and I did pretty well during my pre-blogging career,” he tosses out the line “If you can only afford to go to a state university, don’t fret about it too much.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “If you can only afford to go to a state university, don‘t fret about it too much.” Except this: Kevin Drum went to a state university that does not exist anymore. When he graduated from Cal State Long Beach in 1981, he <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/pa/info/fees-historical-perspective.shtml">paid</a> $<strong>160</strong> in fees. If he graduated from the same institution today, the <em>tuition</em> he would have paid for this year <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/pa/info/fees-historical-perspective.shtml">would be</a> $<strong>4,335</strong>. They officially call it “tuition” now, because it’s not meant to be a nominal “fee” anymore. It’s simply the price you pay for your education, as a customer, and next year it will be higher, a lot higher. Unless the <a href="http://www.daily49er.com/news/csulb-tuition-may-rise-by-up-to-32-1.2561920">direction of things</a> change soon, it will be $<strong>6,450</strong>. And the year after that? It will be even higher. Fees/Tuition in the Cal State system have risen significantly every year since when Kevin Drum went there, and they have risen by around <a href="http://castateofemergency.com/wp-content/uploads/CSU-Student-Fee-History-2002-thru-2011-12.pdf">400%</a> since 2002. Given the complete intransigence of California republicans, tuition will most likely rise by another <a href="http://www.daily49er.com/news/csulb-tuition-may-rise-by-up-to-32-1.2561920">32%</a> next year.

                                Even adjusting for inflation, this is a huge increase. Like healthcare costs, education has continued to skyrocket over the past few decades. There are many reasons for this beyond a failure of the public to commit to the necessary taxes, and <a href="http://lhote.blogspot.com/2011/04/reducing-college-costs.html">Freddie deBoer has done a good job suggesting ways to rein in spending</a>. He lists five areas to focus on:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    <b>1. Rein in administration spending.</b>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>2. Reduce the number of services provided by most colleges.</b>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>3. Stop (or never return to) the madcap physical expansion.</b>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>4. Penalize taking longer than four years; incentivize taking less.</b>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>5. Recognize that not everyone is equipped to graduate from college.</strong>
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                There are, of course, others, but Freddie’s are all sound ideas (you should <a href="http://lhote.blogspot.com/2011/04/reducing-college-costs.html">read the whole post</a> for detailed explanations of each.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mike Konczal has <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2011/05/05/the-college-bubble-and-the-public-defunding-of-colleges/">made a convincing case</a> that aside from all these very real spending issues, what we’re facing is a problem with our commitment to education as a <em>public</em> good:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    The University of California has increased tuition by 32 percent since the middle of the 2009-10 school year, Florida has a total two-year increase of 32 percent, undergraduate tuition at Georgia’s four public research universities will increase 16 percent, etc. California is important, as their regent’s battle to de facto privatization of their school system will set the course for many other states.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A leverage induced bubble is particularly painful for the economy. <strong>The debt that is fueling the current costs of college are the result of a long-term set of decisions to shift the costs away from taxpayers and towards debt burdens for individual students.</strong>  If you <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2011/04/20/on-public-funding-of-colleges-and-towards-a-general-theory-of-public-options/">think that direct funding of <b>public</b> colleges, like all <b>public</b> <b>options</b> in markets</a> where there is high consumer inelasticity, serve as a check on runaway price inflation and subsidization of private incumbents, this further retrenchment bodes poorly for the prospect of higher education. [emphasis added, EDK]
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                This is what we’re really looking at – a shifting of costs away from taxpayers (many of whom benefited from a taxpayer-based education themselves) toward debt burdens for individual students. This isn’t such a problem when those students come from wealthy or upper-middle-class families, but it is a problem if we want to open public education up to the <em>entire</em> public – or at least the members of the public who are going to do well in an academic setting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Creating a viable public option in education for the many students who are better served by vocational training is also important, and the emergence of a for-profit college industry to meet this demand is troubling.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I think there is a real risk that public education will no longer be available to a large portion of the American people. This is terribly short-sighted from an economic perspective. We’ll spend the money on healthcare costs and prisons if we don’t spend it on education.
                            </p>
