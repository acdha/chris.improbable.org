                            <p>
                                <em>Updated 10:43 a.m., May 19, with statement from Siemens.</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Multiple security vulnerabilities in Siemens industrial-control systems could allow hackers with remote access to cause physical destruction to factories and power plants, says the<br>
                                security researcher who discovered the holes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dillon Beresford canceled a planned demonstration of the vulnerabilities at the TakeDownCon security conference in Texas on Wednesday, after Siemens and the Department of Homeland Security expressed concern — both over the phone and at the conference — about disclosing information before Siemens could patch the vulnerabilities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beresford, a researcher who works for <a href="http://www.nsslabs.com/">NSS Labs</a> in Austin, Texas, says he decided to cancel the talk — “<a href="http://www.takedowncon.com/?page_id=1148">Chain Reactions — Hacking SCADA</a>” — after realizing the full ramifications of the information he planned to reveal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Based on my own understanding of the seriousness behind this, I decided to refrain from disclosing any information due to safety concerns for the consumers that are affected by the vulnerabilities,” Beresford told Threat Level. He added, “DHS in no way tried to censor the presentation.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The vulnerabilities affect the programmable logic controllers, or PLCs, in several Siemens SCADA, or supervisory control and data acquisition, systems. Siemens PLC products are used in companies throughout the United States and the world controlling everything from critical infrastructure systems such as nuclear power and enrichment plants to commercial manufacturing facilities.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was a vulnerability in a PLC belonging to Siemens’ Step7 control system that was the target of the <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/11/stuxnet-clues/">sophisticated Stuxnet worm</a>. Stuxnet was discovered on systems in Iran last year and is believed to have been designed by a nation state aimed at destroying uranium-enrichment centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beresford began researching SCADA systems independently at home about two-and-a-half months ago. He purchased SCADA products online with funding from his employer and planned to examine systems belonging to multiple vendors. Beresford began with Siemens and found multiple vulnerabilities in the products very quickly.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “They’re very easy to exploit,” Beresford said. “As long as you have access to [a PLC's] network you will be able to exploit.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beresford wouldn’t say how many vulnerabilities he found in the Siemens products, but said he gave the company four exploit modules to test. He believes that at least one of the vulnerabilities he found affects multiple SCADA-system vendors, which share “commonality” in their products. Beresford wouldn’t reveal more details, but says he hopes to do so at a later date.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Siemens is fully aware of the vulnerabilities in its Programmable Logic Controllers discovered by researcher Dillon Beresford of NSS Labs, and we appreciate the responsible disclosure provided by NSS Labs,” wrote Siemens spokesman Bob Bartels in an e-mail. “We are in the process of testing patches and developing mitigation strategies.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beresford contacted the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team, or ICS-CERT, to disclose the vulnerabilities. ICS-CERT is a computer-security group the Department of Homeland Security operates in partnership with Idaho National Laboratory. The group researches vulnerabilities in industrial-control systems and helps alert vendors and customers about security holes in products.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beresford gave ICS-CERT exploits for the vulnerabilities, which the lab was able to confirm worked.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “They just said it was far-reaching and more serious than anything they’ve ever dealt with,” Beresford said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A DHS official, who asked not to be identified, said only that ICS-CERT frequently engages with vendors and members of the cybersecurity community to share vulnerability information and mitigation measures, and that “responsible disclosure process does not encourage the release of sensitive vulnerability information without also validating and releasing a solution.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                ICS-CERT contacted Siemens, based in Germany, and the company began to work on patches for the vulnerabilities. Both Siemens and ICS-CERT had been fine with Beresford’s initial decision to talk about the vulnerabilities at the conference, but changed their mind once they saw his presentation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Siemens was still working on patches but had found a remediation for one of the vulnerabilities. But Beresford found he was easily able to get around it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “It’s a recommendation which is in their defense in-depth model,” Beresford said. “There’s a button in their product that says ‘protect me more.’ … It’s the only security feature they have in their product to protect it and it’s flawed.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once Siemens saw in his presentation that their mitigation didn’t work, the company realized it had to go back to the lab and reassess how to address the vulnerability, Beresford said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The decision to pull the talk at the last minute caused rumors to fly at the conference. Another presenter at TakeDownCon tweeted that DHS had banned Beresford’s talk.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But Beresford disputed this and said he’s been “extremely impressed” with the way ICS-CERT has handled the matter.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “This is different from simply stealing money out of someone’s bank account,” said NSS Labs CEO Rick Moy. “Things could explode. I don’t want to overplay this and sound like it’s a bunch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD</a> but physical damage can occur, and people can be seriously injured or worse. So we felt … it was best to be prudent and wait a little bit longer until we get more information.”
