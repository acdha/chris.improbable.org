                                What a week. Holy crap. Remember where we all were last Friday? <a href="http://emilylhauserinmyhead.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/white-americans-really-need-to-shut-up-and-listen/">Furious and/or grief-stricken</a> over a ridiculous teevee charlatan having the social and cultural pull to force our first African-American president — the most powerful black man in history — to show his papers.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/05/02/osama-bin-laden-dead">And then, of course, this happened, too</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                (The latter event, by the way, <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/gadgets/obamas-bin-laden-speech-triggers-4000-tweets-per-second-2011052/">apparently generated 4000 tweets per <em>second</em> at the beginning and end of the speech</a>, <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/42897772/ns/today-entertainment/t/million-watch-obamas-bin-laden-speech/">and was watched by 56 million American viewers</a> [which, given that a whole lot of people didn't even know what was going on, is an even bigger number than it seems]).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And now look where we are!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I know there’s a lot of arguing around the details of Osama bin Ladin’s death, and about the morality of celebrating the shedding of anyone’s blood (I for one am sticking with: “I’m not happy, but I feel a grim satisfaction”), not to mention what this all means going forward, but as Clarence Darrow noted: <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/c/clarenceda124719.html">“To think is to differ.”</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’m not worried about the arguments (other than those folks who want to peddle the pile of poo that OBL is, in fact, still alive — that’s gotta stop), because Americans live in a free and open society and to the extent that we’re genuinely thinking about these events, we’re also likely to disagree on them. I think that in the main, we agree that it’s a good thing that a man who <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/05/pete-hamill-on-9-11-jihads-and-why-bin-ladens-death-cant-bring-closure/238406/">“used money he’d never earned to kill people and called it a holy mission”</a> is no longer walking the earth, and in the main, we’re feeling that the man in the Oval Office has every right to be there. That furthermore, he’s doing a good job, particularly where others have failed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And those facts right there: Osama is dead, and Obama is trusted (not to mention widely seen as having triumphed majestically over those who would deem him not worthy of the Presidency) — those are good facts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But as I say: It hasn’t exactly been happiness coursing through my veins this week.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There’s been pride in our President, first on Saturday night, as he showed the delegitimatizers the door, and then on Sunday night, as he told us of the months-long operation against the man responsible for the deaths of so many thousands. Pride in him this week as I have watched him eschew triumphalism, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-05-06-obama-ground-zero_n.htm">pride at the quiet respect he has shown those who lost their loved ones on that terrible September day</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I also found myself returned to that day, returned to that mourning. I’m not sure what it means to say that bin Laden’s death brings “closure to America” — if that’s true for you, that’s a good thing, but I don’t really understand what it means to say that for an entire nation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I know that for me, it actually opened the wound back up, as I imagine it might have for survivors, as well. A week to touch the memories again, the tears. I walked out of my house today, on one of the first truly beautiful spring days we’ve had this year, and thought “this is what it was like that day, on 9/11 — no, it’s not. It was warmer that day. But the sky was just this blue,” and then I looked straight up into the blue, and saw an airplane and thought, as I have thought every single time that I have looked up and seen an airplane since that horrible day: “It’s not exploding.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And there’s this — also a cause for renewed sorrow: We are not the people we were a decade ago. Not because we were forced to change by hateful men with a despicable ideology, but because we made choices that changed us.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The ripping and tearing at our Constitution, the torture that we’ve inflicted, on innocent and guilty alike, and the wars we’ve unleashed, at least one with absolutely no provocation or justification, which have led to many countless more dead than those killed ten years ago — these things are unsupportable, immoral, a blight on our collective conscience, and a self-inflicted disgrace. If I could have my way, if the universe worked this way, I would exchange bin Laden’s life for a decade without torture in a heartbeat. In a heartbeat.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Bottom line, if we really want to defeat al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and all the affiliates and friends of either, it’s not enough to have killed one man, no matter how powerful. If we really want to defeat bin Laden, we have to scratch back those freedoms that he did, in fact, hate. We have scratch back the moral courage to stop torturing people, and start prosecuting those who did (please Mr. Obama, Mr. Holder — we must). We have to scratch back — or, more likely, create — some kind of shared ability to recognize the evil we have caused in our wars, and to work to genuinely begin to set things right. As right as they can be.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In many ways, this was a very good week. But good doesn’t always mean happy.
