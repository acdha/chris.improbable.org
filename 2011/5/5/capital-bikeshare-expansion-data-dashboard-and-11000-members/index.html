                                    At the Bicycle Advisory Committee meeting last night, Chris Holben with DDOT reported on the many changes coming to Capital Bikeshare.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The biggest thing is the 25 station expansion. This is in addition to the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/EricFidler/status/64331125492957186">handful of stations</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/bikeshare/status/64034629744738304">that</a> still need to be rolled out from the initial 100. 5 stations will be built in the ballpark district using performance parking revenue from that area - basically the area bounded by the Potomac, the Anacostia, the SE/SW Freeway and 8th Street SE. Yards Park and the new DDOT office are couple favorites to get stations. The other 20 are being paid for with CMAQ money and can go anywhere. DDOT is hosting a <a href="http://ddot.dc.gov/DC/DDOT/About+DDOT/News+Room/Public+Meetings/DDOT+to+Host+Public+Meeting+for+Capital+Bikeshare+Expansion+in+the+District">public meeting</a> on the expansion and where to put stations on May 25th. Until then, you can submit comments online (to &nbsp;<a href="mailto:DDOT.Bikeshare@dc.gov?subject=Capital%20Bikesharing%20Expansion%202011">ddot.bikeshare@dc.gov</a>)&nbsp;- 450 people already have. And, it's pretty clear some formal campaigns are underway as there are a few places that have gotten many comments. Lesson, if you want one on your block, get that listserv going.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition to more stations, they'll be rightsizing some stations. Some stations might become smaller, but mostly stations <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/bikeshare/status/64003505974804481">will get larger</a>. They'll be making decisions based on two factors: how much is the station used and how much revenue does it bring in. Some stations are used very much, but the people who use it are buying a lot of one day memberships, and those are good for the body line, so those stations might be expanded. Holben said they are looking to be self-sustaining, which would be good politically (and for the long-term viability of the system). They're open to the idea that they may have to move some stations, but they won't be doing that any time soon as they want to give every station a chance for at least a year.
                                </p>

                                    Another big piece of news is that this month they hope to kick off a dashboard that will have "all the data you could want". Point to point trips, usage per various time periods, etc... Should be an exciting day at GGW and Housing Complex. Also <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Spotcycle/status/63681170705100800">Spotcycle now has a bikepath layer</a>.
                                </p>

                                    The original contract said they wanted to put 30% of the bikes in storage in the winter. But they also started with 2 bikes for every 3 docks. After some evaluation they're moving to 1 bike for every 2 docks, which they think will increase efficiency, as such they will keep the same number of bikes out all year long.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    7000+ people signed up for the living social deal and 5000 of them have redeemed their membership. As of this week, they have 11772 members and have had 21,000 day users. So they blew right past the 10,000 members by the end of the year goal. And last Saturday they recorded their highest ridership day ever - <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/bikeshare/status/65051416884027392">5323</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They also have plans to increase helmet usage. Soon they're going to give coupons to new members for a free helmet and they're also looking at selling a CaBi branded yellow and red bike helmet, which they hope people will wear as a token of pride (they should only sell them to members to create cache). They're also reaching out to hotel concierge's to give CaBi information to guests and possibly make helmets available to them.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since DDOT works closely with Bike and roll on the Bike Station, they don't want CaBi to take business away from them. Reports are that it is actually helping Bike and Roll since CaBi refers people looking for a day long bike to them. Bike and Roll also has a postcard that lists what they offer and what CaBi doesn't, as a way to differentiate the services.
                                </p>

                                    Finally, they've had few problems thus far. They've had 370,000 trips and only 8 crashes. There has been some minor vandalism in the form of graffiti and slashed tires. When it first opened they had problems with bikes that were improperly checked in and then stolen, but they recovered all of those bikes but 2.&nbsp;
