                            One can dream…
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Are Microsoft, Apple and Google quietly preparing for war with mobile carriers? I think so.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With all the advancements in mobile phones in the past 10 years, the part that’s been woefully slow to advance is the phone part. Making calls, placing calls, searching for signal and scrimping minutes hasn’t changed much since the phone came out, because carriers have little motivation for innovation. Cellular carriers make their money either way, and ‘innovation’ is charging $1,300/megabyte for text messages or adding 20 seconds of instructions on how to leave a voicemail before letting you leave a voicemail, so that they might get an extra minute’s revenue.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If technology companies were in control of the full telecom stack, you’d be able to get caller ID data for incoming cellphone calls. You’d be able to see someone’s availability before you call them, and that availability could be controlled automatically by time of day, location, current calling status (“Kevin is currently on the phone.”) and a hundred other innovations to make calling a reasonable mode of communications again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sure, a few middleware services like Google Voice (and Grand Central before them) have offered some innovation, but they’ve been limited by spotty deep OS integration and even more limited access to carrier services. They don’t let you ping a phone for status before you call or a dozen other features that can be found in IM or email clients.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then there’s the cellular network. Recent innovation in cell networks has been driven almost exclusively by mobile data needs. Most 4G-capable phones can’t even use 4G for voice calls, relying on the 3G chipset and network for calls. 4G is just for data on these phones. Got a wi-fi capable smartphone (as all modern smartphones are)? Tough, you can’t use that for calls either, unless you but a microcell for your home network so you can use 3G to access your own wi-fi network, and still pay your carrier for the minutes on calls you pipe through your own internet connection.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That’s the preamble for what’s broken, and I could go on, but I’ll get to the point: What if Microsoft’s plan is to fix it?<br>
                                To control the full mobile pipeline you’d need to control the mobile phone hardware, the mobile OS, and the carrier. It’s incredibly hard to start a new carrier, placing cell towers all over the country, so most small carriers lease capacity from one of the major players, which gives them a disadvantage when it comes to pricing. Simply layering a new network on top of the old wouldn’t work, which is why wi-fi is the way to go. Our phones already use wi-fi for data access, falling back seamlessly to the cellular network when Wi-fi isn’t available. Wi-fi is essentially free, so a ‘soft carrier’ could drastically lower their costs by routing calls over wi-fi when available.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If over half of a soft carrier’s airtime minutes were carried over wi-fi rather than a leased cellular network, that carrier could beat a national carrier on price even if the national carrier doubled their costs when they leased access to the soft carrier, and for every customer who only has 3G access there’s another who has almost exclusively wi-fi access, and over time the scales continue to tip toward the latter, steadily lowering soft-carrier costs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Microsoft has a good mobile OS, they just bought a soft carrier in Skype, and whether the rumors of a potential acquisition of Nokia pan out or not, Microsoft’s recent deal with Nokia seems to go beyond a simple OS licensee. If Microsoft is trying to turn the cellular industry on its end, it’ll start out with Nokia hardware. No other hardware manufacturer will risk pissing off their major customers (AT&amp;T, Verizon, etc.) with a move that so directly challenges their entire industry.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And of course Microsoft isn’t alone in this ambition. Apple and Google appear to have been moving to the same destination by different paths. Apple’s integration of FaceTime is a clear move toward carrier independence. In a limited sense, the iPod Touch is already a wi-fi phone. It would take very little for Apple to build its own Facetime-to-POTS gateway. In fact, I’d be amazed if they weren’t already there. Mix in Apple’s recent deals with voice recognition leader Nunace and we’re several steps closer to what Nuance calls ‘Dialtone 2.0’ where phone conversations start simply by lifting the receiver to your ear and talking to the computer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Google Voice and Google’s interest in the spectrum auctions are clear indications of their ambition in this area, and their recent moves to tighten their control on the design and feature sets of Android handsets may be another indication that changes are afoot.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The next five years are going to see as much innovation in the way we make and take calls as the last five have seen in how we use our phone for data. It’s about damned time.
                            </p>
