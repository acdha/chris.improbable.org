                                    As I write, there is a medical crisis at Antarctica's South Pole Station. Raytheon (the contractor that runs the Station) and the National Science Foundation (which is responsible for it) are refusing to authorize a medevac. Desperate relatives of the patient have <a href="http://saverenee.org/">created a website</a> to publicize the situation, and are <a href="http://www.wh.gov/4U2">petitioning the White House</a> to over-ride the contractor and agency's decision.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On August 27th Renee-Nicole Douceur, the winter site manager at the South Pole Station, suffered a stroke. The Pole doctors requested that she have an emergency medical evacuation as soon as possible: they have neither the kind of scanning equipment that could tell them what is going on in her brain, nor the kind of medication a true hospital would stock to treat a stroke patient.
                                </p>
                                <blockquote>
                                    The doctor noted on Sept. 3 that the healing is slower at the South Pole and that Renee would benefit from assessment and rehabilitation therapy as soon as possible. She also admitted that she didnâ€™t know how to rehabilitate a stroke victim. Renee has partial vision loss to both eyes, and she also has brain fatigue.
                                </blockquote>(from the <a href="http://saverenee.org/?p=73">SaveRenee FAQ</a>)

Because the ice cap glacier moves about 10 meters over the course of the year, the location of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_pole#Geography">geographic South Pole</a> seems to move with respect to the Station and has to be re-positioned on the ice cap every year. The Ceremonial Pole is where people usually get their pictures taken, but has no scientific significance.</small>
                                </p>

                                    Raytheon and the NSF claim that there will be absolutely no opportunity for a medevac before the first regularly scheduled flight, toward the end of October. And besides, they say, the stroke is "not an emergency", not worth the considerable trouble and expense of a medevac from the Pole. Even if they could, which they claim they can't.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, in <a href="http://www.polarconservation.org/education/antarctic-evacuations/2001-doctor-evacuated-from-the-south-pole">April 2001</a> there was a medical evacuation from the Pole, during the polar night. The Sun has now been <a href="http://marcopolie.blogspot.com/2011/09/sunrise.html">up for a week:</a>

                                <p>
                                    Although a medevac earlier than the scheduled transport is almost certainly technically feasible, no flight has been pre-positioned -- so even if weather conditions temporarily improve, Raytheon would not be able to take advantage of it. They clearly do not intend to move Renee earlier than the regular transport, regardless of conditions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The above is largely summarized from SaveRenee.org; the following are completely my own thoughts and research and not based on anything Renee, her family, or her friends have written, said, or implied.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Why is Raytheon being so hard-nosed about money that they're risking having an employee blinded or brain-damaged, with all the attendant risks of lawsuits, bad publicity, and bad feeling? I notice a few things:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    1. This season already saw a medical airdrop at the Pole, in the cold and dark of late August. <a href="http://www.southpolestation.com/trivia/10s/airdrop.html">It was successful</a>, but I assume it was quite expensive.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    2. There was also a <a href="http://www.pacaf.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123262352">medevac from McMurdo on June 30</a>, in the very middle of winter. McMurdo is probably an order of magnitude easier to get to than the Pole, but I'm sure this, too, was very expensive.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    3. Raytheon's <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/about/contracting/rfqs/support_ant/index.jsp">contract for running the Antarctic stations</a> is up -- actually, that's the original 10-year contract plus a one-year extension. Insofar as I understand the process, <a href="http://www.southpolestation.com/trivia/ncs/ncs.html#not">Raytheon is not one of the finalists</a> for the contract -- as of a year ago, only CH2MHILL, Lockheed Martin, and KBR were still in the running. The contract winner is being decided as I write, and should be announced in November of this year. They say.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So it looks to me a lot as though Raytheon doesn't give a damn about its future in Antarctica, or whether it will get bad publicity, much less any hypothetical human feeling for an employee -- the only consideration is that every extra penny it spends in Antarctica now will come out of its bottom line, instead of being rolled into next year's budget or otherwise cooked into the books. No wonder they're willing to act like a insurance company, playing the "Deny, Delay, Defend" game.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Renee's family is urging people to <a href="http://saverenee.org/?page_id=2">contact relevant officials at Raytheon and NSF</a>. They also are trying to get 5000 signitures on the <a href="http://www.wh.gov/4U2">White House petition</a>, which is the threshold for the White House to actually take notice. Boost the signal.
                                </p>

                                    <small>Spoolhenge is a unofficial, evolving installation at the South Pole made of industrial-size spools used to hold the miles of wire that connect the scientific sectors. Every year some (or maybe all, I don't know) of the spools are taken away as trash, but others accumulate and Polies build them into the henge.
