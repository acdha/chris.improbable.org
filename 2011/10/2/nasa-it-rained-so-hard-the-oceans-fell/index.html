                                    I spend hours a day researching what <em>New York Times</em> columnist Thomas Friedman calls “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/opinion/17friedman.html">global weirding</a>”: the destabilization of our weather system fueled by the three million tonnes of fossil fuel pollution we inject into it each hour. So it is a rare day when something shocks me as much as a recent U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) report on last year’s extreme rainfall.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As most locals know from soggy personal experience, our corner of planet Earth since last spring has been a bit wetter and <a href="http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/climatesnapshot/2011/09/27/blogs/climatesnapshot/2011/05/26/spring-forecast-increasingly-cloudyfor-decades">greyer</a> than normal. And next door, our Washington neighbours donned their gum boots and slogged through their <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/maps.php?ts=12&amp;year=2011&amp;month=3&amp;imgs%5b%5d=Statewideprank&amp;submitted=Submit">fourth wettest</a> year since 1895.

                                    Still, we got off lucky. &nbsp;Very lucky it turns out.

                                    According to <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-262">this</a> jaw-dropping NASA report, worldwide rainfall and snowfall were so extreme, in so many places last year, that sea levels fell dramatically.
                                </p>
                                <p style="text-align:center">

                                    Sea levels have been <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/keyIndicators/index.cfm">rising steadily</a> for over a century as the ever warmer ocean water expands and the world’s remaining glaciers and ice sheets melt. In fact sea levels are rising twice as fast now as they were a few decades ago. As the NASA chart above shows there have been some ups and downs but nothing in the modern satellite record comes close to the 6 mm drop worldwide last year.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While 6 mm might not sound like a lot, when collected from the surface of all our planet’s oceans it <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/08/26/sea-level-rise-has-slowed-temporarily/">adds up</a> to 26,000 gallons of water per human.

                                <p>
                                    So just where did all this missing water go?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The ringleader of the great water heist was one of the strongest La Nina cycles of recent times. La Nina shifted and altered weather patterns causing extreme precipitation to funnel into places like India, Pakistan, Australia, and northern tiers of both South and North America.

                                    In the map below, produced from NASA’s GRACE satellite data, blue indicates areas that gained water last year. The darkest blue areas gained as much as 50 mm in one year.

                                    These dark blue spots are also the sources of the world’s epic floods of the last couple years which not only left tens of millions homeless and destroyed agriculture and infrastructure, but also left behind so much water that global oceans were depleted by 6 mm.

                                    What happens in the medium and long term depends on us. We humans really have only one question to answer: To burn or not to burn?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    OPTION A: Leave most fossil fuels in the ground — forever.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    OPTION B: Keep doing what we are doing and dig up every last crumb of carbon and burn it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The climate science is clear that we cannot burn most of the fossil fuels we already know about and also have a stable enough weather system that we can continue to prosper.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As local Nobel laureate and world famous climate scientist, Andrew Weaver, explained in a <a href="http://vaninst.ca/VbWeaver.html">talk</a> at UBC the other night, just reducing the rate at which we burn fossil fuels won’t prevent dangerous levels of climate change beyond 2C warming. Instead we must totally eliminate fossil fuel emissions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Weaver showed that even if humanity cut 90% of our fossil fuel use by 2050 but kept burning that last 10% into the future, then we would still heat the climate by more than 2C. That sends us into the realm of dangerous and dramatic climate changes that Canada, USA and every major nation has stated clearly we must avoid.

                                    As Weaver summed it up:
                                </p>

                                    In Canada that means forcing our governments to take responsibility for leaving most of our fossil fuels reserves – like <a href="http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/climatesnapshot/2011/09/27/As%20the%20NASA%20report%20states:%20%E2%80%9Cwater%20flows%20downhill,%20and%20the%20extra%20rain%20will%20eventually%20find%20its%20way%20back%20to%20the%20sea.%20When%20it%20does,%20global%20sea%20level%20will%20rise%20again.%20%E2%80%98We%27re%20heating%20up%20the%20planet,%20and%20in%20the%20end%20that%20means%20more%20sea%20level%20rise%E2%80%99%22.%20Until%20we%20stop">BC coal</a>, <a href="http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/climatesnapshot/2011/09/27/world/canada/2011/04/20/big-grab-series-albertas-oil-sands-play-dirty">Alberta oil sands</a>, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/09/09/315845/natural-gas-switching-from-coal-to-gas-increases-warming-for-decades/">frackable natural gas</a> — in the ground forever.

                                    What we are doing right now — our current path – is to burn it all. We have absolutely no limits, and none planned, for any of our nation’s fossil fuel resources. Weaver was asked to summarize the current climate policies of our federal government. He responded: <em>“This will be quick. There aren’t any.”</em> Instead we are heading full tilt towards ever “weirder” and ever more extreme weather.
