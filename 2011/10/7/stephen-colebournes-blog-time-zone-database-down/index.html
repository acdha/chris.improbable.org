                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Today, the time-zone database was <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.time.tz/4133">closed down</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is perhaps easy to read that line, think it doesn't affect you, and then move on. But thats just not the case.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database">time-zone database</a> (sometimes referred to as the Olson database) is the computing world's principle source of time-zone data. It is embedded in every Unix and Java for starters, and will be used by many websites and probably by your iPhone. You may know it via the IDs, such as "Europe/London" or "America/New_York".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But, perhaps you're thinking that time-zones don't change? Well that may be true for America and the EU right now, but certainly isn't for the rest of the world. Governments change their time-zones all the time, and the decisions are frequently very political. I'd estimate there are between 20 and 100 separate changes made around the globe each year. And these can be at very short notice, triggered by earthquakes for example.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The time-zone database tracks all this information and creates a standard format file that describes it. I would show you an example of the file, but then perhaps I'd be sued....
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The database itself was run as an open source project, led by Arthur David Olson, supported by many others. The data was published as a set of files about 15 times a year, and then picked up by users everywhere.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/67760407/ASTROLABE-INC-Vs-ARTHUR-DAVID-OLSON-and-PAUL-EGGERT-Complaint">complaint</a> itself comes from <a href="http://alabe.com/" rel="nofollow">Astrolabe, Inc</a>, whose website looks like a company I would avoid doing business with.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The complaint is that Astrolabe produce a work, the "ACS Atlas", which is referenced by the time-zone database (some sources suggest that Astrolabe may have recently purchased the work). Astrolabe claim copyright over their work and thus believe that the time-zone databse should not have released their information to the public domain. The case is targetted at two private individuals - Arthur David Olson and Paul Eggert, who have hosted the website for many years.
