                            <p>
                                The leaks out of the Department of Justice about the Office of Legal Counsel memo justifying the assassination of Awlaki are undoubtedly intentional, and as Glenn Greenwald <a href="http://politics.salon.com/2011/10/10/the_real_danger_from_classified_leaks/">notes</a>, they are even worse than what Bradley Manning is accused of doing:<br>
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    It’s worthwhile to expand on one point I made at the end of <a href="http://politics.salon.com/2011/10/09/the_awlaki_memo_and_marty_lederman/singleton/">yesterday’s discussion</a> of the leaking by anonymous DOJ officials of selected portions of the Awlaki memo to <em>The New York Times</em>‘ Charlie Savage. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/emptywheel/status/122829037906313216">As Marcy Wheeler noted</a>, “<strong>What was leaked to Savage is MORE classified than anything Bradley Manning is alleged to have leaked</strong>.” But as I added last night, given that these anonymous DOJ officials appear to have been on a mission to justify the President’s assassination order as legal and just, it’s probably inadvisable to hold your breath waiting for the criminal leak investigation to begin.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This highlights a vital point: the Obama administration’s chronic, self-serving and dangerous game-playing with classified information. <em>The New York Times</em>‘ Public Editor, Arthur Brisbane, had <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/opinion/sunday/the-secrets-of-government-killing.html?ref=thepubliceditor">a good column yesterday</a> on the administration’s obsessive secrecy when it comes to assassinations, drones and the killing of U.S. citizens. With regard to the administration’s refusal even to account for the legal principles it has embraced governing whom the President can order killed, the Public Editor writes: “it should be intolerable that the question goes unanswered.”  But far worse, Brisbane notes that the administration manipulates and exploits its secrecy powers by leaking snippets to the media which glorify President Obama while concealing everything else…
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If a government employee leaks classified information that exposes wrongdoing on the part of the President or his aides or otherwise embarrasses them, he is<a href="http://politics.salon.com/2011/05/16/whistleblowers_6/">prosecuted without mercy</a>; at the same time, the President and his aides constantly leak bits of classified information (which remain classified) in order to benefit the President politically.  Thus, when it suits them, they dole out snippets of information about how the Tough, Strong President killed the Bad Guy with brutal efficiency and bravery — and how his lawyers said it was permissible — but all the details necessary to assess the accuracy of those claims and any information which contradicts them remain suppressed, and if anyone exposes them, they face lengthy prison terms.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But while The Most Transparent Adminstration Ever refuses to provide even this basic information about the Awlaki killing, it manipulates its secrecy powers to ensure that the only information that is known is information that can be used to venerate the Leader. The same thing happened with the bin Laden killing: the Obama administration has<a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/05/11/2258207/ap-files-foia-request-for-bin-laden-photos">resisted efforts</a> to declassify and disclose videos, documents and photographs regarding the raid that killed him — requests motivated by the administration’s <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/04/osama-bin-laden-killing-us-story-change">multiple inconsistent </a> and <a href="http://www.alternet.org/news/150857/7_deceptions_about_bin_laden's_killing_pushed_by_the_obama_administration/">ultimately false statements</a> about what took place and <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0511/54425.html">lingering questions</a> about what happened — but then oh-so-mysteriously showed little interest (<em>i.e.</em>, none) in <a href="http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/romenesko/141581/new-yorker-freelancer-scores-coup-with-account-of-bin-laden-raid/">discovering and punishing those</a> who orally <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/08/08/110808fa_fact_schmidle">fed </a><em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/08/08/110808fa_fact_schmidle">The New Yorker</a> </em>supposed details of the raid that produced an <a href="http://www.registan.net/index.php/2011/08/04/the-schmidle-muddle-of-the-osama-bin-laden-take-down/">uncritical hagiography</a> of those, including the President, responsible for the bin Laden killing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This game-playing with secrecy powers has been going on for quite some time. In the wake of the 2005 disclosure that the Bush adminstration was spying on Americans without warrants, we <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/nest/051222nest.htm">suddenly learned from an anonymous government leaker</a> that the Bush administration had a super-top-secret program in place to detect unusual radioactivity in the nation’s mosques and the monitoring was even conducted <em>without warrants  </em>– a leak which helpfully suggested, at the height of the NSA controversy, that Muslims in this country may be trying to radiate your children but that the administration is using super-sophisticated and stealth means even if they are a little bit illegal (just like warrantless eavesdropping) to protect and save us all. While the Bush administration was obsessed with punishing those responsible for the NSA leak — to the point of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/22/washington/22gonzales.html">publicly threatening</a> <em>The New York Times </em>with criminal prosecution<em> — </em>they, needless to say, displayed no interest in learning the identity of those who leaked their heroic efforts to detect radiation at mosques.
