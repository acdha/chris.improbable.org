                            Very common - in my more cynical moments I think this happens because opensource lacks people who are willing to perjure themselves claiming features are built in and immediately request twice the purchase price in consulting services to make the system actually work

                                A few weeks ago the government <a href="http://t.co/nJDitye7">published a report</a> on an $80 million (or thereabouts) project for the BC Ministry of Education on BCeSIS. The report recommends that will have to be scrapped in the coming years and replaced after about six years, with a new off the shelf proprietary system.

                            <p>
                                It cost <a href="http://www.kamloopsnews.ca/article/20110117/KAMLOOPS0101/301179972/-1/kamloops/education-minister-puts-future-of-bcesis-in-doubt">$11.9 million</a> a year to operate and <a href="http://www.cknw.com/Channels/Reg/NewsLocal/Story.aspx?ID=1539426">$16 million</a> to create.

                                That's right folks. BC spent $16 million and then $11 million on it a year. But it <b>does not own the source to the project</b>.
                            </p>

                                That probably doesn't surprise many people, I bet it's quite common. For me, on almost all projects I've worked on or managed, the subject of who owns the code has come up quickly in the process. The answers vary, but it's normally something like a non-exclusive license on both ends. I.e. as a developer I can re-use libraries I built of out it and as the client you can do what you like with it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I do remember one meeting with a large government and business clients and I brought up the license to the code and was shot down quickly "of course the client owns the code". Silly me.

                                What if BCeSIS was open source?

                            <p>
                                Why would have BC not have asked the consulting company not to develop this as open source software from the get go? Let's just imagine if BCeSIS had been developed as open source.
                            </p>

                                <li>We wouldn't have to acquire the license to a system we paid for.
                                </li>
                                <li>Any vendor could work on the project allowing competitive bidding around the support of the project.
                                </li>
                                <li>Other governments, school districts or agencies might have picked up the project
                                </li>
                                <li>There might just be an open source eSIS project with a "formal, structured funding mechanism".

                                If it was open source, BCeSIS might just be moving forward as other jurisdictions might have picked it up. It might be cheaper and easier to maintain. It won't be any worse.

                                Let's just play devils advocate here and see why a large project wouldn't do open source. And by open source, we mean the software developed for a project like BCeSIS. You can still have an open source project and use Oracle.

But, the government is not trying to defend a business model. The goal should be to get other jurisdictions to work on this project and get as much input as possible.

                                <li>Security. We know that security by obscurity is bogus. We aren't asking you to put the usernames or passwords to your database in the public, just code. We don't even want you to do something silly like <a href="http://www.versapay.com/company-news/pci-dss-compliance-why-merchants-need-to-care/">copy sensitive production data downstream</a>.

                                <li>There are legal ramifications. I think those have been pretty much resolved these days, if you chose an appropriate license.

                                <li>It's too much effort. If you are open by default, it actually becomes quite easy. Making things closed becomes the hard and painful part, it's amazing how quickly and easily it flips around.

                                <li>The consulting company won't let us. Then the government needs to dictate to the consulting companies or find other ones. There's plenty of them.

                                The conclusion from the report is that there a few vendors who can provide and off the shelf solution and it will be backed by Oracle, Microsoft or Java technology. I bet it won't be open source code.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's not a simple "<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/07/code-its-trivial.html">I can throw that together using Rails for 5k on a weekend</a>" project. It could be accomplished with an open source software stack and it could be done with all the code being open source. And that would present a much brighter future for the software and for the poor teachers and admininstrators who have to suffer it.
