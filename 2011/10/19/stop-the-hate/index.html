                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                I’ve noticed a significant increase lately in the number of complaints people are making about the operating systems they use, particularly Linux and most especially the storage stack. No, I’m not thinking of a certain foul-mouthed SSD salesman, who has made such kvetching the centerpiece of his Twitter persona. I’m talking about several people I know in the NoSQL/BigData world, who I’ve come to respect as very smart and generally reasonable people, complaining about things like OS caches, virtual memory in general, CPU schedulers, I/O schedulers, and so on. Sometimes the complaints are just developers being developers, which (unfortunately) seems to mean being disrespectful of developers in other specialties. Sometimes the complaints take the form of an unexamined assumption that OS facilities just can’t be trusted, get in the way, and kill performance. The meme seems to be that the way to get better application performance is to get the OS out of the way as much as possible and reinvent half of what it does within your application. That’s wrong. No matter how the complaint is framed, it’s highly likely to reflect more negatively on the complainer rather than the thing they’re complaining about.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Look, folks, operating-system developers can’t read minds. They have to build very complex, very general systems. They set defaults that suit the most common use cases, and they provide knobs to tune for something different. Learn how to use those knobs to tune for your exotic workload, or STFU. Does <b>your</b> code perform well in every possible use on every possible configuration, without tuning? Not so much, huh? I’ve probably seen your developers deliver a very loud “RTFM” when users visit mailing lists or IRC channels looking for help with a “wrong” use or config. I’ve probably seen them say far worse, even. How can the same person do that, and then turn around to complain about an OS they haven’t learned properly, and not be a hypocrite? When you do find those tuning knobs, often after having been told about them because you had already condemned the things they control as broken, don’t try and pass it off as your personal victory over the lameness of operating systems and their developers. You just turned a knob, which was put there by someone else in the hopes that you’d be smart enough to use it <b>before</b> you complained. They did the hard work – not you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’m not going to say that all complaints about operating systems are invalid, of course. I still think it’s ridiculous that Linux requires swap space even when there’s plenty of memory, and behaves poorly when it can’t get any. I think the “OOM Killer” is one of the dumbest ideas ever, and the implementation is even worse than the idea. I won’t say that operating-system documentation is all that it should be, either. Still, if you haven’t even tried to find out what you can tune through /proc and /sys and fcntl/setsockopt/*advise, or gone looking in the Documentation subdirectory of your friendly neighborhood kernel tree, or accepted an offer of help from a kernel developer who <b>came to you</b> to help make things better, you’re just in no position to complain or criticize. It’s like complaining that your manual-transmission car stalled, when you never even learned to drive it. Not knowing something doesn’t make you a fool, but complaining instead of asking does. Maybe if you actually <b>engaged</b> with your peers instead of pissing on them, they could help you build better applications.
