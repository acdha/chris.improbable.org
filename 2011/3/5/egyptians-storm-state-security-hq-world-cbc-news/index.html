                            <p>
                                Protesters stormed inside at least six of the buildings, including the agency's main headquarters in Cairo's northern Nasr City neighbourhood, confronting officers face-to-face and attacking some in a surreal reversal of roles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "We are inside, hundreds of us," Mohammed Abdel-Fattah, one of the protesters who barged into the Nasr City compound on Saturday, said in a telephone interview. "We are fetching documents and we are looking for detainees."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Cries of "Allahu akbar," or "God is great," could be heard in the background, as one of the protesters found a file with Mubarak's name on it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Around 2,500 people swept into the compound, according to the state news agency.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Abdel-Fattah said they barged in from the back doors, and the military, which had cordoned off the building, couldn't stop them. They scoured the building for official documents, many of which were already shredded in huge piles in what they believe was an attempt to hide evidence incriminating senior officials in abuses.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some also searched the building for secret detention rooms. Others prayed in the compound's mosque.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Army officers tried to get protesters out of the compound, but did not use force. One army officer rescued a state security officer from the hands of angry protesters and ushered him into a tank.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Activists posted photos on social networking sites of some the purported finds from inside the buildings. They showed underground prison cells, burned documents, men sifting through files while sitting on piles of shredded paper, videos labeled as sex tapes and entire shelves of documents on Islamists. One man posed with a bazooka.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One blogger called it Egypt's "Bastille Day."
