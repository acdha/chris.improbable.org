                            <p>
                                Last week we discussed a session from the <acronym title="American Association for the Advancement of Science">American Association for the Advancement of Science</acronym> meeting on the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/03/the-oceans-of-2050-will-there-be-any-fish-left.ars">fate of the oceans</a>. Today, we'll look at a related panel, organized by the UK's Government Office of Science and moderated by Sir John Beddington, the UK's Chief Science Advisor, which covered the "Future of Food and Farming: Challenges and Choices for Global Sustainability." Joining him were Charles Godfray from the University of Oxford; Shenggen Fan of the International Food Policy Research Institute; and incoming AAAS President Nina Fedoroff, from Pennsylvania State University. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With the global population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, many questions about food security remain unanswered, and this panel, along with a recent UK government report, seek to provide some of those answers.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Food system failures
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Professor Beddington began by giving a brief overview of the report, also entitled <a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk/foresight/our-work/projects/current-projects/global-food-and-farming-futures/reports-and-publications">The Future of Food and Farming</a>, stating that the case for urgent action in the global food system is now compelling, and denying the "foul slander that I've been buying wheat futures to drive the price up." Although he was able to inject some levity, it is a deeply serious and somewhat worrying issue. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Facing a convergence of threats, the global food system is failing. Each month, the global population grows by another 6 million, and an ever-wealthier world means one with more purchasing power, which drives up prices. Currently, with the global population at 7 billion and change, more than a billion of those go to bed hungry, and another billion suffer from malnutrition. And trends suggest that things will get worse. 2010 was the first year when more people lived in urban rather than rural environments; by 2050, we're going to need 30 percent more food and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/03/using-waste-heat-to-fill-the-bath-desalination-in-abu-dhabi.ars">40 percent more water</a> than is currently available. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beddington's key message was that not acting is not a viable option, and a radical redesign of the global food system is a must.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As laid out in the report linked above, the system is failing when it comes to both sustainability and ending hunger. Agriculture consumes around 70 percent of available water, and that figure rises to more than 80 percent in the developing world. Rivers and aquifers are being overexploited, including <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/05/not-just-oil-us-hit-peak-water-in-1970-and-nobody-noticed.ars">here in the US</a>. Of 11.5 billion hectares (about 28 billion acres) of land being used for food production, more than 25 percent has undergone human-induced soil degradation. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Agriculture is also contributing between 10 and 12 percent of the emissions that drive climate change. And, even with immediate policy changes, climate change has locked in weather changes for the next 20 years, which will have an impact on <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2008/04/predicting-climate-changes-impact-on-global-crop-production.ars">food production</a>. The 2007-08 food price spike put millions into poverty, and the signs are there that these food price spikes will continue to happen. Last year's Russian heat wave halved its harvest, and floods in Pakistan have been doing its food production no favors either.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Finding viable options
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Charles Godfrey followed Beddington's scene-setting by discussing some of the report's policy options for addressing these problems, ones that were measured against their potential for sustainability and the needs of the poorest. First off, adding new agricultural land and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/03/the-oceans-of-2050-will-there-be-any-fish-left.ars">fisheries</a> is a nonstarter. While it might have been an option 50 years ago, today no one is realistically going to plow up the Amazon and Congo basins—it would be insane both ecologically and economically. Existing agricultural land can be restored, but sustainable intensification of current farming practices will be critical. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The report calls for more innovation to increase production. That means using the potential benefits of GM crops and other biotech approaches, although these won't be a cure-all. There's room for improvement on the consumption end, too, as 30 percent of food never makes it into a human stomach; in the developed world, we let produce slowly rot in the backs of our fridges, and the developing world, farm wastage causes a similar problem.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We will also need to address the threat of future volatility in the food system, which is likely to increase, driven by climate change and amplified by political and economic factors. According to Godfrey, we will need reliable rules-based international trade. More research is also needed on global and national systems of grain reserves. These food reserves could be combined with appropriate insurance for poor farmers so they're not just a drain on national finances. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Focusing on food production to end hunger should show a triple benefit. It makes food, but it also increases rural income, and reaches sectors of society that aren't well served now, such as women in the developing world. Reform also means engaging with producers and dealing with issues such as land grabs and land rights. Godfrey argued that this doesn't mean that either small holders or huge agrifarms are the answer—there will need to be a balance.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Climate change, and the challenges of a low-emission world, will also need to be taken into account. Farming accounts for at least 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions; include land conversion, and this rises to 30 percent. Methane is produced by ruminants and rice farming, and nitrates from fertilizers. These will need to be included in future climate negotiations, assuming we're actually able to make those work. Godfrey noted that we're also going to need to align conservation, biodiversity and food security agendas.

                                Food security in the developing world
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                <acronym title="International Food Policy Research Institute">IFPRI</acronym>'s Shenggen Fan discussed the problem of food security in emerging and developing economies. The lofty Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger is off-track; it aimed to reduce the number of people in hunger to 584 million by 2015, but projections suggest that number will be closer to a billion. Twenty-nine countries, mainly in Africa (but also in Asia), have <a href="http://www.ifpri.org/publication/2010-global-hunger-index">alarming or extremely alarming levels of hunger</a>. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rising energy prices influence food security, with a correlation between food price and oil price that has become stronger over time, first increasing food production costs, and later by encouraging the diversion of food stocks into biofuel production. Fan also stressed similar policies to the ones suggested by Godfrey: promoting agricultural growth (although this won't fix everything), and a new development agenda that addresses price volatility, biofuel subsidies and mandates, and provides global physical grain reserves for times of emergencies. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This won't fix everything, especially for countries that suffer from famine, given that famines are usually political in nature. Food shortages can often be overcome by having people move to where there is food, or having food brought in, so famines happen when that kind of mobility is prevented, usually by men with guns.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nina Fedoroff summarized the challenges, stressing that we will need to reduce our agricultural footprint, use of fresh water, pollution, and adapt crops for a hotter, drier world—all at the same time as doubling global food supply. She praised the role of biotech and molecular crop improvement; transgenic crop Bt maize has the potential to reduce the 25 million annual cases of pesticide poisoning. But the promise of GM has been very slow to materialize; after 50 years, we only have GM cotton, canola, and soy. Even golden rice is not on the market, having been held up in regulatory testing for over a decade. Changing this will require better public acceptance and a relaxation of regulations. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fedoroff also stressed the need to rethink agriculture as a complete system. Currently, there's far too much nitrogenation, in part because we grow lots of grain to feed animals, but make little use of the plant nutrients that animals excrete. Major crops are very water-inefficient, yet we're depleting non-renewable water resources to grow temperate crops in non-temperate regions. In Saudi Arabia, 88 percent of the water went to grain production until 2008, at which point its wheat production collapsed. The country switched to other crops, but their aquifers are predicted to be empty within 25-30 years. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Water-efficient agriculture is possible. <a href="http://www.seawatergreenhouse.com/">Restorative aquaculture</a> technology and techniques can cycle nutrients between crops and aquaculture, even making use of saltwater without desalination. Fedoroff suggested we learn from the organic system, but do it smartly, avoiding many of its <a href="http://blog.sustainablog.org/five-key-limitations-of-organic-farming/">key limitations</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In a message that wasn't popular with everyone attending the session, Fedoroff said that we need to stop romanticizing small farmers. The solutions to future food production can't and shouldn't be an either-or between them and large agrifarms. She claimed that big food companies' objectives do align with sustainability needs, but they're villainized unreasonably. Nestlé benefits from adopting small farm techniques that decrease contamination, and farmers benefit from stable access to customers. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The major impediment to reform is getting these ideas adopted as policy in multiple nations. Many of these arguments have been made for a decade now, but with little progress outside of the pages of journals and official reports. Ultimately, people have short attention spans, and, although crises get attention, when price spikes end, people stop thinking about the problem and ignore the underlying trends.
