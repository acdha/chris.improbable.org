                                <i>By</i> <i>Parker Donham</i><br>
                                <br>
                                On March 7, here at <i>The Atlantic,</i> Alexis Madrigal marked the 135th anniversary of Alexander Graham Bell's patent for the telephone by reproducing <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/03/bells-early-sketch-of-a-telephone-135-years-after-he-patented-it/72120/">Bell's quirky sketch</a> of the device, submitted as part of the patent application. Later, Alexis linked to more of Bell's "<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/03/alexander-graham-bells-delightfully-weird-sketchbooks/72281/">delightfully weird sketches</a>," which he found in a Library of Congress <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/bellhtml/bellhome.html">online archive</a> of the Bell family's papers.
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <br>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                Bell was 29 when he received the patent, which made him a wealthy man. He spent much of the next half-century pursuing eclectic interests in aviation, sheep genetics, and water desalination at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beinn_Bhreagh,_Nova_Scotia">Beinn Bhreagh</a>, a gorgeous estate a few miles across the Bras d'Or Lake from my home. Bell is still a big deal around here, and Parks Canada operates <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/ns/grahambell/index.aspx">a museum</a> in his honor at nearby Baddeck, Nova Scotia.
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <br>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                Alexis's posts prompted me to explore the LOC's online database, where I turned up a curious episode in which Bell wrote President Theodore Roosevelt, asking him to intercede in the case of a black employee's Jim Crow treatment at the hands of Nova Scotia hoteliers. The story provides a rare glimpse into the Bell family's surprisingly progressive social attitudes.

                                Charles F. Thompson was nominally Bell's butler, but biographer Robert Bruce more aptly describes him as the absent-minded inventor's "chief proxy in coping with the gritty details of domestic life." Thompson was 18 and living in a Washington rooming house when he met the Bells in 1887. Fire had broken out in the Bells' nearby home, and while quickly extinguished, it left Bell's papers in disarray and suffering water damage. A housekeeper recruited the rooming house residents to help clean up. Thompson proved adept at the rare skill of deciphering Bell's scrawled handwriting, and this led to a permanent position.
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <br>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                Like Bell, Thompson eventually became a frequent seasonal resident of Baddeck. On a visit to nearby Sydney in late November, 1904, he and his wife tried to check into the Grand Hotel, but were turned away. In a severe downpour, they were rejected at four other hotels, before finding refuge at a sixth.
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <br>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                When Thompson returned to Baddeck with a serious cold, Bell and his circle of friends in the town were outraged. The inventor wrote first to the U.S. Consul in Sydney:
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <br>
                            </div>
                            <blockquote style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 40px;border:medium none;padding:0px">
                                <div>
                                    I know Mr. Thompson very well as he has been in my employment for about twenty years, if not more," he wrote the consul. "He is an upright, conscientious man in whom I have the highest confidence. He has traveled with me in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, France, Italy and Great Britain, as well as in Japan and the Hawaiian Islands, and never outside of his own country has he been discriminated against on account of his color except in Sydney, Cape Breton Island -- at least so far as I know.
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    <br>
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    However one may deplore the existence of the color line in certain parts of the United States, we have hotels there specially for colored people, so that the exclusion of a respectable colored man from a public hotel in our country does not work the hardship it does in Sydney. Exclusion from six of the hotels of Sydney resulted in turning these people out into the cold and wet, during one of the most severe storms of the season without a place where they could lay their heads...
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    <br>
                                </div>
                                <div>
                                    Mr. Thompson is now lying ill in my house here as the result of the exposure, and his wife also is far from well. I propose to call the attention of the State Department in Washington to the necessity of providing protection for colored citizens of the United States in Canada -- so as to prevent the possibility of the repetition of another such outrage as this. There is nothing in the appearance of Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, or in their manners or characters to justify exclusion from any hotel. There is so little of the negro in Mr. Thompson's appearance that he has often -- in foreign countries -- been taken for a Japanese, while his wife might well pass for Spanish.

                                    We do not understand why a respectable couple (as we all know you to be) although colored, should be turned away from any Hotel, and we sincerely hope that you and Mrs. Thompson may long be spared to spend many summers on Canadian soil and receive treatment from the hands of the public that a gentleman of your esteem so well deserves.

                                Further poking around the Bell's online papers turned up Mabel Hubbard Bell's reflections on a farewell dance she staged for Thompson two years earlier, as he was preparing the leave Baddeck for Washington, where he was to be married. Mrs. Bell, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabel_Gardiner_Hubbard">a redoubtable figure</a> in her own right, wrote:

                                    I realized last night how impossible it would have been to have given an entertainment like that in Washington. The farmers and farm help might have been invited, <u>but</u> <u>they</u> <u>would</u> <u>not</u> <u>have</u> <u>come</u> -- to greet a colored man -- and associate on equal terms with him -- the white girls would not have danced with a colored man like Charles -- even though -- as in this case -- he might have been gentlemanly in appearance and better educated than themselves.

                                Alas, the Sydney episode was probably more typical of racial attitudes that prevailed in Nova Scotia at the time. Nova Scotia was a terminus for the Underground Railway, and more recent history is replete with examples of racism (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africville">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_Desmond">here</a>). Thompson's close association with the revered AGB undoubtedly played a key role in his acceptance by the Baddeck community.
