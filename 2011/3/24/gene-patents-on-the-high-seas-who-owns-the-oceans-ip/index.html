                            <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/03/gene-patents-reach-the-high-seas.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss"><img vspace="4" hspace="4" border="0" align="right" width="230" height="129" src="http://static.arstechnica.net/brief_icons/science-brief.png"></a>
                            <p>
                                On land, the future of gene patents looks like it might be <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/03/decision-over-breast-cancer-tests-hammers-gene-patents.ars">a bit shaky</a> in some countries, but globally, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity has established formal rules for patenting and profiting from natural products, including genes. As a Policy Forum in today's issue of <em>Science</em> points out, though, the CoBD has a major gap: it covers things found on land and within a country's territorial waters, but does not apply at all to anything found in international waters.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ignoring the oceans makes little sense. We've already got treaties in place to handle mineral resources in the deep oceans, and all indications are that the biological riches present there may be significant. Molecules derived from marine resources and used for medical applications were worth over $1 billion in 2005, and heat-stable enzymes obtained at undersea vents were worth $150 million. Not surprisingly, the business community has responded by patenting genes derived from marine organisms; the authors were able to identify over 8,500 sequences derived from a total of 520 species in a US gene patent database.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Those patents have been anything but evenly distributed. Three nations—the US, Germany, and Japan—account for 70 percent of them. Based on the trends, the authors suspect it's a "rich get richer" scenario. The countries that have well-developed biotechnology industries and genomic technology are best positioned to identify genes with a potential commercial value, which should help further expand their biotech industry.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The role of genomic technology may be key going forward. Researchers are now sequencing vast collections of DNA derived from collections of open-ocean species, and identifying interesting genes without ever bothering to culture the species that carry them. These gene fishing trips can provide a wealth of potentially patentable material, but only to those countries that have the DNA sequencing infrastructure in place.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In general, the authors of the Forum favor what seems to have worked for mineral rights and biological materials on land: an international agreement forged under the auspices of the UN. But they also suggest that, in the case of marine materials, a patent pool organized within this framework might improve access to genetic information and distribute the risk and profits broadly among far more nations, rather than limiting it to the few countries that can afford high-throughput DNA sequencing.
