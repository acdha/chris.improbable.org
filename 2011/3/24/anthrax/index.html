                            <p>
                                <strong>By Thoreau</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/03/ff_anthrax_fbi/all/1">Wired has an interesting article on the case against Bruce Ivins.</a> After reading it, I can certainly say the following against Ivins:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                1)&nbsp; Based on some of the inconsistencies and errors in his assistance offered to the FBI, he is not a man to be trusted.&nbsp; That is more than enough reason to terminate his employment at a military lab that handles deadly germs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2)&nbsp; While I don’t like convicting people of crimes based on how weird they are, the vandalism and stalking that he admitted to would seem further disqualification from doing high security work with dangerous germs.&nbsp; The weird, secretive behavior also calls into question whether he is susceptible to blackmail.&nbsp; My understanding is that susceptibility to blackmail is not desirable in an employee who works with a security clearance.&nbsp; Of course, susceptibility to blackmail also opens various other possibilities in a case like this, if you want to get a touch conspiratorial.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                3)&nbsp; The circumstantial case against him is certainly ample justification for considering him a suspect.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, there is a big difference between considering somebody a likely suspect and actually proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Near the end of the article, they point out some of the weaknesses in the case.&nbsp; I’m not an expert on the relevant science, so I won’t comment on that except to note that the experts don’t consider the case closed.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the FBI was relying heavily on Ivins early in the investigation, and if he had several years of access to the materials that he worked with, it isn’t clear how anybody will ever be able to put together a reliable case against him.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I will observe the following:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                1)&nbsp; All of the timeline evidence concerning his whereabouts at key times of possible mailing trips is at best circumstantial and in many cases speculative.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2)&nbsp; Motive never really comes up.&nbsp; So there’s a weird and crazy guy who hates NYC and Kappa Kappa Gamma.&nbsp; Why were anthrax letters sent to the Senate?&nbsp; It may be as simple as “Crazy guys don’t always make sense” but it is still interesting that after all of this digging into his weird psyche they find little/no evidence of a motive to attack the targets that he attacked.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                3)&nbsp; Related to motive, nothing is said about his financial situation.&nbsp; The FBI speculates on some motive relating to funding for vaccine research, but nothing is said about his personal finances, the funding situation for his lab prior to the attacks, or any connections to vaccine companies or start-ups. They don’t even say much to indicate whether he had a strong interest in vaccines (either a scientific interest or some hobbyhorse rant about how “They really oughta fund this stuff more!”).&nbsp; And if you want to get a touch conspiratorial, nobody says anything about whether he had money problems that somehow got easier after the attacks, or if he subsequently bought an unexpectedly nice car or whatever.&nbsp; I’m just sayin’.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                More generally, I was under the impression that finances were one of the first things that detectives check any time they are investigating a suspect, because so many dirty deeds are done for money.&nbsp; It could very well be that nothing came up so the author left it out, but I am genuinely curious what (if anything) they found.&nbsp; My understanding is that while the real-life FBI (not to be confused with the movie version) has its SWAT teams and bad asses and shrinks and CSI teams and hackers and wiretappers, they have even more accountants, who mostly track dirty money and see what suspects are doing with money or for money.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, the case as stated sounds very plausible but hardly convincing.&nbsp; As long as we’re all playing armchair detective/psychologist here, let me offer another scenario:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Bruce Ivins is a weirdo who has a lot of secrets and spends a lot of time off the radar.&nbsp; He’s good at keeping his life compartmentalized.&nbsp; And somebody who wants anthrax for his own purposes, and who has access to dossiers on people in high-security labs, puts these pieces together.&nbsp; So this person gets to know Ivins in some capacity, and through some mixture of feigned friendship and/or blackmail and/or bribery, gets Ivins to hand something over.&nbsp; Now, in the movies, Ivins would finally crack and say to investigators “I didn’t do it, but if you give me immunity I’ll tell you who did…” and then a sniper takes him out before he can talk.&nbsp; In real life, Ivins knows that he’s done something very bad, he knows enough about the physical evidence to suspect that they’ll never be able to build a conclusive case, and he doesn’t know how sweet a deal will actually be.&nbsp; And once&nbsp; you start talking about a deal, you’ve as much as admitted it.&nbsp; So talking is not necessarily the smart move.&nbsp; Especially if he actually knows very little about the person that he gave it to.&nbsp; What’s he going to say?&nbsp; “Seven years ago, I spent a lot of time chatting in outdoor areas, away from security cameras and away from surfaces that retain fingerprints, with a guy who used a fake name and a cell phone that was listed under a fake name and paid me in small bills with non-consecutive serial numbers?”&nbsp; By the time it’s all falling apart, Ivins is even less stable and not necessarily thinking about all of his options, he doesn’t think anybody will believe his story, and maybe he’s received some sort of threat (although that last part is less likely, if the FBI is checking his email and tapping his calls).&nbsp; So he swallows pills and booze.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I don’t consider this the most likely scenario.&nbsp; I consider it the third most likely scenario, with “Ivins did it” and “Somebody else did it” being more likely.&nbsp; I’m agnostic on which of those two is most likely.&nbsp; Still, when your case against a guy has a big chunk of “And he’s so weird that he could TOTALLY be blackmailed!” in it, it needs to be considered.
                            </p>
