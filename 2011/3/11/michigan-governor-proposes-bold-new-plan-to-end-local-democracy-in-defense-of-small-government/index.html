                                The rap on Michigan Governor Rick Snyder was that he was supposed to be the most moderate of the new crop of Republican governors. It turns out that he’s just really a very good liar, and he’s substantially more radical than even someone like Scott Walker. Just <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/erikkain/2011/03/11/michigan-governor-plays-fast-and-loose-with-democracy-invokes-radical-new-powers/">read this and tell me I’m wrong</a>:

                                    Snyder’s law gives the state government the power not only to break up unions, but to <em>dissolve entire local governments</em> and place appointed “Emergency Managers” in their stead. But that’s not all – whole <em>cities</em> could be eliminated if Emergency Managers and the governor choose to do so. And Snyder can <em>fire elected officials</em> unilaterally, without any input from voters. It doesn’t get much more anti-Democratic than that.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Except it does. The governor simply has to declare a financial emergency to invoke these powers – or he can hire a private company to declare financial emergency and take over oversight of the city. That’s right, a private corporation can declare your city in a state of financial emergency and send in its Emergency Manager, fire your elected officials, and reap the benefits of the ensuing state contracts.

                                I guess we can call this Michigan’s Mubarak Statute. Seriously, though, how can this even be legal? I don’t know anything about Michigan’s constitution, but surely this sort of thing can’t just happen, right? It would be as if President Obama could just fire governors at will. (Actually, come to think of it…okay, no, just kidding.) Perhaps Metavirus might have some insight into this. I just think it’s appalling.

                                Kain distills the point nicely: “There is nothing limited about a state government that can erase entire cities or take control of school districts and local governments with the swipe of a pen.” I’m hopeful because these moves in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio are not going down smoothly, and the backlash resulting from them might well be enough to reverse the tide. And <a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2011/03/11/are_independents_warming_to_more_government.html">data like this</a> make me think that the public is quietly backing away from the Republicans, just that it’s not reached a tipping point yet. It can’t come soon enough for me.

                                I can’t believe I’m going to say this, but this guy makes me wish that Pete Hoekstra had won the Republican primary. Considering <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/08/ode-to-hoekstra-tpm-bids-farewell-to-a-national-security-freak.php">what a huge clown that guy is</a>, that’s saying something.

I'm certainly in favor of more local control, so I'm philosophically opposed to this kind of move in general (as are pretty much all fellow small government advocates, including E.D.Kain himself obviously). And "Emergency Manager" does indeed sound dystopian. But as a practical matter, Michigan is a politically and governmentally awful state with an awful lot of cleaning up to be done, so this may be for the best--in the same way something like martial law can be the best (not that I'm drawing any sort of broader equivalence here). The chief negative is that, as with similar oversteps by the federal government in FDR's days, power centralizations like this one tend to be perniciously permanent. Anyway, I also speak with no knowledge of Michigan's constitution, but knowing what I do about state autonomy and their often silly constitutions, I'd bet heavily on Snyder's law being legal.
