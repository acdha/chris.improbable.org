                                    Several recent studies have suggested that the gender gap in STEM fields is caused not by bias, but simply by different choices made by men and women. What the new research shows, Dasgupta said, is choice isn’t as simple as people think. “<strong>People assume that these choices are free choices, based on talent and interest and motivation</strong>,” Dasgupta said. “But these data suggest that <strong>the meaning of choices, of what it means to choose math or science, is more complicated</strong>. Even talented people may not choose math or science <strong>not because they don’t like it or are not good at it, but because they feel that they don’t belong</strong>.”

                                There is a common belief among some computer geek communities that women are underrepresented in STEM because we just don’t like it, and so we should <em>celebrate differences</em> instead of <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2011/01/03/sexism-in-geek-communities-more-important-than-gender-imbalance/">making women “miserable” by “forcing” us into careers we “don’t like”</a>. This study would debunk that myth, if only most men in tech who discuss the topic of women in tech actually did some research on it, instead of leaving comments that <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2010/07/07/male-geeks-reclaim-masculinity-at-the-expense-of-female-geeks/" title="Male geeks reclaim masculinity at the expense of female geeks.">make male geeks feel good about themselves</a> and rationalize the gender imbalance in “their” field.

                                For other male geeks who insist that there are hard-wired brain differences in men and women, and <a href="http://restructure.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/gender-difference-in-math-ability-variability-driven-by-social-inequality-study/" title="Gender difference in math ability variability driven by social inequality, not biology – study">argue that women’s brains are hard-wired against understanding math and science as well as men</a> (instead of hard-wired against <em>enjoying</em> math and science), this part of the article should be emphasized:

                                    Skeptics might wonder if some of the [gender] differences [in engagement] among students relate to how well the students know the material. The researchers checked for that and found that, <strong>across sections, women outperformed men on grades</strong>. So the data point to women losing confidence with male instructors — even if female students know the material as well as or better than their male counterparts.
