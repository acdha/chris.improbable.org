                            <p>
                                Meeting the 21st century's energy needs is a frequent topic at the annual meetings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). In the past we've <a href="http://arstechnica.com/search/#AAAS+energy">covered many sessions</a> on a range of topics from solar to nuclear and beyond. One thing is quite evident at this point: there will be no single replacement for our current dependence on coal, gas, and oil. Rather, we'll (hopefully) implement many new technologies, each with its own niche. In this, and one or two future posts, I'll look into some of the ways that we can use waste products that we'd normally throw away to provide power. And I'm going to start in the farmyard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yes, that's right, manure. Normally, when we think of biofuels, we think of corn ethanol, or <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/03/switching-biofuels-could-do-a-double-whammy-on-climate-change.ars">switchgrass</a>, or <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/02/aaas-2011-biorefineries-as-a-route-forward.ars">bioengineered organisms</a>, but these either have problems or aren't yet ready for market. Meanwhile, there are a lot of cows and pigs that have something more to offer than being eaten. Frank Mitloehner at UC Davis spoke at the AAAS meeting in February about a project underway at the Californian university, as well as at universities in Germany, that make use of farmyard waste and leftover food to keep the lights on and the water hot.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As Dr. Mitloehner pointed out, it's a significant untapped energy source. California's population is predicted to grow to 54 million by 2050, and the biggest growth will be in agricultural areas. Already, the San Joaquin Valley has the nation's highest number of dairies, at over 2,000, and these pump out more than 280 million pounds of manure each day. It's not just manure, though. Crop residue (the bits left over after harvesting and processing) and food processing byproducts are also left on the table, so to speak. Well, not so much left on the table as chipped up and buried in landfills, or just left to rot.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now UC Davis is making use of up to eight tons of agricultural byproducts, leftover food, and biomass from municipal waste (think paper and cardboard) a day to generate as much 1200 kW hours/day. It does this by dumping all that waste into a bioreactor or digester where helpful anaerobic bacteria break down the organic matter and generate methane, which can either be used for electrical power generation or converted into ethanol or even hydrogen. And every ton of waste that UC Davis sticks into its bioreactor is a ton of waste it doesn't have to pay tipping fees on, so it's a double win.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Local power generation ought to be part of our future energy plans. There are pretty big inefficiencies in long-distance power transmission, and the monumental task of upgrading the nation's grid requires the sort of long-term planning and large capital investment to which, for some reason, we've become allergic. But whether it is solar power on the flat roofs of big box stores or bioreactors in farming areas, making power locally should be much less hassle. Already in Germany there are over 8,000 bioreactors in farming towns and villages, providing hot water and electricity. In India, people are working on an even smaller scale, with household bioreactors that provide enough methane to cook the family meal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sadly, here in the US, there are only about 100 such bioreactors, thanks to huge regulatory and legislative barriers that vary from state to state and municipality to municipality. But just when I was getting depressed about this, I discovered that plans are underway in Washington DC (where I live) to build a bioreactor, the first in the nation to use thermal hydrolysis. DC Water expects to generate 13 MW of electricity a year at its Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant. The plant, due to come online in 2014, <a href="http://pwmag.com/industry-news.asp?sectionID=760&amp;articleID=1481421">will first heat and pressurize</a> the sludge to kill off any pathogens, at the same time making it easier for the anaerobic bacteria to turn yesterday's lunch into tomorrow's methane. DC Water will get a double benefit from feeding solid waste into the digester, as they expect to significantly reduce the amount of biosolids that have to be trucked off to Virginia and elsewhere.
