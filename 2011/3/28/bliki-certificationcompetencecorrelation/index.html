                            This is a long-time, persistent problem in our industry. There are a few certifications which actually mean something (e.g. the Cisco exams which require hands-on diagnosis &amp; repair of a realistic network) but even those have been drowned out by similar-sounding, far less rigorous certifications which require little more than short-term memory.
                        </p>

                                Most of my friends and colleagues are very negative about certification schemes in software development, a disdain that I share. This doesn't mean that I think that certifications in software are bad by definition, just that almost every one we see fails a basic test.
                            </p><img src="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/images/certificationCompetenceCorrelation/sketch.png">
                            <p>
                                For a certification to be useful, it needs a correlation with competence in the thing that it certifies. So if Alice has a certification in, say, clojure programming; then there should be a high probability that Alice is a competent clojure programmer. High probability isn't a guarantee, but it should be significantly higher than the general programmer population. The reason we have disdain for most software certification programs is because we've not seen such a correlation (indeed sometimes we feel there's a negative correlation).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, the fact that most certification schemes lack this correlation means that I tend to judge such schemes as guilty until proven innocent. This includes new schemes, which is why I've been deeply wary of getting involved in new certification programs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A useful certification scheme, one with a respectable competence correlation, would be a Good Thing - particularly if it had a broad focus. Such a scheme would make it easier to hire someone for a task. At the moment the only way you can tell if someone is a good programmer is to find other good programmers to assess their ability. Such assessment is difficult, time-consuming, and needs to be repeated by each hiring organization. If you are a non-programmer looking to hire someone, such an assessment is particularly daunting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What makes the situation worse is that certification schemes, even the useful ones, are prone to corruption. If you can get recognition for a certification scheme, there is a good money-making opportunity there: courses, assessments, books etc. Sadly there doesn't seem to be much correlation between a certification's ability to make money and its usefulness.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Is it reasonable for a competent person to acquire a useless certification? I wish I could answer no, but the reality is that a certification is often used as an entry gate, even if it is useless. As a result competent people often need a useless certification in order get an interview. (I suppose you could argue that this makes the certification useful, at least in an economic sense, but I prefer to stick with competence correlation.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I do think that if you hold a useless certification, you should never try to imply that it means anything. Indeed you should take what opportunities you can to educate people about its uselessness. Lousy certifications are a canker to our profession and we should work as much as we can to remove them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many people I know and respect offer certifications as part of their training courses. This is bad in that it reinforces the canker, but on the whole I sympathize. Many organizations will only send people on a course if it comes with a certification, and I think it's reasonable to offer a certification to help bring people to a valuable course. Furthermore, as I discussed above, it is reasonable for people to get a useless certification, and I would rather them gain such a certification in a useful course.
                            </p>
