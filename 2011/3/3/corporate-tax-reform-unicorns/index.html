                                    Congress is apparently likely to consider corporate tax reform this year. As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/business/economy/02leonhardt.html">David Leonhardt of the New York Times reported</a>,
                                </p>

                                    Arguably, the United States now has a corporate tax code that's the worst of all worlds. The official rate is higher than in almost any other country, which forces companies to devote enormous time and effort to finding loopholes. Yet the government raises less money in corporate taxes than it once did, because of all the loopholes that have been added in recent decades.
                                </blockquote>The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities[1] wrote a <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3411">report</a> outlining <a href="http://www.offthechartsblog.org/what-should-corporate-tax-reform-look-like/">What Should Corporate Tax Reform Look Like?</a>

                                        I find these proposals thoughtful, well-intentioned, and meaningless.
                                        <p>
                                            How could they *not* be perceived and attacked as tax increases? A lot of people agree that "close the loopholes, lower the rates" is a good general formula -- but if it ends up with more corporate tax revenue being collected, it's a <b>tax increase</b>. I think corporations are too powerful (with Democrats as well as Republicans) and too united on this issue for <b>any</b> increase in the actual taxes they pay to be politically feasible.
                                        </p>

                                            A number of commenters at the NYT argue that corporate taxes should either be eliminated (and replaced with a VAT or similar), or that corporations, who are "persons", should pay income tax like the rest of us persons. My worry about the former is that it would lead to an even more regressive system than what we've got (though I don't have experience living in a VAT-based society, so tell me more); my worry about the later is that it is a unicorn-based pipe dream. Or a pipe-based unicorn dream, or something.

                                            Unicorns: as difficult to track down as corporate tax reform. But prettier.[2]
                                        </p>

                                            My basic attitude toward taxes, btw, is that "flat" or "fair" taxes <b>aren't</b>. Fairness is measured not by how much you pay, but by how much it hurts. For a family with an income of $40K (we've been there), 10% is very hard. For a family income of $200K, 10% is easy. With an income of $20M, 10% is peanuts. A tax code based on "flat pain distribution" would probably have Eisenhower-era rates. I am OK with that, but I think the idea is smokin' with the unicorns.

                                        [1] They call themselves "non-partisan", but since they work "at the federal and state levels on fiscal policy and public programs that affect low- and moderate-income families and individuals", I feel secure calling them "left-of-center".
