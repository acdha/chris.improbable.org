                            <p>
                                "Why in gods green earth are we attack [sic] a toilet paper company?" asked one Anonymous member this week on an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel devoted to planning the group's operations. The target in question was the website of Angel Soft toilet paper, owned by Georgia-Pacific, which is in turn owned by Koch Industries, which is controlled by the two Koch brothers, Charles and David, who have funneled their vast wealth into Tea Party and libertarian causes for years. The site stayed up.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anonymous doesn't like the Kochs (the group is currently attempting to "Kochblock" them, without much success). Indeed, it doesn't like a lot of people. Anonymous "operations" have proliferated faster than a meme on 4chan, the imageboard from which Anonymous emerged years ago.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Consider the current (partial) list of targets:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Wisconsin's governor (for trying to revoke some collective bargaining rights of public unions) #opwisconsin
                                </li>
                                <li>The Koch brothers, Koch Industries, and various holdings, especially if toilet-related (Quilted Northern was attacked over the weekend) #opkochblock
                                </li>
                                <li>Major copyright holders #operationpayback
                                </li>
                                <li>The Libyan government #oplibya
                                </li>
                                <li>Bank of America #operationBOA
                                </li>
                                <li>Egypt #opegypt
                                </li>
                                <li>Security firm Palantir (a continuation of the #ophbgary work)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/02/empty-suit-the-chaotic-way-that-anonymous-makes-decisions.ars">Westboro Baptist Church</a> (hit hard after trolling Anonymous mercilessly)
                                </li>
                                <li>Glenn Beck (though the idea has yet to gain much traction)
                                </li>
                                <li>The government of Sweden (for prosecuting WikiLeaks' Julian Assange)
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The list goes on and on. But as the targets have spread, the effectiveness of the attacks on them appears to have diminished. Even when much of the Anonymous interest was on #opwisconsin over the weekend, the group's vaunted distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks could only take down right-wing strongholds like Americans for Prosperity, Koch Industries, and Club for Growth for short periods of time. Several targets, including the government of Sweden, appeared impervious.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A strength of Anonymous is the bottom-up nature of its targeting and planning; anyone who wants to start a new op simply starts one and tries to corral enough interest to execute it. But it also makes it hard to focus.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Last year, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/09/operation-payback-attacks-continue-until-we-stop-being-angry.ars">when unified behind Operation Payback</a> (which targeted copyright holders, then WikiLeaks adversaries), Anonymous took down just about every site it targeted, including the RIAA, MPAA, US Copyright Office, MasterCard, Visa, and Swiss bank PostFinance. Even PayPal was affected enough that it <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/news/2010/12/fbi-raids-texas-colocation-facility-in-anonymous-ddos-probe.ars">called in the FBI</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This week, Angel Soft's double-ply comfort defeated the now-<em>extremely</em>-distributed denial of service attacks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even Anons are getting fed up. "We cannot afford to tackle every opponent that dares to confront us, or to corrupt our numerous societies," says one representative press release. (Such press releases can be authored by anyone and, as such, do not represent anything like an "official" Anonymous viewpoint.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Everyday, there are new operations," it continues. "Some even in the same exact topic. For the revolutions happening amongst our eastern brethren, there is an operation for each country. This does NOT help gain support. This does NOT make matters simpler. This will only cause more problems than solve them. Anonymous, we should work to consolidate our tactics."
                            </p>

                                What is Anonymous up to? Anything and everything its various self-identified members propose. These ideas are often in conflict, with one of the most potent debates occurring between those who attack "for the lulz" versus those who act out of ethical and moral imperatives (the so-called "moralfags").
                            </p>

                                While many members want to promote democracy, stand up for free speech, and push transparency (on governments and corporations), others just want to stir the pot.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "We laugh in the face of tragedy," said <a href="http://anonnews.org/?p=press&amp;a=item&amp;i=658">one post</a> on open-posting site AnonNews, "we mock those in pain, we ruin the lives of other people simply because we can, these things we do for the lolz [sic] and we do them with no remorse, no caring, no love, and no sense of morality, we attack all things in this way, we can, we will, and we have destroyed countless that stand to harm Anonymous."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some of the "moralfags" have left the main "Anonymous" tent to set up small camps of their own nearby. This happened recently with the group calling itself "Magnanimous," which objected to some Anonymous tactics and targets. Magnanimous has worked with Anonymous on the "ToiletWars" over the weekend, however, saying that "some Koch related targets took a beating as well."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While Anonymous takes as its motto the tag:
                            </p>
                            <pre>

We are Legion.

                            <p>
                                Magnanimous adopted its own logo and altered the Anonymous motto:
                            </p>
                            <pre>

We do not negotiate.

                            <p>
                                Not all Anons took kindly to this move. One Anon <a href="http://anonnews.org/?p=press&amp;a=item&amp;i=671">called them out</a>, saying, "Anonymous cannot participate in joint operations; with anyone. We are everyone. You are a portion of Anonymous. We act as one. Cease using a separate title. The only possible implementation of a different title is in order to take claim for your actions; making you a disgusting little group that requires credit for the actions you take."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The end result was predictable. On Tuesday night, Magnanimous leader "antivigilante" entered the Anonymous chat rooms in spectacular style:
                            </p>

                                The cause of antivigilante's anger was simple: someone had taken over the main Magnanimous blog, defacing it with an Anonymous image, and then moved on to his Twitter account, which was also defaced.

                                Keeping track of Anonymous targets, priorities, and operations can be dizzying. In the last few days, various Anons have proposed a whole new set of operations, including:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Operation Sockmonkey ("Use artificial debate between multiple personae to dominate online discussions through exaggeration, false consensus, etc.")
                                </li>
                                <li>Operation WakeUp ("Simply Wake Up on March 9th and know, the world is one—think about this on March 9th. We are together on this planet.")
                                </li>
                                <li>Operation Icarus ("Attention Brothers: The opportunity to create financial chaos and public unrest and from that, there will be a previously unachieved amount of lulz to be had. Charge your lasers and aim them at the the New York Stock Exchange.")
                                </li>
                                <li>Operation Blowback ("The American media has committed many crimes recently, all of them ignored by everyone except for us. We, the people, will not allow this to continue.")
                                </li>
                                <li>Operation Shutdown ("On March 4th the US government will shutdown and all nonessential government functions will be put on hold. This gives us a chance to show the world that we are a force to be listened to. This will give us a chance to gain leverage. This will give us an undeniable voice in the world. We must attack while they are weak or they will eventually land a crippling blow.")
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                That's in addition to #opemmaa, the plan to recruit female Anons, or #opnewblood, which seeks to explain the often confusing ways of Anonymous to new recruits.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Things have gotten so chaotic that even some members who thrive on chaos have had enough. One proposed the meta-op "<a href="http://anonnews.org/?p=press&amp;a=item&amp;i=657">Operation Operation</a>," in which "the question now is not what Anonymous is or should be. The question now is what Anonymous should do to solve these increasing problems!"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anons are trying to work out various systems for vetting press releases, holding votes on targets, etc, as a way of organizing the chaos a bit, but the moves run counter to the non-hierarchical tendencies of most Anons.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As one Anon put it in yet another <a href="http://anonnews.org/?p=press&amp;a=item&amp;i=671">press release</a>, "We are plasma. We are given unique life through our lack of connection, we have no structure, and through drive and energy of our members we are given life beyond the controlling forces around us. We are the state which cannot be contained."
                            </p>
