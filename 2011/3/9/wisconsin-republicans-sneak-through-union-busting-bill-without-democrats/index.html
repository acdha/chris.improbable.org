Ezra Klein has<a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2011/03/what_happened_in_wisconsin_ton.html">a good explanation of how the Republicans managed to get the vote through without a quorum</a> that the AWOL senate Democrats had been preventing with their absence. Laura Conoway<a href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/03/09/6229962-update-wisconsin-gop-passes-union-stripping-bill">writes</a>:
                            </p>

                                <p>
                                    Republicans are splitting Governor Walker’s bill into two parts. They can vote by themselves, without a budget quorum, on anything that’s not fiscally related. Since the union-busting is not about the budget (as we’ve been saying throughout the standoff), they could vote on that without the Democrats present.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                It was <em>never</em> about the budget.
                            </p>

                                Rick Ungar <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/rickungar/2011/03/09/wisconsin-senate-goes-with-nuclear-option-will-vote-on-collective-bargaining-denial-without-democrats/">sums up</a> the spirit of the vote: “They lied,” he writes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They did lie. Despite saying time and again that the GOP budget was all about righting Wisconsin’s fiscal ship, it turns out this was little more than a ruse. The <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2011/03/09/scott-fitzgerald-obama/">words</a> of senate leader Scott Fitzgerald should be enough to prove that once and for all:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Well if they flip the state senate, which is obviously their goal with eight recalls going on right now, they can take control of the labor unions. If we win this battle, and the money is not there under the auspices of the unions, certainly what you’re going to find is President Obama is going to have a much difficult, much more difficult time getting elected and winning the state of Wisconsin.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                This is what the union-busting bills across the country are about. In <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/rickungar/2011/03/09/union-busting-michigan-style/">Michigan</a>, in <a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2011/02/22/indiana-democrats-walk-out-to-protest-union-busting-bill-deny-quorum/">Indiana</a>, in<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheat-sheet/item/ohio-senate-passes-bill-restricting-collective-bargaining-rights/scabs/">Ohio</a>, in Wisconsin, and elsewhere. They’re about breaking the Democratic party and demoralizing and defunding its base.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile Republicans in <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/03/02/109711/arizona-medicaid-cuts-have-hidden.html">Arizona are trying to cut hundreds of thousands of people from the Medicaid rolls</a>, while Republicans in Florida are enacting sweeping plans to<a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/12/rick-scott-florida-education-jeb-bush">privatize the state’s schools</a> and cut public services.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If this is not an all-out assault on Democrats, then it is most certainly an all-out assault on the Democratic constituency: the poor, unions, minorities, immigrants. The Republican vision for the future of America is simple: tax cuts for the rich, and service cuts for the poor; excellent private schools for the rich, and dubious for-profit private schools for everybody else. Privatize public services by handing them over to wealthy donors, and push that inequality gap even wider.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This chart sums it up nicely:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://blogs-images.forbes.com/erikkain/files/2011/03/cuts.jpg"><img title="cuts" src="http://blogs-images.forbes.com/erikkain/files/2011/03/cuts-430x1024.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="1024"></a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The only cold comfort in all of this is that the Republicans are over-reaching. They have energized the Democratic base more than anything the Democrats could do themselves. Can Democrats keep up the momentum into 2012? Nobody passes up an opportunity like the Democrats after all. Still, I think this time it’s different.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In Wisconsin, momentum is hardly the problem. Progressive activists are already attempting to recall a number of state senate Republicans, and Governor Walker is eligible for recall in 2012. <a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2011/03/09/anti-public-employee-bill-passes-senate-in-wisconsin-only-the-beginning-of-the-fight/">David Dayen summarizes</a>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    • <em>Recalls</em>. This will only energize progressives and labor to get the required signatures for recalls. All 8 Republicans eligible for recall voted to strip public employee unions of their rights, despite <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-09/americans-oppose-republican-attack-on-unions-in-poll-divided-over-benefits.html">clear public opposition</a>. Many of these Republicans, frankly, are going to recall as early as this summer, and if just three of them lose, the balance of power will switch to Democrats in the state Senate. There are also races for three open seats in the state Assembly coming up in May, so even more movement could occur.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    • <em>Scott Walker</em>. If his approval ratings were slipping before, they may fall off a cliff now. Walker cannot be recalled until January 2012, and that’s a long way off. But depending on the momentum from the state Supreme Court election, recall elections, Assembly open seats, and legal fights, there could easily be enough support to recall Walker by then.
                                </p>
