                            <p>
                                Justin Charity has <a href="http://justincharity.com/post/3732879483/teachers-talking-about-fiction-talking-about-fact">a very good post up</a> on the false choices given to us in the current education reform debate. He argues that “we don’t actually&nbsp;<em>have</em> compelling, widely accepted metrics by which we effectively and consistently evaluate teacher performance” – which is true, we don’t, and yet that point is quickly glossed over by reformers when they talk about hiring and firing bad teachers. Here’s Justin again:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Value-added&nbsp;assessments&nbsp;<a title="Michael Winerip: Evaluating New York Teachers, Perhaps the Numbers Do Lie" href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11066/1130314-298.stm">are not gospel</a>, and until ed reform advocates can rally around a rough sketch of adequate metrics, I can’t fathom the point of all this teacher talk&nbsp;<em>at the expense of pretty much any other set of education reform proposals.</em>
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                The two most common critiques I hear of my position on education reform are that A) I’m letting teachers off the hook; and that B) all I want is to go back to the old status quo.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the first critique, I can only say that no I don’t want to let teachers off the hook. Bad teachers really should get fired, and many do. Many do before they get tenure, and many more leave within the first five years of teaching. As Justin notes:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    In a dig at Kain, McArdle notes, “It’s fun to be the guy who proposes universal pre-K or smaller class sizes.” But hey — where’s the heavy lift in suggesting that we should&nbsp;<em>hire good teachers</em> and&nbsp;<em>fire bad ones</em>, especially when you’ve yet to define or suggest, despite much prodding, what adequate teaching looking like?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The false flag in the sustained focus on teachers is thus: citing cases of extreme teacher malfeasance as a broad explanation of how making teachers easier to fire will produce better education outcomes and better-equipped students.&nbsp;There are, of course, countless rubber room anecdotes to bolster the case that there are some teachers <em>who should obviously be fireable and should obviously be fired.</em> Right on — but what about less dramatic, actually contentious examples? What about teachers that a principal or district may want to quantify as inadequate despite not being&nbsp;<a title="NY Post: Rubber room's 'dirty' old man" href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/brooklyn/rubber_room_dirty_old_man_t4OA6Bw25idPYynCnVJHyO">this guy</a>?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Put simply: if you haven’t discerned what makes teachers ideally hirable in the first place, or even what makes teachers basically “good” or “bad” at teaching (aside from obvious qualities, like “not groping children”), then what is the point of launching this conversation in terms of firing teachers?
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                This is exactly right. Anecdotal evidence of really awful teachers is always springing forth to justify a system of accountability designed to weed out ineffective, unsatisfactory teachers. This system is predicated on the belief that testing and test scores are all you really need to hold teachers and schools accountable. But this is simply not the case. Reformers cannot constantly wave this idea around as though they are the only ones who care about teacher quality, and then plug their ears whenever critics point out that tests are a very crude, very imprecise measure of student achievements and teacher quality.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Far from not wanting to hold teachers accountable, critics suggest that a better way would be to make teaching a better, more professional job with higher standards for teachers. Contra reformers who often advocate for doing away with teaching credentials, many critics believe that more credentials and more professional development would lead to better more committed teachers. Paying teachers more for higher levels of achievement and for meeting various goals could also help – merit pay, in other words, based not on clumsy testing but on professional development and skill and peer review.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This leads directly into the second critique: critics like myself simply want the status quo back.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Again, this is simply not true, though it is perhaps a first step. I think the last decade of school reform has taken us in <em>exactly the wrong direction</em>. To go back to the status quo would be, by definition, heading in the right direction. However, that is not where we should stop. Progress can continue from the status quo onward. We can improve upon the status quo, but part of that is first rolling back all these very misguided reform efforts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Critics of contemporary reforms have plenty of ideas – ideas that at one point had wide popular support from policy makers.Some of them are:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                National standards which ensure that students in Mississippi and students in Maine are learning essentially the same thing; a national voluntary curriculum that could help guide teachers and schools toward a more robust educational experience; more support for teachers in the classroom; more collaboration between schools and teachers made more possible by the advances in technology and communication. I could go on and on. Nor do all critics of reform march in lockstep. There is plenty of disagreement beyond the current debate.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Indeed, there are many, many different ways we could improve education in this country that go beyond the twin-solutions of school choice and accountability. As I mentioned previously, making teaching a better profession will attract better people to teaching. This is still an approach aimed at getting good teachers into the system – I just think it’s a more sensible approach than making teaching a <em>worse profession</em> in order to get bad teachers out.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You cannot simply focus on tests and accountability or else students only learn how to take tests. You have to focus on creating a strong <em>system</em> because you simply cannot achieve 100% great teachers no matter what you do. So you give teachers support, incentivize them to grow over the years, turn veteran teachers into mentors for new teachers – especially at poor schools where turnover and burnout are high – and you set up various guides for teachers to follow (national standards, curriculum, etc.) while allowing them as much room for creative pedagogy and as much teaching autonomy as possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some reforms to due process are good – really awful teachers should be fired (and sometimes prosecuted). Making the process of getting rid of really bad teachers more streamlined is a good idea – but often these teachers are not identified because of bad test scores! They are identified for doing something to a student, coming to work drunk, etc. How does testing even factor into this?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In any case, the notion that critics of contemporary reforms simply want to defend all teachers no matter what and stick like glue to the status quo is simply untrue. It is repeated time and again to write critics out of the debate, and maintain the false choices of education reform.
                            </p>
