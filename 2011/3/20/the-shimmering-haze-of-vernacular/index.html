                                I'm finally reading Kate Brown's <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBiography-No-Place-Borderland-Heartland%2Fdp%2F0674019490&amp;tag=languagehat-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">A Biography of No Place</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=languagehat-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important"></i> (which I got for Christmas <a href="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/003352.php">back in 2008</a>), a book succinctly described in the back-cover blurb as follows:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                This is a biography of a borderland between Russia and Poland, a region where, in 1925, people identified as Poles, Germans, Jews, Ukrainians, and Russians lived side by side. Over the next three decades, this mosaic of cultures was modernized and homogenized out of existence by the ruling might of the Soviet Union, then Nazi Germany, and finally, Polish and Ukrainian nationalism. By the 1950s, this "no place" emerged as a Ukrainian heartland, and the fertile mix of peoples that defined the region was destroyed.
                            </blockquote>I've only read the first chapter so far, but it has some passages very relevant to LH concerns, which I will excerpt. The context is the situation described <a href="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/003960.php">here</a>, the development of thousands of little ethno-territorial units in the 1920s; Jan Saulevich, vice secretary of the Ukrainian Commission for National Minority Affairs, is scouting the Ukrainian hinterland in 1925 to try to find a suitable place to establish a Polish autonomous region:
                            <blockquote>
                                Once Saulevich and his inspectors arrived in the villages, they encountered an even greater problem: they could not <i>see</i> nationality. Because of the distances and the difficulty in traveling, the lack of communications, and an incoherent consumer economy, villagers lived in isolated subcultures that eluded standardizing taxonomies. Investigators sent ambiguous reports back to Saulevich: "There is no one picture of the border region. There are many; the picture is diffuse." Or investigators found that people supposedly belonging to different nationalities were indiscernible: "Ukrainians and Poles hardly differ from one another in their material existence beyond their conversational languageâ€”however, language too is problematic because the local Polish sounds very much like the local Ukrainian." Another investigator stated the problem a different way: "The issue of gathering conclusive evidence on the Polish population is hindered by the fact that people, especially the rural population, are bilingual." Language, dress, religion, the social and ethnic composition of the populations, changed from village to village, which made it difficult to fix nationality in place, as the definition of what it meant to be Polish shimmered about in a haze of vernacular. And yet Saulevich and his staff set out to encircle and chart nationality, such as "Polishness," assuming that it existed in some definite, invariable form. Perhaps Saulevich was thinking he would find a peasant version of the secular, aristocratic Polish culture into which he was born on his family's country estate in the northern reaches of the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kresy">kresy</a></i>....
                            </blockquote>Eventually the Marchlevsk Autonomous Polish Region "was founded in the borderlands, a place considered the most backward, poor, and un-revolutionary part of Ukraine," centered on the town now called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dovbysh">Dovbysh</a>:
