                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                There were many years in which I could have written Doug Mataconis’s Friday post, “<a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/you-can-be-compassionate-without-supporting-big-government/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+OTB+%28Outside+The+Beltway+%7C+OTB%29">You Can Be Compassionate Without Supporting Big Government</a>,” and for all I know, I did. I supported the true empathy of unforced charity, worried about government programs “crowding out” civil society, and believed that the “coerced” nature of redistributive policies made it impossible to be “moral” at all, since morality requires affirmative choice. I also bought most of the arguments about how government poor-support policies were counterproductive – doing more harm than good. <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rawreplay/2011/09/tea-party-audience-cheers-letting-the-uninsured-die/">Like Ron Paul</a>, I wouldn’t have wanted the dude to die, but I’d want it to be “<a href="http://www.google.com/search?aq=f&amp;gcx=w&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=the+little+platoons">the little platoons</a>” that saved him.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This leaves me with no standing to get snooty about other people supporting the above. So I’ll just list a few reasons I changed my mind.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                1. The numbers don’t add up. Given the actual costs of catastrophic illness, to take just one calamity that can afflict people, a given church or community association can only support so much of any one person’s affliction, let alone many members.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                2. What the actual historical record seems to show between the early 19th to the mid-20th Century, is the actual provisioners of private charity pushing for more public, tax-funded responses to the problems the provisioners worked on. The little platoons themselves apparently felt they were not up to the task.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On “conservative” Hayekian/Burkean principles, the observed pattern of private charitable providers becoming public-policy reformers should count as evidence from the slow evolution of tradition.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                3. One of the claimed advantages of relying on decentralized, private charity is the leveraging of a kind of Hayekian local knowledge: you are better able to help your family member, your friend, your neighbor than the impersonal government, because you know those people better than any bureaucrat can know them, and can aid them more effectively than any “one size fits all” program designed in some distant capitol.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But having had more years to live with troubled family members and get to know severely disabled friends makes me suspect there’s some value in <em>depersonalization</em>. In the real world, the financial and emotional strains of poverty, disability, addiction, chronic illness and post-calamity trauma overload social relationships. Friendships break. Families splinter. The realities of class stratification and income distribution mean that the Afflicted’s social network is simply unlikely to carry much spare capacity anyway.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                4. There is no political dynamic that gets us from a rickety welfare state to a viable left-libertarian “voluntaryist” minarchism. A left-libertarian, post-state society where neighbor cares for neighbor and we crowd-source help for the needy by leveraging internet technology still appeals to me on a deep emotional level. But no American political movement with the energy and power to eliminate the existing social-welfare system will be animated by the impulses needed to make Voluntaryland work as desired.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The American record is clear: the only anti-welfare-state coalitions that “get things done” are culturally right-wing coalitions. Their animating principle is hostility toward the Other: the nationally, racially, sexually different. This means “limited government” comes bundled in a coalition with nativism, jingoism and sexual inquisition. It relies on a theory of “strong desert” where people are poor because of failures of “personal responsibility.” Eliminating “big government” – meaning, the social programs part of “big government” – in America and keeping it from coming back via the democratic process means this coalition dominates not just all the levers of power but the idea space of the culture. You don’t get robust voluntary support for the indigent and afflicted from that society. Once you establish that “the irresponsible” don’t “deserve” support from the government, it’s unclear why they deserve my personal support either.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                5. As for the supposed counterproductive nature of some or all social-welfare programs, I came to doubt that this was an iron law of social welfare. It might just be that our existing programs were too chintzy to do any good.
