                            <p>
                                From comments downblog, frankly speculative musing that may even count as libertarian “bashing,” finally vindicating Radley Balko’s accusation all these months later. But it might just be excuse-making.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What I’m wondering is whether “libertarian” is an inevitably temporary political outlook. The answer must surely be No, right? I mean, Brian Doherty has a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Radicals-Capitalism-Freewheeling-American-Libertarian/dp/1586485725/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1316963160&amp;sr=8-1">big, thick book</a> of people who lived and died as libertarians of one sort or another! So let’s say that at best I’m speaking in tendencies; I am also talking about “<a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2011/09/25/booing-too-good-for-him/">operational</a>” identities; and otherwise opening myself up to flavors of “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman">No True Scotsman</a>” (No FAKE Scotsman?) critiques.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I also remember an early “blogarama” in Adams-Morgan where I got to meet fellow bloggers and readers, and some folks fussing over me not just because I was a libertarian, but because I was <em>a middle-aged libertarian with kids and everything</em>. Which, I was assured, was a rare breed. The people they knew were mostly libertarians <em>until</em> they became older, and parents, and for whatever reason changed their outlook. I think of Frost and Borges in old age, embracing JFK and the Argentine junta respectively.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So my suggestion is that “libertarians” are like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiddlywinks">tiddlywinks</a> discs that haven’t been flipped yet. Sooner or later, the Great Squidger, Circumstance, presses on you, and you end up in one of the cups over here on the left or over there on the right. At that point you may still be proud of your unique translucency or striking striations, but you have jumped one way or the other. You may formally renounce your libertarianism. You may insist on keeping the label while justifying what amounts to joining the conservative coalition on the grounds that “Economics is primary, and the Republican Party is the lesser of two evils economically,” or explaining away operational liberalism because, “while liberals tend to overreach in regulating the free market, at least they want to keep the Hand of the State away from your nether parts.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For a lot of so-called neo-libertarians, the squidger was the Global War on Terror. In particular, supporting the Iraq War tended to align them with neoconservatives and “Jacksonians” in the GOP coalition, and over time they became “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0871136228/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=unqualifiedof-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0871136228">Republican Party Reptiles</a>” and, eventually, just <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/">reptiles</a>. The Global Financial Crisis and the ensuing Great Recession pushed others leftward. These people decided events had <a href="http://zombiecon.wikidot.com/">falsified the strong version of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis</a>, and demonstrated that Wealth would always be able to make the political system socialize its own risks. In such an environment, gutting such safety nets as exist for the non-wealthy amounted to unilateral disarmament by the bottom 90% of the income distribution.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And maybe you think that second category is me, and maybe I had to delete “us” and “we” from the first version I wrote, because it would have been dishonest. Because I think my real <em>*flip*</em> was the Bush Administration’s social-security privatization proposal in 2005-6, and the enthusiastic advocacy for it by libertarians like my, well, <em>young</em> friend Will Wilkinson. As long as privatized social security was abstract, I was all for it. But when it became, seemingly, a real possibility, I looked at the law, and I looked at the Henley-family finances, and I knew fear. Real “maybe I won’t sleep; maybe I’ll just stare at the ceiling all night” terror. Somewhere in there, I recovered enough other-directedness to recall that we are very far from the worst-off household I know. And I realized that my stated beliefs were a sham. A luxury. I leapt, at least in my secret heart, into one of the available cups.
