                            <p>
                                Since the 1980s, the US government's Chicago-area <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/">Fermilab</a> has been at the forefront of high-energy physics. That's in large part thanks to the Tevatron, the machine that first reached the energies needed to discover the last quark in the Standard Model. But the Tevatron has come to the end of its run; at 2pm on Friday, it will be shut down for the last time (an event that <a href="http://www-visualmedia.fnal.gov/live/110930Tev.htm">will be webcast</a>).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The move will shift physicists' focus across the Atlantic, to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The LHC is likely to enjoy a long run at the top of particle physics, but in time, it too will be superseded. What might come next? If Fermilab scientists have their way, particle physics could migrate from hadrons to muons. But getting there will take time, research, and the serious application of time-dilating relativity.

                                A series of bad options
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The cancellation of the American <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/09/super-collider-gallery/">Superconducting Supercollider</a> (SSC) in the 1990s gave particle physics a hangover. It took years for the next big accelerator (the LHC) to be built, and even when it operates at its designed power, it won't reach the energies once planned for the SSC. The LHC is also a fundamentally different project, constructed in tunnels built for an earlier collider and requiring financial input from just about every country with a significant physics program. These harsh realities leave just about everyone who thinks about it wondering whether anything more powerful than the LHC will ever get built. It has also forced them to ponder exotic ways to get particles up to high energies using approaches that are fundamentally different from anything we've tried before.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During Ars' <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/05/ars-visits-the-tevatron-particle-accelerator-at-fermilab.ars">visit to Fermilab earlier this year</a>, however, we found out that at least some researchers have pondered using the traditional approach to accelerating particles—but relying on exotic particles to produce energies that rival those of the LHC in a much smaller space. The muon is a heavier, less stable version of the electron, and it's produced in many of the collisions that occur in particle colliders like the LHC and Tevatron. With a half life of just a few microseconds, it wouldn't seem to be an obvious candidate for accelerating. But, thanks to some of the consequences of relativity, it might just fit the bill.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Particle colliders all work on the same general principle. When two particles smash together at nearly the speed of light, some of the energy they carry gets converted into mass, as per Einstein's E = mc<sup>2</sup>. But, as Fermilab director Pier Oddone noted, accelerators like the LHC and the Tevatron aren't as efficient as they otherwise might be. That's because they both collide hadrons (as the LHC's name implies), which are composites of three quarks. Thus, even when a pair of protons collide head on, only part of their total energy gets imparted to the quarks that actually do the colliding.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "The energy of hadron collisions is split among its components," Oddone told Ars. "Lepton [a fundamental particle] collisions give us <em>all</em> the energy—they're about 10 times better."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At the same energy, collisions between fundamental particles—those that aren't comprised of smaller constituents—pump much more of their energy into the creation of exotic matter. As Oddone put it, a 1TeV collider that smashed leptons would be about as powerful as the LHC, which operates at much higher energies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, few fundamental particles make for good colliding. Quarks and gluons are unstable unless they're bound together as parts of other particles; neutrinos are too light and don't carry a charge; everything else is unstable except the electron (which is a kind of lepton). Electron colliders have been built at places like the Stanford Linear Accelerator and at CERN, where the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) Collider used to occupy the tunnels that now house the LHC. But colliders that smash electrons and/or positrons are extremely difficult to build.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The problem arises from the electron's low mass. As any charged particle is made to travel along a curved path, it loses some of its energy as radiation (called synchrotron radiation; this has turned out to be a useful source of high energy photons, which is why many older accelerators have been put back into service for imaging purposes). For a particle as light as the electron, this loss is enough to remove much of the energy put into accelerating it in the first place. Thus, without continual boosts, the particles swinging around the circular track of the LEP would quickly slow to speeds useless to physicists.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The solution? Simply run the particles along a straight path. This comes with its own problems, though—the higher the energy, the longer the necessary path and the more expensive the buildout. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So building a high energy lepton collider is a choice between two unappealing options: building a ring that would require a lot of energy to run, or building a linear collider that requires a lot of space and money. The alternative, another proton collider that's bigger than the LHC, doesn't look like it's in the cards any time soon.

                                Why not muons?
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                That list of unappealing options has many people at Fermilab starting to look seriously at muon colliders. The muon has a lot of things going for it. It's also a charged lepton, like the electron, and so it behaves a bit like an electron's heavier brother—a much heavier brother. With a mass of just over 100MeV (Mega-electron Volts), the muon is about 200 times heavier than the electron—in fact, it's over 10 percent of the mass of a proton. It should therefore behave more like a proton when it comes to acceleration and maintaining speed at high energies, while still having the advantage of being a fundamental particle.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There's just one small problem: muons aren't stable. They're relatively long-lived when it comes to exotic fundamental particles, but they typically survive only a couple of microseconds before decaying into a spray of other particles, including an electron. Microseconds don't seem like a lot to work with here... but there may be a way to make muons survive long enough to be useful. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Muons are typically produced as a result of high-energy collisions that also impart a reasonable amount of energy to the particles. Thus, the muons will typically start off moving pretty quickly. And, once a bit of further acceleration happens, some interesting effects of relativity kick in.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As particles approach the speed of light, two things happen. Since additional energy won't cause them to speed up much further, most of the energy gets converted into mass (again, to balance the books using Einstein's famous E = mc<sup>2</sup>). As a result, the muons will start off heavy and get even heavier as they're accelerated. This makes them easier to corral into useful bunches. Since the muons' negative charges push against their mass, the impact of charge repulsion drops quickly as the mass goes up. Muons that start off moving quickly and are rapidly accelerated will be easier to package into the dense bunches that lead to a high rate of collisions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even more significantly, strange things start happening to time as the muons approach the speed of light. In the muons' frame of reference, time slows down relative to the frame of the accelerator hardware and the humans operating it. As a result of the speed, their short two microsecond lifetime begins to stretch out.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At 10GeV of energy, Oddone said, the muons survive nearly 100 times longer than one of their stationary peers would. He thinks it might be possible to get them as high as five TeV, which would provide a very large lifetime boost. The end result is that the hardware would have a lot more time to get the muons up to speed and smash them together before they'd typically decay on their own.

                                Will it actually work?

                            <p>
                                Researchers at Fermilab are already performing initial studies to explore the idea's feasibility. One thing is already clear: the muon accelerator wouldn't operate much like anything we know now. Machines like the Tevatron and the LHC have long chains of accelerators that gradually ramp particles up to higher energies before passing them to the next piece of hardware. At the Tevatron, there's an extended process of ramping particles up to the accelerator's maximum energy (at the LHC, the ramp-up alone takes about half an hour), squeezing them into denser bunches, and then scraping off any particles that are outside the main bunch.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With muons, any ramp in energy will have to occur nearly instantaneously, which creates its own problems. With the current radiofrequency-based acceleration, Oddone told Ars that we can only add about 150MeV per meter to each particle. That would mean a significant distance before the particles get up to speed, and, more significantly, the process might not occur quickly enough to extend the muons' lifetimes into something reasonable. Fermi might first need to develop a plasma-based technology, sometimes referred to as <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/09/big-lasers-make-electrons-bunch-together-in-tiny-bunches.ars">laser wakefield acceleration</a>. Then it might be possible to add up to 10GeV per meter—but right now, the technology is still under development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "It's tough to control," Oddone said, "although some progress has been made in making a beam lately."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If the technical hurdles can be overcome, Oddone thinks it will be possible to get muons up to 5TeV within the existing Fermi footprint.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Still, other challenges remain. Since protons are stable, machines like the Tevatron and LHC can keep the particles circulating for hours, producing a steady stream of collisions. When enough particles are lost to annihilations, the rest are simply dumped; the accelerator is refilled over the next several hours. The Tevatron's runs, for example, typically last 16 hours, and no amount of time dilation is going to make a muon last that long.

                                For muons, the accelerator will have to perform this sort of cycling within a matter of seconds—Fermi estimates that the muons would only survive for 1,000 trips around the final collider ring once. In effect, even though acceleration will be a discontinuous process, the accelerator will have to be able to perform it thousands of times a day.

                                Fermi's initial plan proposes a fairly traditional particle factory, where protons will be accelerated and then fired at a static target. The spray of particles that results will be captured and focused as the less stable particles start to decay. The resulting particles will be split into bunches and sent into a series of coolers that squeeze each bunch down, increasing the density of muons and reducing the diameter of each bunch (these are called "coolers" because they reduce the energy involved in motion across the beam). Once bunched and chilled, the muons will be run through a linear pre-accelerator and transferred to a couple of rings (the largest being 4km across) before being handed off to a collider.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Each of these steps will have to act more like a continuous feed than the discrete accelerators that we currently use. It will be a radically different beast than anything we've built in the past.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is especially true of the linear accelerator (linac) that first accelerates protons for muon production. Although I referred to it as "fairly traditional," it will differ in one key way: it will need to fire off and accelerate bunches of protons at a much higher rate than anything we're currently using. Right now, linac hardware needs to reset in between bursts of activity, dissipating the charges that build up each time an acceleration is performed. To create muons in sufficient quantities, the linac will have to operate nearly continuously.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That's not necessarily an easy thing to do. Steve Holmes, who has served as the Deputy Chair of Fermi's Long Range Planning Committee, told me that the big hope is a new technology: a superconducting radiofrequency accelerator.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although Holmes said the technology is "not as mature," it would get rid of the heat and power issues. Currently, there's already one superconducting radiofrequency accelerator in use at the Oak Ridge National Lab, where it helps power their neutron source. If it works out for Fermi, the linac could power much more than the muon accelerator.

                            <p>
                                The muon collider, if it ever gets built, will be part of a set of projects at what the people at Fermi term the "intensity frontier."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The use of the term "intensity" deserves a bit more explanation. The LHC, for example, pushes the number of collisions in a single run to very high levels; it's why the collider will surpass the total collisions observed during the Tevatron's entire history within just a few years. But that luminosity—the frequency of collisions—creates its own problems. Hardware and software has a harder time separating out what happened when multiple events occur in rapid succession.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What Fermi hopes to do with its new accelerator project is somewhat different, focusing on what its scientists are terming "intensity" (rather than luminosity). Its proposed Project X will create a huge number of events, but specialized detectors will only pick up those rare events that provide information on a specific process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Luminosity complications are not a problem for rare physics," Holmes told Ars, while explaining that the intensity happens at the generation step, not with the detectors.

                                What constitutes a rare event? Holmes pointed to pion decays, which typically produce a muon and a neutrino—where "typically" means 99.9988 percent of the time. That means if something funny is going on with any of the rare decay pathways, we'll need to produce a lot of pions to see it. That's exactly how the new Fermi Project X effort is supposed to work: produce lots of a given particle in order to look for rare events or make difficult measurements.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In most cases, the targets of these specialized detectors will be cases where some preliminary results have suggested something is going on that isn't entirely compatible with the Standard Model. In one example, initial measurements of the muon's magnetic moment have suggested it has a value that's over three standard deviations off from the one that Standard Model calculations would suggest. By producing and measuring enough muons, we can provide a measurement with an error that's small enough to give us confidence that the Standard Model is wrong (or right).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Similar things are possible with Kaons, where there are several rare decay pathways that only occur once in 10<sup>11</sup>-10<sup>14</sup> events. One of these is so rare that Holmes said it has only been observed six times. Project X might produce a thousand of these events.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The proton beam from the new linac could also be directed into the neutrino experiments that are already ongoing at Fermi (which currently shoots a beam of neutrinos to a detector in Minnesota). These experiments look at the details of the flavor oscillations that particles undergo, oscillations in which (for example) a muon neutrino can be detected as an electron neutrino. Project X would produce enough muons to determine if something similar takes place in these charged leptons, where a muon might end up oscillating into an electron. This has never been observed, but it is theoretically possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Several such experiments are in the planning stages. They aren't the sort of grand hunts for unknown particles and forces that we've come to associate with particle accelerators, but they may be effective at telling us where theoretical results don't match up well with the real world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If everything goes well, some percentage of those protons will be fired at a target to produce muons, which will then be fed into one of the most powerful particle accelerators on the planet. But there's plenty of work to do first.
