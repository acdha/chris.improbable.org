                            <p>
                                <a rel="attachment wp-att-2671" href="http://www.neurdon.com/2011/08/25/ibm-cognizer-really/cognizer/"><img title="cognizer" src="http://www.neurdon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cognizer-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"></a>One of the main goals of Neurdon, since its very beginnings, was to educate readers to tell apart fiction from reality. Nowadays, big companies are diving (or dive-bombing) in the field of neural computing with hyperbolic claims of being able to simulate biological brains, from feline to humans. One of such a claim comes, again, from IBM. This is the truth behind what IBM calls "cognitive computer".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The story, which has echoed across media outlets from <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/innovation/08/18/ibm.brain.chip/index.html?hpt=hp_c2">CNN</a> to <a href="http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4218883/IBM-demos-cognitive-computer-chips">EETimes</a>, goes something like this: "IBM on Thursday announced it has created a chip designed to imitate the human brain's ability to understand its surroundings, act on things that happen around it and make sense of complex data. [....] One of the prototype cores contains what amounts to 262,144 programmable synapses, and the other contains 65,536 learning synapses." The chip has 256 neurons.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let's check with a bit more care what the claim is in the two main domains, the hardware and the task. At the end of the day, what we want to know is what we can do with the chip, so the main dimensions we need to consider are power (both computing power, and power consumption), and what I can achieve with it (namely, do I do better than what has been already done?).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>The hardware:</strong> Neurdon readers are educated ones, and should not be caught by surprise. You can just read the <a href="http://www.neurdon.com/2010/08/12/neuromorphic-systems-silicon-neurons-and-neural-arrays-for-emulating-the-nervous-system/">very instructive post</a> by Fope, published last August, that provides some good background info on the topic. Brain chips of the kind that IBM has built are neither new, not for sale at Best Buy. The reason? Well, the main one is behind your screen right now: digital chips of the kind that equip your laptop or tablet PC are just so efficient and flexible that the "neuromorphic alternative" is not viable yet. As I was saying, this sort of chips are not new. Starting with the pioneering work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carver_Mead">Carver Mead</a>, "spiking" chips that mimic some of the functional characteristics of biological neurons (namely, the nonlinear, low-voltage dynamics of their membrane potential) have been explored for decades, and there are numerous groups leading the change on this framework. For instance, the Johns Hopkins <a href="http://www.neurdon.com/2010/08/12/neuromorphic-systems-silicon-neurons-and-neural-arrays-for-emulating-the-nervous-system/">IFAT</a> chip is one of such examples: the 4th generation system (IFAT 4G) will consist of over 60,000 neurons (10 chips) with 120 million fully programmable synaptic connections. Another example comes from Stanford, with the <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/neurogrid.html">Neurogrid</a> featuring sixteen Neurocores, each with 256x256 silicon neurons in 11.9x13.9 sq-mm. Not to forget a major player in Europe, the <a href="http://www.neurdon.com/2010/03/27/the-facets-project/">FACETS</a> chip (now continuing in the <a href="http://brainscales.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/">BrainScales</a> initiative) consisting of 200,000 neurons and 50 million synapses. So?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well, all these initiatives are from academic institutions that do not have the PR firing power of IBM. Neurdons are warned though: this has already been done, at larger scales.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But there is more. The chip designed by IBM, and many (but not all) of the chips that depart from a purely digital approach in calculating action potentials and synaptic changes do have an advantage over power and size over purely digital approaches, but are severely lacking in one major feature that is essential in both research and engineering applications: flexibility. The learning rule implemented in the IBM chip, which is the major learning rule employed in the SyNAPSE project (spike-timing dependent plasticity, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike-timing-dependent_plasticity">STDP</a>), is one of the many synaptic plasticity rule used by neurons to give brains their amazing, most important characteristic: the ability to learn. The debate over whether STDP is even a "real" rule is still open (<a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/synaptic_neuroscience/10.3389/fnsyn.2010.00140/abstract">see for instance here</a>). Bad news: when you implement STDP as the only synaptic rule, you are bound to exist in the subset of models that use it. Which is limited, and surely not enough to implement a human or cat brain... even aplysias are more complex that that. Again, now Neurdons know...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But wait! There is more. Despite this post won't go into details on power-size and other more subtle comparison of the IBM chip and what's out there (and soon to come) in the purely digital domain, we believe that the winning hardware platform that will enable the next, real weave in brain inspired computing is going to leverage the ongoing multicore revolution, coupled with the introduction of a memory technology that will reduce communication overhead/power losses by bringing memory closer to computation (<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/artificial-intelligence/moneta-a-mind-made-from-memristors">see this article for more info</a>). The beauty of this prediction is that... it's not a prediction! It is a mere observation of a trend which is under our eye. An upcoming post will discuss more about this topic. A preview: check out this chip by <a href="http://www.adapteva.com/">Adapteva</a>, and guess why it is so great.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>The task:</strong> According to the news stories, the chip "has demonstrated the ability to play (and win) against a human in the game "Pong" and can also read a written letter 7, even when written in various ways." Not much to say on Pong: a <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=neural+network+pong&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart">Google scholar search</a> gives 3,430 hits when searching for "neural network PONG".<br>
                                How about recognizing the number 7? Since you are on Google scholar, search for "<a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=neural+networks+MNIST&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=1">neural networks MNIST</a>" (4,170 hits). The field of character recognition is at a stage in which handwritten characters (all of them, not only 7...) can be recognized with almost 100% accuracy by specialized applications, taking into account the presence of size and translation variations, etc. Not very impressive either.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What is this hype about? Well, apparently IBM wants to badly associate their name with some keywords: brain, cognitive, chips. It surely does look like their PR machine does a good job, but Neurdons' antibodies help to tell fiction apart from reality.
