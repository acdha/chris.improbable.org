                                <a href="http://geekfeminism.org/2011/09/03/in-memory-of-nina-reiser/nina/" rel="attachment wp-att-3221"><img title="nina" src="http://geekfeminism.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nina.jpeg" alt="" width="272" height="185"></a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Trigger warning for lethal violence against women</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I picked up Stephen Elliott’s <em><a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9781555975388-6">The Adderall Diaries</a></em> with trepidation, because it’s at least nominally about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Reiser">Hans Reiser murder trial,</a> and Nina Reiser’s murder fucked me up. Her kids are the same age as mine. Her career counselor is my next door neighbor and friend. And her husband and mine are both Linux kernel programmers. They worked together at a Palo Alto startup during the boom, where Hans sometimes cornered my husband to rant about the extremely acrimonious Reiser divorce.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When news of Nina’s disappearance broke, I asked my husband:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Do you think he killed her?”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He thought about it for a minute and said:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “I am not saying no.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Trust me, this is not a thing you ever want to hear.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Elliott’s book is gorgeously written and as a San Francisco memoir has a great deal to recommend it; and it’s not really about Nina and Hans. The trial is more or less just a backdrop to Elliott’s wandering around the Mission District and Bernal Heights and taking too many drugs. I loved it, and I do not mean to suggest that Elliott should have written a different book, or no book at all – here I am writing about Nina to exorcise my own personal bullshit, after all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have two – not even criticisms, let’s say two observations to make about the book. The first is that I am sad, still sad, continually endlessly sad and angry at the way everyone else’s narratives collude to obscure Nina and her life. It’s not that she was a saint or a celebrity – the hagiographies that dwell on her “movie star good looks” set my teeth on edge – but she was an extremely intelligent and tough woman, coping admirably in a horrible situation, and by every account a wonderful, playful, caring and responsible mom.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And because she was murdered she is now, in some sense, public property. Everyone, myself included, projects his or her own personal issues all over her frozen image. Hans’s supporters call her a whore. Stephen Elliott remakes her in the image of his dead mother. Her death has become a set of Meanings that overwhelm her life, which had its own meaning, and which was her own. I mourn the Nina who was alive, and really nice and clever and ordinary. It’s not fair. It’s really shitty that she’s dead, and I hate it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My second point is a little bit harder to make, but here goes. Elliott, God love him, has the creative professional’s lofty disdain for those of us who work in cubes. A brief stint as a search engine optimization specialist at the end of the boom has qualified him to rule on the working world once for all time, apparently. We are not an interesting set of stories, he concludes. We are too simplistic, and the world we inhabit is too black and white.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I actually find this endearing (I have a whole other rant about how people who don’t work in an office can’t write about working for a living and can’t begin to imagine how intricate and interesting it really is, a multi-dimensional 15-puzzle played with and by chimpanzees), but I think it misses part of what was going on with Hans, and maybe a big part. It misses Namesys.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-07/ff_hansreiser">Joshua Davis’s brilliant article in Wired</a> (part of the inspiration for Elliott’s book) joined the dots between Hans’ code and his character, but a company is also an expression of a person’s soul. His brilliant Russian mail-order bride was a big part of Hans’s self-image as the startup entrepreneur who could afford to date, let’s face it, way out of his league. And much of the savagery of the divorce seemed to stem from Hans’s fears that Nina would imperil or claim for herself some part of his hoped-for payout from Namesys.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Hans felt that his intelligence gave him special privileges. (Did I mention that he and my husband worked together at Rearden Steel? Yes, named for the company in Ayn Rand’s novel <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>. You can’t make this shit up.) Armed with his titanium sense of entitlement, Hans insisted on what he saw as his rights. And it seems that when Nina stood up for herself, he choked her to death in the driveway of his mother’s home while their children were playing in the basement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He probably didn’t intend to kill her. My husband makes the macabre point that if the murder were premeditated, Hans would have been better prepared for it. Having done it, though, Hans thought he ought to get away with it. He thought he could outsmart the police. He thought that his intellect was so great that it was only reasonable that he should get away with murder.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Hard to think of a more graphic illustration of the way Silicon Valley-style technocratic capitalism can reinforce the kyriarchy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But here I go again, indulging the temptation to make Nina’s death a metaphor, a political point, an argument, instead of what it is, which is a tragedy. Today, on the fifth anniversary of her murder, I remember Nina.
                            </p>
