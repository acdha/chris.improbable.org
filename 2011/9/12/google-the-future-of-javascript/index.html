                                There’s very little public information yet about Dart (nee, Dash), and as I’m not on Lars’ team I can’t comment about it. More details will be forthcoming at the <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2011/presentation/Opening%20Keynote:%20Dart,%20a%20new%20programming%20language%20for%20structured%20web%20programming">GOTO session next month</a>. I’ll also be at GOTO, <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2011/presentation/Send%20Less,%20Do%20More,%20Go%20Faster:%20The%20Future%20of%20Front%20End%20Development">speaking on JavaScript and the state of the web platform</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Making the rounds is an accidentally leaked early draft of notes from a meeting last year that discusses both Dart and JavaScript. I work on many web platform-related things at Google, including serving as a representative to TC39, the body that standardizes the JavaScript language. I wasn’t at the meetings having previously committed to <a href="http://2010.full-frontal.org/">presenting at FFJS</a>, but my views were represented by others and my name is on the document. As I said, though, it was a draft and doesn’t reflect either the reality of what has happened in the meantime or even the decisions that were taken as a result. And it certainly doesn’t reflect my personal views.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So what’s the deal with Google and JavaScript?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Simply stated, Google is absolutely committed to making JavaScript better, and we’re pushing hard to make it happen.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Erik Arvidsson, Mark Miller, Waldemar Horwat, Andreas Rossberg, Nebojša Ćirić, Mark Davis, Jungshik Shin and I attend TC39 meetings, work on implementations, and try to push JS forward in good faith. And boy, does it need a push.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Erik and I have specifically been working to focus the TC39 agenda away from syntax-free, semantics-only APIs (Object.defineProperty, anyone?) which might be good for tools, compilers, and frameworks but which are hard for day-to-day use.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Through <a href="http://code.google.com/p/traceur-compiler/">Traceur</a> and other efforts we’ve been socializing the idea that the one thing the committee can exclusively do — and should do more of — is to carve out syntax for commonly exercised semantics. Seemingly small things like the <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:classes"><code>class</code> keyword as sugar</a> for the constructor function pattern, or a <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:arrow_function_syntax&amp;s=short+function">shorter syntax for functions</a> are big improvements, if only because it’s TC39 that’s making them. Syntax can end battles over common patterns and help you say what you mean, and JS is overdue for some of this. Larger but more subtle things, like agreement to use pragmas as a way to enable the process of progress in a compatible web, are even more exciting to me. Even proposals that haven’t made it through like <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:scoped_object_extensions">Scoped Object Extensions</a> and <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:deferred_functions">deferred functions</a> have been fought for by us because we desperately want JavaScript to get better. We’re big fans of much of the work coming out of Mozilla for the same reason — in particular Dave Hermann’s excellent <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:modules">modules proposal</a>. Together, these are going to do much to help give modern JS some “backbone” in the near term. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished in TC39 over the last year, and while I hoped for more, the result is an ES.next that looks like it’ll embody many of the things I feel are currently missing. The day-to-day practice of writing JS is going to change dramatically for the better when ES.next arrives.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But it’s not the end — not by a long shot. Classes will give us a humane, interoperable inheritance syntax, but it leaves composition unaddressed by syntax. I’m hopeful that we bless traits in future versions, removing the use of inheritance in most cases. Similarly, I think we can find a way to repair “this” binding foot-guns with softly-bound “this”. Repairing the shared-prototypes issue, either through DOM or through something like Scoped Object Extensions, can and should be done. And once we have all of this, the stage will be set for a flexible, advanced type system that does not need to be all-or nothing and does not need to be hobbled by the ghost of C++/Java’s inflexible nominal-only types. That’s the dream, and we’re not shying away from it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s hard to square this sort of wild enthusiasm for “raw” JavaScript with what’s in the leaked memo, and I can only beg for some amount of understanding. As committed and enthusiastic as I am about the prospects for JavaScript, others are just as enthused about Dart. Google is big, can do many things at once, and often isn’t of one mind. What we do agree on is that we’re trying to make things better the best we know how. Anyone who watches Google long enough should anticipate that we often have different ideas about what that means. For my part, then, consider me and my team to be committed JS partisans for as long as we think we can make a difference.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There are risks, of course. TC39 is long on seasoned language design skill and short on webdev experience, meaning that many things that Erik and I may take for granted as pressing problems need to be explained, sometimes to an incredulous audience. The flip side risk is that naïve solutions may have better alternatives that seasoned language hands can quickly spot and that simple answers have non-obvious risks or preclude movement in other important areas later. It’s good, then, that the committee is working well and is taking appeals to developer productivity seriously.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whatever you might think about programming languages for the browser, let me assure you of one thing: your problem isn’t the language. Not really, anyway. We’ve made good progress in the last year repairing some of the seams between JS and DOM, and Cameron McCormack has helped us drive a new version of WebIDL that correctly explains DOM as a reasonable prototype chain. But it’s only the beginning. The DOM is in terrible shape, and not due to implementation differences. The malign neglect of IDL-addled designs, the ghosts of dead-end XML experiments, and endless cruft will plague any language that sidles up to it. Until we get a real <a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Component_Model">Component Model</a>, a better CSS OM, and some sort of a pragma for DOM that allows us to fix DOM’s abhorrent JS bindings, we’ll continue to be hostage to C++ APIs inartfully wired up to an incredibly dynamic language. And that’s to say nothing of the pressing need for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/experimental-css/">better CSS</a>, animations, and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mdv/">a built-in data-binding/templating system</a>. When the platform doesn’t provide it, today, we get it from JavaScript. But that’s not where the solutions always belong.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let me put it another way: when you find yourself thinking “man, JavaScript sucks,” remember that it’s only painful in large quantities. And why do you need so much of it? ‘Cause the DOM, CSS, and HTML standards are letting you down. Any language wired up to the browser today is subject to the same fate, and the insane reality that these things are specified under different roofs in processes that aren’t subject to the popular will of web developers. Python doesn’t have it’s DOM APIs decided by the W3C, they borrow the idiomatic <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html">ElementTree API</a> from within their own community. WebIDL is an artifact of a different time that has a tenuous relationship to idiomatic JavaScript, the CSS-OM barely exists, and DOM apologists are doing more harm than any of JavaScript’s warts ever have. We can fix these things, of course, and here at Google we’re trying – in good faith – to work in standards to make them better. But the bottom line is that the language isn’t the problem. I repeat: the language isn’t the problem, the platform is.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The only thing that’s going to replace the web as universal platform is the next version of the web. Those of us working on Chrome believe that to the core and feel a deep urge to make things better faster. We might not always agree on the “how,” but we all believe that we can’t do it alone.
                            </p>
