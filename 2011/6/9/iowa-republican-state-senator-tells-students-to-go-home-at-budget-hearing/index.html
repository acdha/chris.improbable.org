                                This doesn’t strike me as <a href="http://iowastatedaily.com/news/article_76e37aca-9219-11e0-952e-001cc4c03286.html">a very good way to maintain a healthy political discourse</a>:

                                    A group of students from all three regents universities visited the state Capitol on Monday to speak about potential budget cuts. However, they were told by Sen. Shawn Hammerlinck (R-Dixon) to "go home."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "It was nice that somebody asked us to come to talk about what a seven percent cut, a $41 million cut, how that would affect the students of those universities," said Jared Knight, vice president of the Government of the Student Body. "We were happy that somebody asked us to talk about that."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After the student representatives were finished, Hammerlinck gave a response. Hammerlinck told students to "go home" and that they were being used as props in the Democratic propaganda effort to increase state spending.
                                </p>

                                Republicans could have brought in students who agreed with their opinions, or responded by explaining why the cuts being proposed were necessary. Perhaps a conversation about alternatives to cuts, or about which cuts made the most sense could have have been sparked.
                            </p>

                                Telling students at a hearing to “go home” because you disagree with what they have to say is just bad form.
