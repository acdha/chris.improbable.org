                                    <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/shortages-of-key-drugs-endanger-patients/2011/04/26/AF1aJJVF_print.html">WP</a>: Doctors, hospitals and federal regulators are struggling to cope with an unprecedented surge in drug shortages in the United States that is endangering cancer patients, heart attack victims, accident survivors and a host of other ill people.

                                Currently there are about <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/DrugShortages/ucm050792.htm">246 drugs</a> that are in short supply, a record high. These shortages are not just a result of accident, error or unusual circumstance, the number of drugs in short supply has risen steadily since 2006. The shortages arise from a combination of systematic factors, among them the <a href="http://www.fdareview.org/incentives.shtml">policies of the FDA</a>. The FDA has inadvertently caused drugs long-used in the United States to be withdrawn from the market and its “Good Manufacturing Practice” rules have gummed up the drug production process and raised costs.

                                Here, for example, is an analysis from the <a href="http://www.ashp.org/drugshortages/summitreport">summary report</a> on drug shortages by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP), the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP).

                                    Several drug shortages (e.g., concentrated morphine sulfate solution, levothyroxine injection) have been precipitated by actual or anticipated action by the FDA as part of the Unapproved Drugs Initiative, which is designed to increase enforcement against drugs that lack FDA approval to be marketed in the United States. (These drugs are commonly called pre-1938 drugs, referring to their availability prior to passage of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of that year.) Some participants noted that the cost and complexity of completing a New Drug Application (NDA) for those unapproved drugs is a disincentive for entering or maintaining a market presence. Other regulatory barriers include the time for FDA review of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) and supplemental applications, which are required for changes to FDA-approved drug products (e.g., change in source for active pharmaceutical ingredients API, change in manufacturer). Manufacturers described this approval process as lengthy and unpredictable, which limits their ability to develop reliable production schedules.

                                and on GMP:

                                    Manufacturing-related causes that contribute to drug shortages are multifactorial. Inability to fully comply with GMP, which results in production stoppages or recalls, was considered a major cause.

                                John Goodman at the <a href="http://www.healthaffairs.org/blog/">Health Affairs Blog</a> explains the <a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2011/06/08/rx-drug-shortages-regulation-can-be-deadly/">details</a>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>

                                    The Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been stepping up its quality enforcement efforts — levying fines and forcing manufacturers to retool their facilities both here and abroad. Not only has this more rigorous regulatory oversight slowed down production, the FDA’s “zero tolerance” regime is forcing manufacturers to abide by rules that are rigid, inflexible and unforgiving. For example, a drug manufacturer must get approval for how much of a drug it plans to produce, as well as the timeframe. If a shortage develops (because, say, the FDA shuts down a competitor’s plant), a drug manufacturer cannot increase its output of that drug without another round of approvals. Nor can it alter its timetable production (producing a shortage drug earlier than planned) without FDA approval.
                                </p>

                                Thus, it’s not any one thing that is causing the shortages but an accumulation of rules and regulations. The system plods along when all is normal, but when a novel situation develops the market can no longer adapt quickly and efficiently.  As <a href="http://innovationandgrowth.wordpress.com/2010/12/04/pebbles-in-the-stream-does-the-fda-slow-medical-technology-innovation/">Michael Mandel puts it</a>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    No single regulation or regulatory activity is going to deter innovation by itself, just like no single pebble is going to affect a stream. But if you throw in enough small pebbles, you can dam up the stream. Similarly, add enough rules, regulations, and requirements, and suddenly innovation begins to look a lot less attractive.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Add to all these pebbles the fact that various <a href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2011/06/08/rx-drug-shortages-regulation-can-be-deadly/">price controls</a> have become more binding over time and thus have reduced the profits from being in the business at all and you have a recipe for deadly shortages.
