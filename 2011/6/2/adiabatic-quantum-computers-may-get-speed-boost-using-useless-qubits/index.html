                            <p>
                                Way back in... 2007, I <a href="http://arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2007/02/quantum.ars">co-authored</a>&nbsp;an Ars report on a commercial quantum computer. In a series of articles, we revealed ourselves to be very skeptical of the&nbsp;<em>D-Wave</em>&nbsp;product and motivations. In the intervening years, I have had a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/02/quantum-optimizer-a-quantum-step-in-the-right-direction.ars">change of heart</a>. What has changed my mind? Simply put, the scientists at <em>D-wave</em> have been producing a series of solid and interesting papers. Each of these papers has answered specific criticisms of the original idea.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, when <em>D-Wave System's</em> Neil Dickson sent me a copy of a paper he had placed in the arXiv that <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2349v1">purported</a> to solve the energy crossing problem, I was excited. I was also busy, so I'm a bit late reporting on this.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Adiabatic quantum computing—<em>D-Wave</em> now refers to this as adiabatic quantum optimization, which is more accurate, but I am retaining the old term to keep the link between various articles clear—uses a sort of annealing approach to solving computing problems. The basic idea is that many problems can be expressed as&nbsp;an&nbsp;energy landscape, and the solution to the problem is the lowest point in that landscape.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So far, so good. But on the face of it, this simply exchanges one problem for another: how do we figure out the lowest energy state of our system. It turns out that this problem is as difficult as the original problem, so we have to employ a trick.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Adiabatic quantum computing
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Instead of starting with the energy landscape of the original problem, we start with something much simpler, calculate the lowest energy state, and put the system in that state. Now, we start to gently prod and poke the energy landscape back into the shape that represented the original problem. If all has gone well, the system stayed in its lowest energy state throughout this process. So, if we now read the state of the system, we have the solution to the problem we wanted to solve.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If that sounds pretty cool to you, you are not alone. But it's not without its critics—one of the most persistent claims has been that level crossings will doom the approach. Essentially, the idea is that as we prod and poke the landscape, we inadvertently trap the system in a local minimum, rather than a global minimum. The result in that case is garbage. To avoid this problem, critics argue, you have to change the energy landscape so slowly that, ultimately, adiabatic quantum computing is no faster than any other form of quantum computing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many researchers have presented examples of how these level crossings occur and, on each occasion, other researchers have shown how to rewrite the problem to avoid level crossings. But that has always left the issue of figuring out how to rewrite the problem—something that is a very time-consuming job. Clearly, what was needed was a technique that could be generally applied to problems, no matter how they were written.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is exactly what the work of Dickson presents. In fact, the answer is pretty simple, but it comes from a deep understanding of how and when level crossing occur and when they are avoided. It also comes at a cost, as we will see.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Avoiding the crossing problem
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                If we have a large number of quantum objects that are coupled together so that they effect each other, then it's quite likely that many different configurations will have the same energy. This is called degeneracy, and in D-Wave's&nbsp;system there is quite a bit of degeneracy. The trouble occurs when, at some point during the evolution of the landscape, there are more configurations at some local minimum than there are states that correspond to the global minimum. When this occurs, the energy of the local minimum crosses below that of the global minimum and the system falls into that state. As the operator prods the system further along the path to the solution, the quantum bits become trapped in a valley that gradually rises up above the global minimum, leaving it in an end state that's not the correct answer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The solution, according to Dickson, is to make sure that the number of configurations that correspond to the lowest energy state <em>always</em> outnumber those that lead to local minima. This is achieved by expanding the number of qubits so that the solution is read out from some subset of qubits, while the others can flip back and forth between different states. In doing so, they ensure that there are many lowest energy states available.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A consequence of this is that the gap between the solution state and the nearest excited state increases, allowing the evolution from initial state to final state to proceed very fast. The cost, though, is that you will need to double the number of qubits in your system.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dickson is not prepared to shout P = NP just yet, but it is clearly on his mind. He notes the current arguments against an adiabatic quantum computer solving NP-hard problems in polynomial time depend on energy gap arguments. This paper destroys those arguments, leaving only the rather practical argument that no one can build an adiabatic quantum computer yet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And I don't think that particular argument is trivial. Certainly D-Wave&nbsp;has a working device, but no one is sure if it has much in the way of quantumness associated with it. Now, if these results require that the whole system is fully entangled (quantum entanglement) and fully coherent, then expanding the number of qubits to prevent level crossing may come at such a cost that solutions to NP-hard problems remain out of reach. Nevertheless, even if the practicalities get in the way, the mere fact of the existence of a potential polynomial-time solution will certainly make mathematicians sit up and take notice.
