                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                This, from CNN, is a beautiful story about an impressive man, Paul Bridges, mayor of tiny Uvalda, Georgia: “<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/06/28/immigration.georgia.mayor/index.html">Republican mayor in the South becomes unlikely advocate for immigrants</a>.”
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Bridges is an unlikely soldier on the front lines of the nation’s immigration debate. The 58-year-old native Southerner describes himself as a conservative Republican. For years, he knew little about immigrants but didn’t lack strong opinions about them: “They were just low-class people,” he recalled. “They weren’t even able to speak English.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Bridges’ English is laced with a folksy drawl; he tosses out phrases such as “heck no” and “that just flew all over me.” But he can switch into the singsongy Spanish of a Mexican farmworker. And he counts immigrants among his closest friends.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Bridges is one of more than a dozen plaintiffs suing Georgia and its governor, trying to stop the state’s new immigration law. They won a reprieve Monday when a federal judge temporarily blocked parts of the law scheduled to go into effect July 1.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    … Bridges is waging a deeply personal battle.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Enforcement of the Georgia law could put him in prison and tear apart the families of some of his closest friends.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In his City Hall office, just a few feet away from a handbook for Georgia mayors and council members, he keeps a glass paperweight engraved with a Bible verse.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A family of illegal immigrants gave it to him for Christmas.
                                </p>

                                What’s most inspiring to me about this story is Bridges’ account of how his views on immigration came to change. This is a conversion story, a personal testimony, the story of a man being born again:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Bridges knew immigrants were a growing labor force on South Georgia’s farms, but he never heard or saw them.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That changed one afternoon in 1999 when he was looking for lasagna ingredients at a Soperton grocery store.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A brown-skinned couple caught his eye. From the way they leaned toward each other, he knew they were deeply in love. Words tumbled from their mouths — a series of sounds without meaning for Bridges. He listened anyway, wishing he could understand.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He spotted them walking outside the store, plastic grocery bags in hand. “Do ya’ll wanna lift?” he asked. They looked at him quizzically, so he tried again, “Do ya’ll wanna ride?”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The couple and another man piled into his car, pointing the way to their destination a few miles away: two rundown trailers in the middle of a cotton field. Bridges dropped them off and went home to make dinner.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But he couldn’t get what he’d seen out of his mind. Nearly 30 people lived in the two trailers.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A few hours later, Bridges went back to the cotton field, carrying lasagna and his daughter’s Spanish-English dictionary. It was the beginning of a whirlwind journey into a new world that would change his life.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    People he had never noticed embraced him. They taught him new words, served him soup and showed him the pictures of their children taped to the trailer’s walls.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “It made me realize that I need to take another look at myself. … It really brought out the ‘me’ in me,” he said.<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/06/28/immigration.georgia.mayor/index.html"></a>
                                </p>

                                Paul Bridges is facing an uphill battle against overwhelming odds in fighting Georgia’s current wave of anti-immigrant sentiment, but read the whole thing. He’s stronger than anyone he’s up against.
