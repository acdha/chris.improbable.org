                            </p>
                            <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                <span style="color:#000080">This report is the first comprehensive overview of NSF. It examines the management of the agency, recognizes many of its accomplishments and successes, identifies some areas for improvements, and questions some of its priorities and funding decisions.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                <span style="color:#000080">The good news for taxpayers is there is no question NSF has contributed significantly to scientific discovery.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                <span style="color:#000080">The bad news is a significant percentage of your money is going to what most Americans will consider fraud, waste and abuse, and there are many areas where NSF could contribute far more with better management and smarter targeting of resources.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                <span style="color:#000080">This report identifies over $3 billion in mismanagement at NSF. This includes tens of millions of dollars spent on questionable studies, excessive amounts of expired funds that have not been returned to the Treasury, inadequate contracting practices that unnecessarily increase costs, and a lack of metrics to demonstrate results. Additionally, a significant portion of the agency’s budget is spent on efforts duplicating missions performed by other government agencies and a number of NSF officials and grantees have been caught engaging in inappropriate behaviors, but face little or no consequences.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Aside from the introductory nod in the direction of NSF's positive contributions, and a page and a half on "Transformative Research Funded by NSF", essentially all of this 73-page report is negative. There's an explicit assumption that non-"transformative" research is a waste of money; but of course most of the report focuses on research that is not only not "transformative", but is depicted as "questionable" or worse.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some of this is straightforward scandal: alleged peculation, porn, fraud, and so forth. Some of it strikes me as just a tad hypocritical, coming from a U.S. Senator: complaints about duplication of effort, missed deadlines, accounting oddities, and other things that have been developed into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Coburn#Use_of_Senatorial_.27hold.27_privilege">legislative-bureaucratic art forms</a> on Capital Hill. But the core of the report is the 25 pages on "Questionable NSF Projects", which leads with a study on “The Role of Social Network Sites in Facilitating Collaborative Processes” –&nbsp; billed as "Does playing FarmVille on Facebook help people to make friends and keep them?" — and ends with a project on a "3-D, multi-user virtual environment (MUVE) of the 1964/65 New York World's Fair".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A few of these projects really are questionable, in my opinion. If that weren't true, NSF wouldn't be doing its job.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Opinions naturally differ about the relative priority of various scientific questions, and about the likely pay-off of different approaches to answering them. NSF tries hard to get good consensus advice about all this, and to strike an appropriate balance between caution and risk in placing its funding bets, just as any other investment portfolio manager should do. In this situation, if I weren't skeptical in advance about some of their choices, and if in the end some of their choices didn't fail, that would be striking evidence that their choices were way too cautious. And the moderately low correlation between my own tastes and the quality of research-project outcomes is just more evidence that there's no magic route to rewards without risks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But what Sen. Coburn's report does is something radically different than just expressing an individual's opinions about research portfolio alternatives. Nor is he making an argument that NSF has its risk/return goals set wrong. Instead, he's arguing that NSF's procedures for assessing projects are fundamentally flawed; and his rhetorical method is to highlight particular projects that are argued to be silly and useless.&nbsp; However, those of his examples that I've checked rely on misunderstood or half-understood project descriptions, or results taken out of context and otherwise misrepresented.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This kind of research-project gotcha! is a game that's easy to play in a (sincerely or cynically) stupid way, as Senator William Proxmire used to demonstrate with his Golden Fleece awards. (See <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/HUTCHINSON.html">here</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Tahaz-0F6zMC&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;ots=FRMmEYYpSd&amp;dq=Labov%20%22golden%20fleece%22&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q=Labov%20%22golden%20fleece%22&amp;f=false">here</a>, <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/getArticle.cfm?id=2001">here</a> for some details of specific awards).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At least one of Sen. Coburn's "questionable projects" involves speech and language:
                            </p>
                            <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                <span style="color:#000080"><strong>Do twitter users “tweet” in regional slang?</strong> Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University received an NSF grant to perform a study of tens of thousands of tweets.&nbsp; A “tweet” refers to a 140-character or less post on the popular social networking site known as “twitter.” The conclusion was that, “regional slang and dialects are as evident in tweets as they are in everyday conversations.”</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As <a href="http://news.cs.cmu.edu/article.php?a=2524">CMU's response indicates</a>, this passage takes work out of context ("the Twitter study was just one of more than 30 research papers" connected with the cited grant, which partly funded a broad range of work on social media),&nbsp; ignores the real and practical applications of such work ("Whether to promote positive uses or to counter negative uses, it’s important to understand the nature of interactions via social networking and how they evolve"), and fails to note that the research in question was also partly funded by the U.S. Defense Department and by Google.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My main reaction to Sen. Coburn's report is to note that the FY2010 budget appropriation for NSF's "Research and Related Activities" account was a bit under $7 billion. A&nbsp; significant portion of that was for large on-going projects like the polar programs (funding U.S. Antarctic research stations, for example) which take up half a billion dollars or so; as I understand it, about $5 billion went for research grants. This is a significant amount of money — but it's about a quarter of annual federal expenditures on agricultural subsidies, and a bit less than the current monthly cost of the Afghan war.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There's been a <a href="http://news.google.com/news/search?aq=f&amp;pz=1&amp;cf=all&amp;ned=us&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Coburn+NSF&amp;btnmeta_news_search=Search+News">certain amount of press response</a> to Sen. Coburn's report. My favorite, so far, is Erico Guizzo, "<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-software/us-senator-calls-robot-projects-wasteful">U.S. Senator Calls Robot Projects Wasteful. Robots Call Senator Wasteful</a>", <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> 6/14/2011. Among other things, this article asserts that the report mischaracterizes the research, gets the grant references and amounts wrong, makes false claims (for instance that NSF paid $1.5 million for a robot that in fact was obtained for free), and never contacted the scientists involved to check facts or get comments.
                            </p>

                                Not far behind on my list is a letter to the Muskogee Phoenix from one of Sen. Coburn's constituents, "<a href="http://muskogeephoenix.com/opinion/x318127574/THE-PEOPLE-SPEAK-Antarctic-gelatin-wrestling-no-big-deal">Antarctic gelatin wrestling no big deal</a>", 6/9/2011:

                                <span style="color:#800000">While in Antarctica working for Raytheon and the National Science Foundation, you are subject to working conditions that you cannot imagine. To say that it is harsh is an extreme understatement. You work six days a week anywhere from eight to 12 hours per day. Much of it outside, walking much of the time because of the high cost of transporting fuel.&nbsp; It is cold and windy, and nearly everything you do during your stay there is in support of the science. […]</span>
                            </p>
                            <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                <span style="color:#800000">Yes, we had some unusual entertainment activities. It’s an unusual place. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys,&nbsp; restaurants or golf courses Mr. Coburn. To ridicule and deny the dedicated and hardworking people there any form of recreation is unrealistic; it was a cheap shot.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                <span style="color:#800000">I would gladly pay for the 30 or 40 boxes of jello that were used that Sunday if Mr. Coburn thinks that a little recreation for hard working people, isolated in a desolate place, is the correct area to save money.</span>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Jell--Gelatin-Dessert-Fusion-3-Ounce/dp/B000SV90J8/">quick web search</a> indicates that the cost for 30 to 40 standard-sized boxes of jello would be $30 to $35 plus shipping. I'd be happy to underwrite that myself, in return for naming rights ("The Annual Language Log Polar Jello Wrestling Challenge"?). And I wonder how many questionable expenditures of $35 or more could be found in a careful scrutiny of travel and entertainment expenditures by U.S. Senators.
