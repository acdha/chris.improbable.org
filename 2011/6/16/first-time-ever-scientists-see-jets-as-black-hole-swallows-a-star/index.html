                                Gamma ray bursts are produced by some of the most energetic objects in the Universe, such as stars collapsing into supernovae. NASA's <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/main/index.html">Swift observatory</a> is designed to catch these rare events as they unfold, with hardware and software that detect sudden spikes in high-energy photons and respond by pointing the main hardware at their source. In March of this year, a somewhat unusual object set off the observatory's gamma ray trigger, and then did something that the scientists running the hardware called "unheard of"—it set it off three more times in less than 48 hours.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Normally, things catch the Swift's attention by exploding, which is a one-time-only event, so the multiple triggering was already unusual. But looking through previous sweeps of the region showed that the source, called Sw 1644+57, was already present several days before setting off the trigger, and the source continued to emit prodigious X-rays for more than two weeks afterward. Also unusual was the variability of the emissions; the X-ray flux varied by a factor of two on timescales as short as 100 seconds.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Running the numbers on an unprecedented event
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                But the truly eye-popping figures came when researchers calculated the amount of energy released by Sw 1644+57. The brightest X-ray flare they detected pumped out over 10<sup>48</sup>ergs/second, and the total output during the first 11 days is estimated at over 10<sup>53</sup>ergs. For those of you not up on your ergs, that's over 10<sup>30</sup> megatons or, as the authors put it, "equivalent to ~10% of the rest energy of the Sun."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Any way you slice it, that's a lot of energy, and we haven't seen anything like it before. The papers that describe it are filled with superlatives that are a bit unusual in a scientific paper, with one saying that Sw 1644+57 is "well beyond the bright end of the quasar luminosity function" and "more luminous (by a factor of ~100) than flares from the brightest blazars."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fortunately, Swift was able to pinpoint the location of Sw 1644+57, and ground- and space-based observatories imaged it at a huge range of wavelengths. At visible wavelengths, it looked like an ordinary, star forming galaxy, with a brightness similar to that of our neighbor, the Large Magellanic Cloud. Deeper into the infrared end of the spectrum, however, very bright emissions were also present, and prone to the same sort of variability seen with high-energy photons. But the variability at different wavelengths didn't line up all that well (a burst of X-rays did not necessarily mean a burst in the infrared), suggesting more than one process was at work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The authors of the paper quoted above sum it up by saying that "we are observing an unprecedented astrophysical object."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So what might it be? The observations indicated that Sw 1644+57 was occurring at the center of the galaxy that hosted it, which suggests it's driven by the supermassive black hole that is predicted to reside there. But, normally, black holes—even supermassive ones—don't suddenly start emitting this much energy. The two papers provide a long list of reasons to think that this isn't simply a case of a supermassive black hole encountering enough gas to become an active galactic nucleus.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For starters, the predicted time scales for a quiescent one to become an active galactic nucleus is well beyond a typical human lifetime. To produce this much power through a normal process, the black hole would have to be so large that it would outweigh the total mass of all the stars present in the host galaxy. Finally, as noted above, the event was far brighter than any of the previously observed quasars and blasars that are the products of active galactic nuclei.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Explaining the unprecedented
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The normal processes driven by supermassive black holes appear to be insufficient to power something like this, but the location at the center of a host galaxy strongly hints that something unusual is going on. So the authors of one of the papers that describes Sw 1644+57 proposes a model that might be able to account for its unusual behavior.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An active galactic nucleus occurs when a supermassive black hole attracts enough gas to provide itself with a steady diet. Under these conditions, a large accretion disk forms at its equator, and jets of material are expelled at near relativistic speeds from the black hole's poles. The energetic particles in these jets release lots of energy through synchrotron radiation, where photons are emitted as charged particles shift direction within a magnetic field. Photons can also be boosted to higher energies through inverse Compton scattering, where a high-energy particle absorbs a photon, then emits a higher-energy one while losing some of its own energy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If we look at one of these from the side, we see light scattered out of the jets, and call it a quasar. If we happen by chance to stare straight down the axis of one of the jets, then we see even more energy, and call it a blasar.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By analogy, the authors think that we're looking down the barrel of a near relativistic jet originating from a black hole, but we can't be looking at the steady inflow of gas seen in most cases. So they suggest that Swift was looking straight down onto a black hole as a star got close enough to be torn apart and swallowed. This would explain the suddenness of the event's onset. They suggest that the lack of signal in the visible spectrum is probably a product of some dust sitting between us and Sw 1644+57, which absorbed the event's output in that area of the spectrum.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The energies involved also let them estimate the acceleration the jets were providing to particles within them, and find that it comes out to be around 10<sup>20</sup>electronVolts, which is in the neighborhood of the highest energy cosmic rays observed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, this is the only event of its sort that Swift has spotted in six years of monitoring, which suggests that they are some combination of very rare, not typically so energetic, or often end up completely obscured by intervening objects.&nbsp;
