Along with a great&nbsp;story, the meat of the talk was about the concessions you have to make with a&nbsp;mobile API with respect to data transfer rates and connectivity. Some of the&nbsp;things they said struck a chord with my own experiences of designing mobile&nbsp;APIs, and inspired me to write this post about those experiences, principles, problems, solutions - and an idea for the future.

                                What's a REST API?

                            <p>
                                There are probably as many definitions of what a REST API is as there are&nbsp;implementations (so naturally I'll add my own), but they all share some common characteristics:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>They recognise that the web is composed of resources, and&nbsp;are structured around that
                                </li>
                                <li>They use the underlying HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with&nbsp;resources
                                </li>
                                <li>Representations of those resources are what actually flow back and forth&nbsp;between REST API servers and clients
                                </li>
                                <li>URIs (usually URLs, which I'll use for the remainder of the article) are&nbsp;used to identify&nbsp;application state - particularly information on what the client can do next - andis contained within the representations received from the server.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">Wikipedia article on REST</a> for one description of what&nbsp;it means to be RESTful.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Resources
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                When you design a REST API, the first task is usually to consider what&nbsp;resources you want to expose to web clients. This is often pretty&nbsp;straightforward: a reasonable approach is often to use the same arrangement as&nbsp;your underlying data model (be that tables in a relational database, document&nbsp;types in a document management system, and so on). This doesn't have to be the case, of course - in particular, you'd be unlikely to expose a link table that facilitates a many-to-many relation in a relational database as an individual resource, for example.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let's say we're building an API for a pizza shop. We're probably going to&nbsp;have a Pizza resource, a Topping resource, and an Order resource.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Resources tend to be arranged hierarchically, probably due to the nature of&nbsp;the URLs used to address them. It's therefore common to have resources in an&nbsp;API that work as collections of other resources. The URL for a topping resource&nbsp;might be `http://pizza.com/toppings/cheese`. The URL of the collection resource&nbsp;for all toppings would be `http://pizza.com/toppings/`.&nbsp;(The presence of absence of a trailing slash is meaningless, but for the purpose&nbsp;of this article I'll use the convention of collection resources having a&nbsp;trailing slash.)
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Representations
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Representations are how the client and server talk about a resource. Prior to&nbsp;the advent of machine-usable APIs, HTML was the most common form of representation.&nbsp;These days, XML and JSON representations are commonly used for machine-readable representations. PDF, JPEG, and MP3&nbsp;are also all perfectly good representations of a resource as is, of course, good old HTML.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Keep in mind that a resource may have more than one representation. You might&nbsp;be able to fetch a resource as HTML (useful for humans) and JSON (useful for&nbsp;machines). It's also important to realise that representations are not simply&nbsp;content types: there's no reason a resource can't have multiple JSON&nbsp;representations, for example. This idea becomes important a little later on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once you've defined your resources, therefore, thinking of representations is&nbsp;usually the next step. The default choice of a simple JSON representation, with&nbsp;a key per resource attribute, is a common choice. That will do for now. A&nbsp;representation of our Topping resource might therefore look like this:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
{<br> "calories": 100, <br> "name": "Cheese"<br>}
</pre>
                            <p>
                                Resources may need to refer to other resources. This should be done in a self-describing way: the client should not need to have any knowledge of the server application to build its own URLs. Seeing keys like 'foo_id' in a JSON representation is usually a sign of this design error. For example, this is a reasonable representation:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
{<br> "favourite_topping": "/toppings/cheese"<br>}
</pre>
                            <p>
                                This isn't so good:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
{<br> "favourite_topping_id": "36"<br>}
</pre>
                            <p>
                                That 'favourite_topping_id' is meaningless to the client - it has to know how to construct topping resource URLs to be able to use that data.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Incidentally, note that the examples in this article only include URL paths, rather than full, absolute URLs. Either is fine; as long as the client can resolve them.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Interactions
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The next piece of the usual REST API design process is to consider the&nbsp;operations available for each resource, and what they mean. There are four key&nbsp;operations provided by HTTP - GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. (Actually, HTTP does provide more, but this quartet is what is most normally used in RESTful API design.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These are often compared to the core SQL-based relational database operations&nbsp;of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE. This is slightly misleading. SELECT and&nbsp;GET are fairly similar, as are the two DELETEs; POST and PUT are different&nbsp;beasts though. POST is used for a write operation on a resource that has&nbsp;side-effects. PUT writes to a resource, but has no side-effects.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Put another way, PUT is idempotent - if you do the same PUT twice (and there's&nbsp;no other state changes in between) then the system state will be the same.&nbsp;POST carries no such guarantee.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A good example might be to compare the creation of a new Topping resource with&nbsp;the creation of an Order for a pizza. Creating a Topping would probably&nbsp;consist of something like the following:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
PUT http://pizza.com/toppings/jalapenos<br>{<br>  "calories": 25,<br>  "name": "Jalapeños"<br>}
</pre>
                            <p>
                                This would create the Topping resource at http://pizza.com/toppings/jalapenos.&nbsp;Re-running the request would not make any difference. Changing the 'calories'&nbsp;field in the JSON to a new value would replace the existing resource with the&nbsp;new one. So - PUT has a 'create-or-update' semantic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The response for this request would probably simply be an HTTP 200 response,&nbsp;with an empty body (or more strictly, a 204, which tells the client to maintain its view of the representation.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Contrast this with what creating an order might look like:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
POST http://pizza.com/orders/<br>{<br> "toppings": [<br>   "/toppings/cheese", <br>   "/toppings/jalapenos"<br> ], <br> "card": "1234567890"<br>}
</pre>
                            <p>
                                We've made this a POST request because it has side-effects: it bills your&nbsp;credit card, and sets off the process of making a delicious pizza. Making that&nbsp;same request twice would bill your card twice, and get you two pizzas. POST&nbsp;is not idempotent.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The HTTP response here would probably be 201 Created, with the representation&nbsp;of some Confirmation resource in the body, perhaps looking like this:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
201 Created<br>{<br> "order": "/orders/432544"<br>}
</pre>
                            <p>
                                Note once more how the response contains a self-describing URI, rather than some opaque order ID, which is not meaningful out of context.
                            </p>

                                There are some broken HTTP clients out there. I've run into one: Flash (circa&nbsp;2009). Flash gets upset if it doesn't receive a 200 response from the server.

                                On the Django project on which we ran into this, we ended up writing a custom&nbsp;middleware that looked for the presence of a magic query string parameter on&nbsp;the URL and, if it was found, replaced the status code with a 200 and put the&nbsp;real status code on the first line of the body. The Flash app then parsed out&nbsp;the response code from the response body. Ugly, but workable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Flash also (at the time, it may have changed) was unable to perform PUT or&nbsp;DELETE requests. Our solution was similar: the Flash application would always&nbsp;perform a POST when it actually wanted to do a PUT or DELETE, and the real&nbsp;intended method went into another magic query string parameter. The&nbsp;aforementioned middleware would then rewrite the HTTP method on incoming API&nbsp;requests that carried this flag.

                            <p>
                                The standard approach to expressing errors in a REST API is to use HTTP status codes. As is often the case with REST, this works fine for simple systems, but is simply too limiting for more sophisticated systems, particularly those which might submit a JSON or XML document to describe a POST request. If a client does submit such a rich request, which perhaps does not validate on the server, it is useful to be able to provide more than just a 400 Bad Request error.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since I primarily use Django these days, and Django uses forms and formsets for validation, I have found that providing a standardised JSON representation of form and formset errors works well. The format can be specified in advance, and allows the server to inform the client of rich validation errors (down to field-level validation, with decent error messages) even over an API. I hope to write more on this in a future post.

                                OK, let's say we've got an iPhone app which uses our REST API to place orders&nbsp;and display the calorific content of the toppings we added. Let's look at the&nbsp;response that it might receive from a GET request to our Order resource:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
GET /orders/432544<br><br>200 OK<br>{<br> "toppings": [<br>   "/toppings/cheese", <br>   "/toppings/jalapenos"<br> ]<br>}
</pre>
                            <p>
                                That's cool - the client can see that there are a couple of toppings there,&nbsp;so it fetches each one to get the calorific content:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
GET /toppings/cheese<br>200 OK<br>{<br> "calories": 100, <br> "name": "Cheese"<br>}
</pre>
                            <p>
                                And then:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
GET /toppings/jalapenos<br><br>{<br> "calories": 25, <br> "name": "Jalapeños"<br>}
</pre>
                            <p>
                                That's great. Our iPhone app can tell our user that the pizza they ordered&nbsp;has 125 calories.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What's not so great is that our iPhone app has had to make three separate&nbsp;requests. This works fine in development, across the office wifi network to&nbsp;the dev server. It doesn't work so well when a user's ordering a pizza on the&nbsp;train home from work, and the train goes into a tunnel halfway through this&nbsp;multi-request conversation (and the user was outside a 3G signal anyway).

                            <p>
                                The natural response (and probably the right response) is simply to extend&nbsp;the representation of an Order resource to include the required&nbsp;representations of our toppings. This means that our Order resource&nbsp;representation now looks like this:
                            </p>
                            <pre>

</pre>
                            <p>
                                That's cool. Our iPhone app now only needs to make one request, and it gets&nbsp;all the information on the toppings as well. We've traded the brevity of the&nbsp;original representation of the Order resource for not having to make multiple&nbsp;requests. The individual Topping representations are still available, of course.
                            </p>

                                To (ab)use database parlance, we've denormalised our Order representation, trading&nbsp;size for performance (that is, a smaller representation will be quicker to&nbsp;download).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, wind the clock forward a few months. We've extended our iPhone app and&nbsp;the supporting REST API to cover table reservations, meal pre-ordering, and so&nbsp;on. We've run into the problem described above, so we've heavily optimised our&nbsp;API responses to minimise HTTP round trips. Life is good. Right?

                                We're approached by a company who have developed an Android app that can&nbsp;use our API, wondering if we'd be happy to make it the official Android app.&nbsp;It's an awesome piece of software. They've thought about the user experience&nbsp;in a totally different way, and it works well on Android (though the current&nbsp;iPhone app approach works best on iPhone). The only real problem is that some&nbsp;of the API requests they make download a ton of data that they simply don't&nbsp;need; and they have to make lots of other smaller requests to make other parts&nbsp;of their app work as they want.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In other words, they want a <b>different</b> set of optimisation choices for the API.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What do we do? Add a new API version with different optimisations (even though&nbsp;it's still dealing with the same set of resources) in the representations?&nbsp;That doesn't sound so great, as we'd be maintaining two APIs. It doesn't&nbsp;scale, either - what happens when someone writes an app for the TV, which&nbsp;needs another set of tradeoffs?

                            <p>
                                (Note that this section outlines a possible solution - I don't have an implementation for this yet.)

                            <p>
                                The key insight is that the applications do not require different resources.&nbsp;They merely need different representations of those resources.&nbsp;Some frameworks allow this to be done by specifying an extension on the end&nbsp;of the URL. If we did that, we'd end up with:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
http://pizza.com/toppings/cheese.xml<br>http://pizza.com/toppings/cheese.json
</pre>
                            <p>
                                While not strictly wrong, this isn't ideal when thinking in resources.&nbsp;Different URLs mean different resources. Just because both XML and JSON&nbsp;representations are available doesn't double the number of resources - it's&nbsp;all the same cheese topping. We need some way of expressing what&nbsp;representation we want for a given resource. Ideally, we shouldn't change the&nbsp;URL.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Fortunately, HTTP gives us the tools to do this: the HTTP Accept header. It's usually&nbsp;used for specifying content types: text/html, application/json, and so on.&nbsp;However, the specification allows for extra parameters. Let's take a&nbsp;look (from <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html</a>):
                            </p>
                            <pre>
Accept         = "Accept" ":"<br>#( media-range [ accept-params ] )<br><br>media-range    = ( "*/*"<br> | ( type "/" "*" )<br> | ( type "/" subtype )<br> ) *( ";" parameter )<br>accept-params  = ";" "q" "=" qvalue *( accept-extension )<br>accept-extension = ";" token [ "=" ( token | quoted-string ) ]
</pre>
                            <p>
                                That means that a client could send a request like this:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
GET /orders/432544<br>Accept: application/json;q=1;depth=1,application/json
</pre>
                            <p>
                                Here, we've added a depth parameter to the acceptable types. This depth&nbsp;parameter works a little like the numeric depth parameter to a Django queryset's&nbsp;`select_related` method call - it asks the server to traverse one level deep into related resources. The standard also specifies that more specific content types take precedence over less specific types - which means that we have a mechanism for the client to allow fallback to a normal JSON representation of the resource. If the server cannot provide a representation that fulfils any of the values in the Accept header, it would return a 406 Not Acceptable.

                                What's that 'q' parameter? It's what appears to be a historical quirk of the spec, where q is used to specify a 'quality' - used to allow the choice of a variety of representations based on degrading quality, eg. sample rate for sound. It's baked into the accept-params definition, so we include it here.

                                Let's compare two requests, one before using the proposed Accept convention, and one after:

                            <p>
                                This is exactly the same request as we saw before, but with an explicit Accept header, specifying that the client is prepared to accept the normal form of the response. Let's see what might happen if a depth is specified:
                            </p>
                            <pre style="padding-left:1em">

                            <p>
                                We can now see the client expressing that it can accept resource representations nested to a single level - and the server responds in kind. Note that the client also specified that it could accept the normal form - so it would be valid for the server to respond with the first, normal form even to this second request.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What if the server could not fulfil the request? Perhaps the backend is unable to perform the join required to provide the nested data, and the client specified that it could only accept that nested representation:
                            </p>
                            <pre style="padding-left:1em">

                            <p>
                                It might be sensible for the server to provide the normal representation in the body anyway, in case the client was able to process it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In particular, this response might be used to prevent (or mitigate) DoS attacks; depending on the application, the server might impose a depth limit of 2 or 3 levels.
                            </p>

                                The approach outlined above would afford clients some flexibility in 'denormalising' the data that they receive on request, avoiding both the need for developers to create custom code to nest related data and the tendency for APIs to become over-specialised to the needs of one particular API client over time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's also cacheable - the Accept header should form part of the cache key, and provides a graceful degradation for servers which cannot perform the data nesting request.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However,it's not a silver bullet: in particular, it's not clear how one might implement an analogue to Django's .select_related('foo', 'bar') form, where the API consumer could specify which resources it wished to be nested in the main resource requested. Instead, all the client can specify is a simple depth, and may therefore receive far more nested information than it might actually need.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As far as I can see, there are two problems to solve before being able to implement this more specific second form:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Perhaps including an XPath-like parameter in the Accept header might work here (tweaked suitably to apply to JSON documents too); but how would the client know which paths were expandable without requesting the normal form to start with?
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                Implementation details aside, I do think that setting a convention (even of a limited form, such as the depth approach described above) would increase the usefulness of APIs. Perhaps I'll even get around to a Tastypie/Piston extension to implement it!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Comments on the approach, improvements and especially criticisms, are welcome in the comments.
