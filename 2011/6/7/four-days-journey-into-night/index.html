                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Dutch are a cycling nation. What's less well known is that they're a walking nation as well.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are two common verbs for "to walk" in Dutch: <em>lopen</em> and <em>wandelen</em>. <em>Lopen</em> is the ordinary verb for going somewhere by Shank's mare. But if one is walking just to walk, as way leads on to way, that's <em>wandelen</em>. It's cognate to Wordsworth's "wandering lonely as a cloud," but without the flavor of aimlessness that the term carries in English. Dutch <em>wandelaars</em> know where they're going. They're purposefully recreational.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most Dutch children are introduced to the pleasures of walking through <em>avondvierdaagsen</em>, literally, "four days' evenings". These are annual events, usually in late May or early June, where people of all ages get together with their neighbors and walk around their local areas for four evenings in a row. They're usually organized through local schools, so they bias toward children and accompanying parents, and tend to cover 5, 10, or 15 km (3, 6, or 9 miles) per evening. Fiona completed her second 5 km walk this evening. She'll be out again tomorrow and Thursday.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And it's an extraordinary sight to run across of a spring evening. We live near a nature reserve, and during <em>avondvierdaagse</em> season, the paths are thronged with kids, chattering and singing nonsense songs with their friends while the adults stroll along behind them. Everyone carries chilled oranges and lemons, cut in half and wrapped in handkerchiefs (one squeezes the fruit and sucks the juice through the cloth). But I've cycled through urban neighborhoods and seen the groups walking together there too, spilling off of the sidewalk and onto the roads, like parades without heroes or marshalls.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <em>Avondvierdaagsen</em> are the gentle introduction to <em>marsen</em>, marches, which serious walkers undertake. There are a couple of <em>vierdaagsen</em> that don't take place in the <em>avond</em>. They cover 30 - 50 km (20 - 30 miles) per day, four days in a row. The eastern city of Nijmegen's <em>vierdaagse</em> is particularly famous. It's been held annually since 1909, with only a brief break during the First World War (the Netherlands was neutral, but mustered troops) and another during the German occupation (<em>vierdaagsen</em> were classed as illegal gatherings).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                More dedicated walkers yet participate in <em>Kennedymarsen</em>. These are a Dutch survival of an American fad from 1963: the 50-mile hike. It's all John F. Kennedy's fault. One of the themes of his early Presidency was an emphasis on the physical fitness of Americans. And after hearing about similar exercises from Teddy Roosevelt's time, he enquired whether American marines could cover 50 miles in the space of 20 hours. His brother Bobby did just that the subsequent weekend (in oxfords, in the snow). This led to a brief distance-walking craze that spring, among military and civilians alike.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By that summer, the fad had passed in America. But it's still going strong in the Netherlands, particularly in the south. There are 13 <em>Kennedymarsen</em> per year, according to the organization that coordinates them (the KNBLO*). The largest, the Sittard Kennedymars, has been held annually since 1963. Over 2600 participants registered to walk 50 miles in 20 hours in 2011, starting at 5 a.m. on Holy Saturday, finishing by 1 a.m. on Easter Sunday.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Of course, most Dutch people don't go quite that far. But about a third of the staff at my first workplace here took a walk together every lunchtime. And the nature reserve near us is always filled with walkers, usually in groups. Even the best amusement park in the nation, the Efteling, is constructed to give the feel of a Sunday stroll through the woods (albeit one where one stumbles upon roller coasters in every clearing).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And it starts with children carrying citrus fruit in handkerchiefs, putting one foot in front of the other, through leaves, over bridges, during four evenings in the spring.
