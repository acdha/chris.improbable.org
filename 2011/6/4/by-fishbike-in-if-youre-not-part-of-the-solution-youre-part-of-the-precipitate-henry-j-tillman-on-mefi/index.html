                        <blockquote>
                            I had something like this happen in a grade school "computers" class. Our assignment was to write a program that would compute and print out all the prime numbers between 2 and 1000. And whoever wrote the fastest program to do that would win some nominal prize.<br>
                            <br>
                            This was actually something I had already done years earlier when I got my first computer, so I had a whole bag of tricks already in my head for doing this. The other students programs all took the obvious approach of testing every number by trying to divide it by every smaller number to see if it divides evenly, and if it doesn't, print it out.<br>
                            <br>
                            That works and starts out quickly, but gets slower and slower. My program started out quite slow and got progressively faster, and after just a few seconds, would print numbers faster than you could read them.<br>
                            <br>
                            I got in trouble because the teacher concluded I "must have cheated somehow". And when I explained I'd just used the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm</a>, which is fast partly because it only uses addition (a fast operation on computers) and no division (which is really slow), he said "it is impossible to calculate prime numbers without doing division!"<br>
                            <br>
                            At which point I was saved by the math teacher across the hall, who had heard the whole exchange. He stormed in, said "(teacher's name), you're a fucking idiot!" and proceeded to explain the algorithm to the entire class, drawing it on the chalkboard as he went. And he concluded with "Why do they let you teach this class anyway?" and stormed back out.<br>
                            <br>
                            I forget who actually ended up getting the prize.
