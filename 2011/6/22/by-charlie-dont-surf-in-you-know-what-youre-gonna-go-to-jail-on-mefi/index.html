                        <blockquote>
                            Yeah, this is really pissing me off. I've made my own stand for personal liberties. I'll tell you a little story.<br>
                            <br>
                            About a year ago, a friend of mine asked me to drop her off at the bus station at 9:30PM to get an intercity bus. I told her the station is closed at that hour, and you have to wait outside in a not-so-good neighborhood, I'm sure as hell not dropping you off, I'll wait with you until the bus comes.<br>
                            <br>
                            So I park my car about a half block away and I wait with her. She's a short black girl about 24 dressed in a weird anime-inspired hoodie with floppy Pokemon ears, and I'm a tall white guy in his 50s, wearing black jeans and a black leather jacket. So as we're standing there waiting, a cop from the downtown bike patrol rolls up. They hired some cops to patrol downtown on bikes to stop sexual assaults on coeds walking home. But they're a little off their turf here. A cop comes up to me, he's wearing a ridiculous outfit with a silly bike helmet, he's a foot shorter than me, and has a ridiculous porn moustache. I can hardly stop from laughing at him. He comes up to me and says, "Can I see your ID?" In a deliberately calm, almost offhanded tone, I flatly say, "no." He says I have to. I say that this state doesn't have any law requiring me to show my papers, this isn't a Terry Stop, I'm on the public pavement and I don't need to show papers. He insists I do. I insist I don't, I'd just looked it up after reading of some similar incident online. He says that I match the description of a wanted felon who was reported in this area. I said, "yeah right, what was his description." And the cop literally looks me from bottom to top, describing ME, "the suspect was wearing black shoes, black jeans, a leather jacket, a white shirt, short hair with grey around his temples, wearing eyeglasses." I said I didn't believe him, and that description matched thousands of people in this town. The cop insisted if I don't identify myself, he'll just take me to jail for obstruction of justice. I tell him if he does that, he'll look pretty damn stupid when they book me and find out you arrested the wrong suspect, for no legitimate reason. Cop gets up on his tiptoes (!!!) and puts his nose right in my face, and starts screaming at me, "I'm not backing down! You're going to show me ID right now!" I can tell he's just dying for me to take a swing at him, but I refuse to even get bothered, which seems to upset him even more. So I tell him, I'll compromise. I'll verbally identify myself but I will not show ID, and I tell him my name. He says that's not good enough.<br>
                            <br>
                            Meanwhile, bike cop's partner is harassing my friend. She's freaking out, since she's from the inner city and I suppose she's been harassed by cops most of her life. She takes the cop down the block and shows him my car, the cop runs my plates, and of course it matches the name I gave the cop. Ooh I wish she hadn't done that, she wasn't required to, and it undermined my whole point. But oh well.<br>
                            <br>
                            Despite me giving my name and it matching the name my car is registered under, bike cop refuses to back down. He keeps screaming at me, "I'm not backing down!" I basically dare him to arrest me, which would obviously be pretty stupid if I actually WAS a wanted felon, and he damn well knows this. I tell him, "well I guess you'll have to arrest me because I'm not going to show you my ID." He keeps glaring at me, at one point he gets up on his tippy toes again and is yelling in my face so close I can feel the spittle, and he bumps chests with me. I actually snort with laughter, which I can tell is not giving this short cop with an obvious inferiority complex, the feeling he wants, of dominating me. He insists I stay right where I am while he calls for backup. I tell him I haven't moved 1 foot for the last 10 minutes, I'm waiting for the bus with my friend and I'm staying here until the bus comes.<br>
                            <br>
                            So as I wait there with 2 ridiculous bike cops glaring at me, my friend freaking out quietly, in a cool evening, over the next 15 minutes, 4 patrol cars and 10 officers arrive on scene. In fact, there's so many damn cops that when the intercity bus comes, it just drives off, thinking there's some major crime in progress. I steadfastly refuse to show my ID to every cop, including a couple who I know from chatting with them while on patrol downtown. Finally a sergeant arrives on scene. He says, "Oh, I know your family. Do you know 'Chuck ****?" I say sure I do, that's my uncle, my dad named me after his brother Chuck. He said, "Oh, you're Frank's son." I said, "of course, when I gave my full name VERBALLY, I said my middle name was Frank. That was my dad's name."<br>
                            <br>
                            So now the cops are starting to get the idea, this bike cop has been harassing a completely innocent citizen, in fact, a son of a well known local businessman. The Sergeant asks me "are you SURE you don't want to just help us out and show your ID?" I said, "I most definitely do not. I didn't just do this so the City could squander police resources on a wild goose chase. I did this to stand up for my civil rights. I'm an employee of the State, it is my job to uphold people's civil rights, just like your job. And we take civil rights very seriously, you might remember our State Motto, 'Our Liberties we Prize..'" And to my astonishment, the cop finishes for me, "..And our Rights We Will Maintain." I ask if I'm free to leave, and he asks me to stay for a moment while he smoothes things out with Bike Cop. I tell him that he probably realizes that I feel like I deserve an apology, while I also realize I'm not going to get one.<br>
                            <br>
                            The Sergeant goes over to Bike Cop, who starts yelling at him, "I'm not backing down!!" Well apparently he received orders to back down. I am free to go. Bike Cop glares at me again, puts on his ridiculous styrofoam helment, and rolls off. I give my friend a ride back to her place, she's jittery, but I'm not. She has to take the bus the next day.<br>
                            <br>
                            Now this wasn't the last time I saw this cop downtown. I'm at the Public Library a few weeks later, setting up an early polling site, working for the County, I'm the Precinct Chairman. And under a newly passed State law, I am officially given police powers of arrest, and empowered to detain and arrest anyone who disrupts the polling place. And in the midst of this setup, while a designated County official is required to be present to watch us count the blank ballots, Bike Cop comes in and starts yelling and having a fit. He yells at the County official that he has to move the County Vehicle RIGHT NOW. I haven't seen who it was, my back was turned, and as I turn towards Bike Cop, he sees me and I can see him freeze, he's stunned to see me, and I'm wearing a big badge with my name written on it and logos for the County with CHAIRMAN on it. I start yelling at him, "Hey, it's YOU. I've had trouble with YOU before! We are COUNTY employees, we outrank you, you're just a CITY employee. You have no right to tell a County employee to move his car, he's required by State Law to be present right now. He'd break the law if he left. And under State Law, I have the power to arrest YOU, if you don't stop disrupting our polling site RIGHT NOW. I'll arrest you and call the Chief of Police if you don't leave NOW." And I pick up my phone and turn it on. Bike Cop looks at me with that deer-stunned-in-the-headlights look and stammers, "Y--Y--Yeah, y-y-you do that," and almost runs out the door. Ha!<br>
                            <br>
                            Now the other pollworkers are like 80 year old retirees and they are stunned, one of them tells me I shouldn't talk to cops like that. And I say, "well I just did. That's my job as Precinct Chairman." After the polls are open and things are set, I told the County official my history with Bike Cop, he laughs and laughs.<br>
                            <br>
                            So until we meet again, Bike Cop. You really ought to get some other job that doesn't involve dealing with the public.
