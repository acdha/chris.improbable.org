                                One depressingly common occurrence for those of us who read Radley Balko’s blog and the ACLU’s blog is hearing of cases where innocent people sat in prison even though prosecutors were aware of strong exculpatory evidence.  <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-court-innocence-20110403,0,1867335.story">This LA Times article is just more reason to be depressed</a>.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>

                                    In last week’s opinion, Scalia cited the Youngblood case in arguing that prosecutors are not required to offer all the evidence that might free a defendant. “We have decided a case that appears to say just the opposite,” he wrote. “In Arizona v. Youngblood, we held that unless a criminal defendant can show bad faith on the part of the police,” the defendant does not have a right to obtain all “potentially useful evidence.”
                                </p>

                                The job of  police and prosecutors is to find and punish criminals in order to protect the liberties of the innocent.  If they do not hand over all potentially exculpatory evidence that they come across, they are compromising their ability to do that job, because they are opening up the possibility of letting the guilty go free while the innocent are punished.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As far as what the law ought to say about this, and how it should be administered, I will defer to those who have thought more deeply about the system and its incentives on issues of exactly when/how to hold prosecutors liable, what the threshold ought to be, whether the wrongfully-convicted should be suing the prosecutors as individuals or suing the state, etc.  What I will say is that the system is woefully out of balance, that some heads need to roll, and that more innocent people need to get more and bigger compensation payouts.  Unless there are significant penalties for withholding exculpatory evidence, and for dragging heels on simple tests that could resolve cases one way or the other (e.g. DNA tests of evidence already in the possession of the DA) I see no hope that balance will be restored.
