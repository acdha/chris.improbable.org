                                Business Insider has a pair of articles about what they say is the real story about the founding of Twitter. The first is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-twitter-was-founded-2011-4?op=1">a general outline of the unofficial history of the company</a> versus what you generally hear from the company and its founders.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Glass insists that he is not Twitter's sole founder or anything like it. But he feels betrayed that his role has basically been expunged from Twitter history. He says Florian Webber doesn't get enough credit, either.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "Some people have gotten credit, some people haven't. The reality is it was a group effort. I didn't create Twitter on my own. It came out of conversations."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    "I do know that without me, Twitter wouldn't exist. In a huge way."
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                The second is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-cofounder-noah-glass-2011-4?op=1">an interview with Noah Glass</a>, who many people who were there at the beginning of the service consider one of the true cofounders of Twitter.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Jack [Dorsey] was someone who was one of the stars of the company and I got the impression he was unhappy with what he was working on. He was doing a lot of cleanup work on Odeo. He and I had become pretty close friends and were spending time together.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He started talking to me about this idea of status and how he was really interested in status. He developed this bicycle messenger status system in the past. I was trying to figure out what it was he found compelling about it. At the same time, we were looking at 'groups' models and how groups were formed and put a couple things together to look at this idea of status and to look at this idea of grouping and it sort of hit me - the idea for this product. This thing that would be called Twitter, what it would look like. This ad hoc grouping mechanism with non-realtime status updates all based on mobile phones.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There was a moment when I was sitting with Jack and I said, "Oh, I do see how this could really come together to make something really compelling." We were sitting on Mission St. in the car in the rain. We were going out and I was dropping him off and having this conversation. There was a moment where it all fit together for me.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We went back to Odeo and put together a team. A very separate working team, mostly it was myself, Jack, and Florian [Webber], a contractor. [Florian] was working from Germany at the time.
                                </p>
