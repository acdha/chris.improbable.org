Sometimes it brings trolls to your door, and other times, it brings the descendants of Civil War heroes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You will recall that <a href="http://emilylhauserinmyhead.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/the-first-trophy-from-fort-sumter/">I recently posted about former slave Robert Smalls</a>, who commandeered a Confederate warship, delivered it to the Union Navy, and freed more than a dozen slaves along the way. Smalls went on to serve in the Union Navy with distinction, eventually becoming a US Congressman.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lo and behold, Smalls’ great-great grandson, Michael B. Moore, found the post over at Angry Black Lady Chronicles, and left a comment!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.stmarksschool.org/gallery/zoom.aspx?myurl=/data/files/News/AlumniNews/Michael_speaking.JPG&amp;Title=Michael%20Boulware%20Moore%20%2780%20Talks%20about%20his%20Great-Great%20Grandfather%20Robert%20Smalls&amp;Content=">Moore</a> frequently <a href="http://www.schumanities.org/home/newsstory/264">speaks publicly</a> about <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=263312872079&amp;comments&amp;ref=mf">Congressman Smalls</a>, and&nbsp;to a history nerd like myself, making this kind of living connection is very exciting. With one brief blog comment, Robert Smalls leapt in my imagination from being a distant figure, to being a real man, his blood and his legacy carried on in the lives of other Americans.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We think that we are so far from that time, that place, those people, that heroism — that need for heroism — and yet the truth is, it’s all very close, indeed (in the immortal phrasing of Louis CK: It’s just two 75 year old ladies, back-to-back).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, I decided that the only reasonable thing to do was to post Mr. Moore’s comment as a follow-up to the Smalls post. (That’s him up there at the top of the page, speaking to the<a href="http://www.educationcounsel.com/resources/press-release.aspx?id=9">South Carolina Hall of Fame</a>). I’m so grateful for the chance to learn more about this courageous man!
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Thanks so much for the post about Robert Smalls, my great great grandfather. I’ll add a few tidbits, if I may. Robert’s mother’s name was Lydia Polite. No one knows where the name “Smalls” came from – perhaps it derived from his stature. You are most certainly right that he was the product of a rape from Lydia’s master. I think the talk about “Goldsmith” is an historical effort to deflect focus from the obvious.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are lots of stories within the family about how Lydia had an enormous impact on Robert’s development; one can only surmise that without regard to the circumstances of his conception, that she loved him dearly and invested everything she had into helping him become the man he was.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In terms of whether she saw him free – the answer is yes. Curiously, she was actually “free” before he was. As I understand it, the Union army took control of the area around Beaufort during the war and, in effect, liberated the slaves there prior to 5/13/1862 – when Robert was a bit further north in Charleston.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You make a great point about the arrogance/ignorance of the officers of the Planter. This is a key aspect of talks I give about Robert Smalls. It’s as if you took a starving person and put them in front of an amazing buffet, left the room, and expected them to NOT reach out and feed themselves. It illustrates the mindset of America at that time when people of African descent were thought of in the same way that one would think of a horse or ox or mule. Robert’s act shocked so many because it caused them to rethink their ridiculous conceptions about those enslaved.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A couple of interesting points about Robert’s accomplishments – after the acclaim of his feat, he met with President Lincoln and persuaded him to accept former slaves into the Union Army. Some historians suggest that the infusion of those incremental resources was the “boost” that the Union needed to help them win the war. As well, when he was in the SC legislature, he authored legislation that created in SC the first free, compulsory, public schools in the nation. Among other things, one can say that Smalls is the father of public school education in America. A few years ago, the US Army honored Smalls with a ship in his name, the MG Robert Smalls. It’s the only ship named after a Civil War era person or an African American!
