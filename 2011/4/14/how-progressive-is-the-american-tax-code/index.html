                                    It’s rather less intuitive that fairness demands that the wealthy not only pay more in taxes, but pay a larger percentage of income. But let’s accept that fairness does require it. Anyway, high-earners in America do pay higher rates. In 2008, the top 1% paid 38% of all federal income taxes, and the top 5% paid 58%. Indeed, America is the industrialised world’s champion of income-tax progressivity! If any country’s upper-crust pays its fair share, America’s does.

                                    Notice the bait and switch there? (If you don’t, my blogging for the past eight years has been for nought.) First, there’s the insistence on judging tax fairness solely by federal income taxes. But if you take a look at total tax burdens (federal/state/local), America’s tax system is only very modestly progressive. Second, there’s the switch from tax rates to tax shares. It’s true that the top 1% pay a big share of all federal income taxes, and there’s a good reason for that: it’s because the top 1% earn a big share of all income.

                                Kevin has a handy chart to help illustrate his point:

                            <p>
                                <a href="http://blogs-images.forbes.com/erikkain/files/2011/04/blog_tax_rates_epi.jpg"><img style="border-bottom:0px;border-left:0px;float:none;margin-left:auto;border-top:0px;margin-right:auto;border-right:0px" title="blog_tax_rates_epi" border="0" alt="blog_tax_rates_epi" src="http://blogs-images.forbes.com/erikkain/files/2011/04/blog_tax_rates_epi_thumb.jpg" width="352" height="304"></a>Here’s the problem with Will’s logic. Even if you had a flat tax and everyone paid 10% of their income as taxes, the wealthy would <em>still</em> pay the largest share. 10% of 1 million is still a lot more than 10% of twenty thousand. (It may not effect the millionaire as badly as it will effect someone living at the poverty line, of course, but that’s another story.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In other words, tax <em>share</em> says nothing at all about the progressivity of tax <em>rates</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There’s a flipside to this as well. As <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/03/25/swedish-inequality-datapoint-of-the-day/">Felix Salmon points out</a>, even countries like Sweden with much higher rates of income redistribution still have enormous divides in equality of wealth:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    The point here is that wealth inequality is ever and always enormous. The US and Sweden are very far apart, when it comes to inequality, but if you look at wealth inequality rather than income inequality — which is the subject of the Norton and Ariely paper — then countries tend to look more alike than different. A huge part of the population of just about every country is going to have zero wealth — if you live paycheck to paycheck, for instance, or if you’re young and haven’t been earning money for long, or if you just spend a lot. That doesn’t mean you’re poor.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In countries like Sweden, indeed, the social safety net is strong enough that you don’t <em>need</em> to build wealth in the same way you do if you’re Chinese, say. Wealth is a form of insurance, and when insurance is nationalized, you need less wealth. As a result, people can enjoy the fruits of their money, instead of saving it up for emergencies or for retirement — and only a small percentage of the population really spends a lot of effort in a successful attempt at accumulating more.
                                </p>
