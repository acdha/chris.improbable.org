                                    Arizona Governor Jan Brewer is signing a bill to remove Balbir Singh Sodhi’s name from the state’s 9/11 memorial and sell his memorial plaque as scrap metal.

He made headlines because he was the first of several cases across the United States that were reported to the police as acts of retaliation for the terrorist attacks

                                    On September 15, 2001, Frank Roque shot him five times, killing him instantly. Roque, who apparently wanted revenge for September 11, confused him for a person of Arab ethnicity because of the clothes he wore, his turban, and his beard. Within 25 minutes of his death, the Phoenix police reported four further attacks on people who either were Middle Easterners or who dressed with clothes thought to be worn by Middle Easterners.

                                    The bill, which passed both houses on party-line votes, was sponsored by Rep. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, who said Monday that he did only a cursory Internet search on Singh Sodhi’s murder. Kavanagh said it was unclear to him that the shooting was directly related to 9/11.

                                    “He was the victim of a madman. He was not a 9/11 victim,” Kavanagh said. “I don’t mean to (dismiss) what happened to this individual. I don’t mean to trivialize it.”

                                    Kavanagh disagrees with arguments by Sikhs that as many as 17 members of their religion were murdered nationally in the aftermath of Sept. 11. A Sikh truck driver was wounded in a shooting in north Phoenix in 2003 by men who shouted a racial slur as well as other, less-violent hate crimes that occurred in Valley.

                                The bill would not just solely remove Sodhi’s experience from the memorial but would remove other narratives that were not to Kavanagh liking as well. This is an outrageous attempt at rewriting history and re-construction of a narrative that leaves out the experiences of the South Asian American community and our September 11th narrative. With all the work that has been done as far as advocacy against 9/11 backlash, hate crimes, and racial profiling in the past ten years, this bill would essentially be backstepping and “cleaning up” history. Considering this is happening in Arizona where xenophobic legislation are a dime a dozen these days, I’m not all that surprised. But I do think that Governor Jane Brewer should not sign this bill. <a href="http://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/5227/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=6592">If you think this as well, you can sign the petition hosted through SALDEF right here</a>.
