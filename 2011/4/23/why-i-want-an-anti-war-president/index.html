                                Some readers have expressed surprise that<a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/erikkain/2011/04/22/gary-johnson-the-zen-candidate/">I would potentially support</a> Gary Johnson for president. Let me first say that I don’t know what I’ll do when it comes time to pull the lever – I sincerely doubt Johnson will get the GOP nomination so it seems very unlikely at this point. But I do think that even while Johnson takes positions on economic issues and the welfare state that I disagree with, his positions on the issues I find <em>even more important</em> are sound.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The president doesn’t have <em>that much control</em> over most domestic issues, from entitlement spending to education to healthcare reform. Beyond setting the agenda, a president doesn’t really legislate. That’s up to the legislature. In other words, a President Johnson could not come into power and unilaterally end Medicare or slash retirement benefits or really do much of anything about spending or the welfare apparatus.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, a president does have broad powers over federal enforcement of drug laws and has even <em>more</em> power over our military and the decisions that effect foreign policy. This is one reason, I think, that so many presidents end up playing toy soldier and rushing our young men and women off to one war after another. Obama was able to start a war in Libya without any US input at all. All it took the Bush administration to launch a massive invasion of Iraq was a bunch of propaganda about WMD’s and the congress critters followed along eagerly, while the radio talking heads and the majority of mainstream media outlets complacently parroted one untruth after another.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In other words, if you’re president it’s really hard to enact the domestic legislation you had in mind, but it’s really easy – almost effortless – to start dropping bombs half a world away. And this is exactly why I can imagine myself supporting Gary Johnson. I don’t think he’d have much luck at all with his domestic spending agenda, except at the margins.

                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Issue-based alliances between libertarians and the political left are needed to confront the bipartisan consensus of militarism, corporatism, mass incarceration, an unaccountable executive, and the erosion of civil liberties. The odious amalgam has become the norm that, save for a radical change, will only become more entrenched.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That’s where Johnson comes in.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The left won’t be amenable to Johnson’s agenda on most fiscal and economic issues. (I also find his enthusiastic cheerleading for school vouchers and support for privatized prisons as New Mexico governor deplorable.)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But he supports limiting America’s military footprint abroad, legalizing marijuana, and halting civil-liberty curtailment.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Contrast that with Obama’s horrendous record on foreign policy, drug policy, and civil liberties. I don’t think you’d see Johnson trying Khalid Sheik Mohammed before a military commission or tacitly accepting the inhumane treatment of Bradley Manning.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And Johnson doesn’t have the paleoconservative streak of well-known libertarian congressman Ron Paul, making the former New Mexico governor more palatable to the left. (Paul endorsed Chuck Baldwin, the Constitution Party’s presidential candidate in 2008,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtxRU2QXJ8Q">saying</a> his views are “very, very close to mine.”)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Second, it would show the Obama campaign the left won’t meekly fall in line. The typical tack would be to get behind Obama because he is the “lesser of two evils.” But that would neuter the left’s sway from the get-go.
                                </p>

                                Like I said, I don’t know if I could pull the lever for Johnson. His positions on education, taxes, stimulus and a whole host of other policies run counter-current to mine. But maybe those issues are not as important to our decision on who we elect as president. School-related issues are going to be mostly based on local and state decisions. Stimulus and taxes and most other economic issues are going to be handled in congress (though the POTUS does control the veto pen, and Johnson is certainly not afraid to use it.) Would I trade all that for an end to these wars? For an end to the brutally violent class war we call the War on Drugs? To a reduction in the hundreds of billions of dollars we piss away on war and mass imprisonment. I think I would. One Johnson term devoted to curtailing all this warfare could change the course of history, and we desperately need that change.
