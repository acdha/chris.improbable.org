                                Apparently Paul Ryan’s budget was <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/budget/154591-conservative-bloc-unveils-alternative-budget-with-91t-in-cuts">too squishy for House Republicans</a>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Whereas Ryan’s plan would balance the federal budget by 2040, the RSC plan would do so by 2020.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It does so by cutting $3.3 trillion more over 10 years than the Ryan plan. The Ryan budget resolution cuts $5.8 trillion over the next decade, while the RSC plan would cut $9.1 trillion.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “The Path to Prosperity put forward by the House Budget Committee takes an honest look at the challenges ahead and, if implemented, would give Americans a better future than the one toward which the country is currently headed. Toward that end, the RSC proposes this budget that builds off the Budget Committee’s effort and balances the budget by 2020,” the plan states.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    One trillion dollars in additional cuts would come from discretionary accounts such as agency budgets, and another $1.2 trillion would be slashed from Medicare. Another $700 billion would be cut from Medicaid.
                                </p>

                                I could be mistaken, but if I recall correctly Republicans campaigned against the Democratic healthcare reform law by lamenting cuts to Medicare. I mean, that’s just my admittedly foggy memory talking. I’m probably totally wrong about this. Why would Republicans try to protect Medicare from moderate cuts in the Democrats healthcare legislation and then slash many trillions from the program the next year? I mean that just doesn’t make any sense…

                                    Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) authored an entire op-ed decrying the cuts in <em>The Journal Times</em>, warning they would "dramatically increase premiums for seniors or simply kill Medicare Advantage outright." Speaker John Boehner warned of<a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2009/11/boehner-misrepresents-factcheckorgs-findings/">"massive cuts to Medicare benefits"</a> in press releases.
