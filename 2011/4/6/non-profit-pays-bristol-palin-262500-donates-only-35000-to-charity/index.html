                                Bristol Palin has learned a great deal from her mother, Sarah Palin. The most valuable lesson is how to milk her celebrity status for all its worth. Whereas Palin the elder has made a fortune on book deals, Fox News, and expensive speaking engagements, Bristol Palin has made her first few hundred thousand working to prevent teenage pregnancy. Unfortunately for teen moms, however, Ms. Palin <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2011/04/05/bristol-palin-profiteer-teen-pregnancy/">decided to keep most of her non-profit’s funds for herself</a>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    In 2009, Sarah Palin’s daughter Bristol <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/05/bristol-palin-candies-fou_n_196838.html">joined</a> a teen pregnancy prevention nonprofit called the Candie’s Foundation. Today, the Associated Press <a href="http://www.ktiv.com/Global/story.asp?S=14387535">reported</a> that the Candie’s Foundation released its 2009 tax information, revealing that Bristol was paid a salary of $262,500.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But a closer examination of the <a href="http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2010/134/165/2010-134165184-06b511df-9.pdf">tax form</a> by ThinkProgress shows that the group disbursed only $35,000 in grants to actual teen pregnancy health and counseling clinics: $25,000 to the Mt. Sinai Adolescent Health Center and $10,000 to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy.
                                </p>

                                I knew there was a lot of money to be made in the non-profit industry, but I didn’t know anyone would so blatantly abuse their position at a supposed charity. For every dollar Bristol gave to the cause, she gave $7.50 to herself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Her charity, the Candie’s Foundation, also spent $165,000 on advertising. That’s another $4.71 for every dollar given to charity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is something not enough people consider when they give money to charitable causes. Where does it go? How much of it is funneled off into the pockets of advertising agencies or celebrities like Palin?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the charter school world there are many similar problems. A lot of charity and foundation money go into these schools, but there isn’t a lot of oversight for many of them, and it’s not uncommon for directors of charter schools to rake in six figure salaries.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We should encourage charities and charitable investments, but we should hold these programs accountable. If I had donated to the Candie’s Foundation, I would not have expected my money to go mostly to paying for Palin’s wardrobe. Likewise, I would not expect charter schools to use their money to line the pockets of overpaid school directors. But it happens all the time.
