                                This week, NASA released the first images that its Messenger probe sent back after it went into orbit around the solar system's innermost planet, Mercury. These weren't the first images taken of Mercury from a spacecraft, nor even the first images of Mercury taken by Messenger, which had passed by the planet several times as it maneuvered into orbit. So why is entering orbit a big deal?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In some ways, going into orbit means we're there to learn instead of simply discover. We picked up remarkable things as the Voyagers shot past the outer planets in our solar system, but the rapid flybys tended to provide a limited, static image of the planets they visited. When we returned with later orbiters, we got to track things like changing seasons on the planets and their moons, the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/03/jupiter-and-saturns-rings-show-echoes-of-comet-collisions.ars">evolution of their rings</a>, and changes in their atmospheres. If one pass yields something interesting, it's possible to go back around and have another look.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, in celebration of Messenger's achievement, we're going to take a look back at a series of firsts, with some of the initial photos taken from orbit (or a variation on that theme) for all of the planets. Dwarf planets need not apply.

                                On March 29, after several flybys, <a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/the_mission/index.html">Messenger</a> achieved orbit of the planet Mercury, the closest to the Sun. To protect its payload from the Sun, the probe features a sun shield and insulation, along with internal heat pipes and radiators—even the solar panels need mirrors to keep from overheating. In addition to imaging cameras, the probe carries three spectrometers and a variety of instruments to detect charged particles and magnetic fields. The goal is to get a sense of the planet's geological history, along with its current composition.

                                The Venera 9 mission was part of an aggressive exploration of Venus performed in the mid-1970s by the Soviet Union. It was launched from the Baikonor Cosmodrome in 1975, and part of the mission became the first human hardware to orbit the planet. But on October 22, <a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1975-050D">the other part actually landed on the planet</a>, taking the picture shown below and transmitting data for nearly an hour. In addition to showing the planet's rocky surface, Venera 9 gave us the first direct measurement of the planet's high temperatures, thick clouds, and rather aggressive atmospheric chemicals.

                                Oddly, although the orbiter had a large array of instruments that included cameras, I've been unable to find photos taken from orbit. Based on our experience with Mars, however, the combination of orbital imaging and on-ground exploration provide a more complete picture of the rocky planets, so it seems reasonable to commemorate the landing on Venus.

                                For our home planet, we're going to do the converse: commemorate the first picture of it taken from outside the Earth's orbit. In December of 1968, as part of the preparations for the first landing on the Moon, Apollo 8 left Earth's orbit, eventually taking the first photos of an earthrise while orbiting the Moon. So much has been written about how the images taken during that mission changed the way we perceive our planet that anything anything I write would be redundant. Besides, the image speaks for itself.

                                The Mariner series of probes encompassed a diverse set of hardware that performed flybys of all of the solar system's inner planets. Mariner 8 and 9 were the last of the series, and the first intended to go into orbit around another planet, in this case Mars. Mariner 8's launch vehicle failed to clear the atmosphere, leaving <a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1971-051A">Mariner 9</a> as the first craft to enter an orbit around the red planet, which it did in November of 1971. The solar powered craft operated for about a year.

                                Finding the first pictures from orbit is actually very hard due to a quirk of history. As Mariner 9 arrived, a giant dust storm developed, which eventually obscured the entire planet, with only the highest volcanoes peeking above it. Actual mapping imagery didn't begin until December. This image appears to have been taken shortly before the craft entered orbit, and the succeeding one came some indeterminate time afterwards.

                                Galileo entered orbit around Jupiter on December 7, 1995, where it stayed until it was sent into the planet to burn up in 2003, with the intent of avoiding contamination of any of the moons, some of which are suspected of being capable of supporting life. As the <a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galileo/">probe's homepage</a> depicts, the craft suffered from a malfunctioning main antenna which didn't completely unfurl in space. Nevertheless, backup hardware allowed it to send the first images of the solar system's biggest planet from orbit, and relayed years of data on the gas giant and its moons.

                                The Jet Propulsion laboratory organizes images by orbit, and the <a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galileo/gallery/jupiter-orbit1.cfm">images from the first orbit</a> focus on the planet's Great Red Spot. The one below was taken on the first orbit (from June 1996), and uses multiple exposures to create a true-color image of the planet's upper atmosphere.

                                Cassini is the only other planetary orbiter on the list that's still in operation. It arrived at Saturn in July of 2004 and, later that year, delivered a lander, Huygens, to the moon Titan. It has operated so well that its initial four-year mission has now been extended out to 2017—over 13 years of operation. It has already sent staggering amounts of data on the two-hour-plus trip to Earth, making the planet, its rings, and its moons one of the best studied planetary systems (the Earth and Mars probably come out ahead).

                            <p>
                                Cassini's <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/index.cfm">website</a> makes it relatively easy to identify the first images taken from orbit, since it has a <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/raw/">search function</a> that will bring up a raw image based on target and date. Starting with the day of the orbiter's arrival and setting the target to Saturn, we came up with the stunning image below.

                                A grand total of one spacecraft has ever visited the ice giants of our outer solar system, and Voyager 2 did not stop to orbit. As Ars author Kunio Sayanagi <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/03/planetary-exploration-2013-2022-scientists-are-ready-what-about-you.ars">recently pointed out</a>, however, it's beginning to look like ice giants are the most common type of exoplanet that we're discovering, so anything we can learn about the ones close by will provide insight into the galaxy as a whole. Unfortunately, NASA's budget woes make it unlikely we'll get a look from orbit any time soon. In the meantime, you can enjoy the photos taken by Voyager 2.

                                <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/">Voyager 2</a>, now on the verge of exiting the solar system, flew past Uranus in January 1986, just over 25 years ago now (as if some of us needed another reason to feel old). It brought the total number of known moons orbiting the planet up to 15, and provided images of them and the planet's rings. The planet's atmosphere itself is largely featureless, so images made the planet appear like a faint blue billiard ball.

                                Voyager 2 later <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/neptune.html">skimmed past Neptune's north pole</a> in 1989, 12 years after it left Earth. As the first craft to visit the furthest planet in the solar system, nearly everything it found was new. Unlike Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has clear features, driven by intense winds, and includes a Great Dark Spot, visible in the center of the picture below. Currently, there are no concrete plans in place to send a mission to this planet, although the concept has been considered by NASA and the ESA.
