                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Dear Hollywood:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I get it. Those of you who control the purse-strings: You say you’re only interested in the color green, but your behavior doesn’t bear that out. I know you’re really only interested in stories of straight white men doing straight white mannish things, whatever those might be. I get that <a href="http://thehathorlegacy.com/why-film-schools-teach-screenwriters-not-to-pass-the-bechdel-test/">the voices of women grate upon you like a rasp over nutmeg</a> and <a href="http://fadeinonline.com/articles/minority-report/">you’re not really interested in desegregating racially either.</a> Seriously, there’s no need for you to justify yourself or try to explain that <em>you’re</em> not bigoted, it’s just <em>the audience</em> that you’re concerned about… because frankly, it’s not what you say that matters, here. It’s what you do. And you have been doing so much that’s just… wtf.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But I have a question. How’s that whole bigotry thing working out for you? Financially, I mean.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                ‘Cause, y’know, from where I’m sitting, it doesn’t look like this strategy has been especially effective lately. Last year, one of your biggest flops was a beloved children’s TV show that in its original form was chock full of brown people — <a href="http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/film_salon/2010/04/05/last_airbender_shyamalan_racism_open2010">which you whitewashed.</a> People are still making fun of the monstrosity that resulted. This weekend past, your “female empowerment action fantasy” <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-wimpy-kid-sequel-beat-171926">got the crap beaten out of it by a wimpy kid</a>, in part because <a href="http://cassiealexander.com/2011/03/suckerpunch-ed/">it wasn’t empowering at all,</a> and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2011/03/sucker-punch-and-the-decline-of-strong-woman-action-heroines/73090/">was actually pretty damn misogynistic.</a> Wow, not even your usual demographic, the straight white guys you’re trying so hard to appeal to, <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sucker-punch-2010/">liked that one.</a> And I’m already seeing storm warnings on the horizon re <a href="http://www.racebending.com/v4/featured/jennifer-lawrence-cast-as-katniss-in-the-hunger-games/">a few new projects</a> <a href="http://movies.ign.com/articles/115/1156981p1.html">coming down the pipe.</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What kills me is that so many of these things are adaptations of other properties that were successful in their original forms. Brown people, strong women, and all. I take it you’re buying these properties, and turning them into films, <em>because</em> of their preexisting success and built-in audience — so why then turn around and piss off that audience? Disrespecting them pretty much ruins all the free publicity they would’ve given you — or rather, you’ll still get it, but it will contain lots of teeth-gnashing rage. And calls for boycotts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Look, I know old habits are hard to break. I know you’ve been doing this for decades, and it’s worked for you sometimes. But <a href="http://thehathorlegacy.com/women-buy-55-of-movie-tickets/">women buy 55% of movie tickets</a> these days. And people of color are 40% — and growing — of your potential audience. Your most successful films have been those that <em>broke</em> these old habits, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/">appealed equally to all comers</a>. You don’t actually have to change that much to fix this problem — <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/">you can still put white guys front and center if you really want to</a>. All you have to do is insert a smart woman or two, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0913822/">this guy</a>, and that will make the movie perfect. (Okay, sorry, I’m a Watanabe fan. Some other brown people would be nice, too.) That’ll do — as a stopgap measure, anyway.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Until you’re ready to put people who look and act like your audience front and center. Which <a href="http://www.8asians.com/2010/06/25/racebending-releases-report-on-the-true-diversity-in-paramount-pictures-films/">you aren’t doing.</a> (86% of lead roles go to white males? I mean, come on.) Which you really should be doing <em>now.</em> See, if you really did care about green, this is a choice you would’ve made ages ago. Which is more lucrative, selling something to a small demographic set, or selling something that everyone can enjoy? Other parts of the world figured this out long ago — contrary to what the US comics industry thinks, <a href="http://www.tokyopop.com/corporate/booksellers/882">women frickin’ love comic books</a> <a href="http://www.unheardtaunts.com/wir/women.html">when those books treat them like people and not objects of lust and manpain.</a> <a href="http://www.nomorelost.org/2011/03/25/straight-male-gamer-told-to-get-over-it-by-bioware/">Other industries are figuring this out too</a> — so what’s wrong with <em>you</em>? Why are <em>you</em> sleeping on the job?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And when are you finally, <strong>finally</strong> going to wake the hell up?
                            </p>
