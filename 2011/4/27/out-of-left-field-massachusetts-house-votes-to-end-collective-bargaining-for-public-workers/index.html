                                In a surprise move yesterday, House lawmakers in Massachusetts <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/04/27/house_votes_to_limit_bargaining_on_health_care/?p1=News_links">voted overwhelmingly to strip public workers of their collective bargaining rights</a> over healthcare decisions. The move would strip police officers, teachers, and other municipal workers of their bargaining rights over changes made to healthcare benefits, including premiums, co-payments and other benefits.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The really surprising thing is that Massachusetts is a deep-blue state, and the House is controlled by Democrats. Far from the Tea Party governments of Wisconsin and elsewhere, Massachusetts has one of the most progressive healthcare systems in the country, thanks to former governor Mitt Romney.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even so, the House voted 11-to-42 to strip healthcare bargaining from public workers. The move was spearheaded by Democratic House Speaker Robert A DeLeo who claimed it would save cities and the state millions of dollars.

                                Massachusetts AFL-CIO President Robert J Hanyes <a href="http://blog.aflcio.org/2011/04/27/mass-house-votes-to-end-workers-health-care-bargaining-rights/">responded</a>, saying:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    It is inconceivable to me that the power of the Massachusetts Speaker is such that duly elected State Representatives would choose to take away peoples’ rights instead of stand up to one person’s will. Here in the cradle of liberty, the first state with child labor laws, and such a rich tradition of supporting working families, 111 representatives voted to take away collective bargaining rights because the Speaker of the House made them.
                                </p>

                                Under the new legislation, public employees will have 30 days to hammer out any changes to their health benefits. If an agreement is not reached in that time frame, government officials can unilaterally impose those changes. This provides government officials with very little incentive to bargain.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have to admit, this endless assault on middle-class benefits and wages across the country, in both the public and private sector, makes it more obvious than ever that on top of a revival of unionism and the repeal of anti-union legislation, it’s time to move toward a guaranteed system of healthcare benefits for all. In other words, single-payer. Benefits are too easily taken away if they’re given out piecemeal. When even Democratic legislatures are voting to strip employees of their rights, it’s time for a change.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Update.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In an email, a spokesman for DeLeo writes:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    I saw your item on the municipal healthcare reform, which, while largely thoughtful left out three major points that I might think be helpful. While the legislation passed in the MA House last night does make some changes to the way municipal workers receive their healthcare, it retains collective bargaining for  premium splits – usually the costliest outlay of funds for most workers – and leaves untouched all other bargaining rights. It further leaves the actual change up to the individual municipalities: this is called a “local option” in Massachusetts parlance. Cities and towns must elect to embrace plan design. Finally, and perhaps most relevant to your point, the most these workers will have to pay is what state public workers pay as being part of the Group Insurance Commission. In other words, all state public employees – unionized or otherwise – are part of a generous healthcare plan referred to as the GIC. This change simply ensures that during these difficult fiscal times cities and towns don’t have to pay for more generous benefits than the state provides to its employees.

                                More on this <a href="http://thephoenix.com/boston/news/119769-dont-shortchange-the-arts/#ixzz1KlRxjh33">here</a>. I’ll have to do more research, but this certainly doesn’t appear to be on the same scale as the draconian attack on worker’s rights we saw in Wisconsin recently. Still, maybe Massachusetts should think about ditching Romneycare and following <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/erikkain/2011/04/26/vermont-moves-toward-single-payer-healthcare/">Vermont’s lead toward single-payer</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://articles.boston.com/2011-01-22/news/29345908_1_public-employee-unions-labor-unions-health-care">This article</a> shines a little more light on all of this. Basically, the legislation allows municipalities and school districts to bypass unions more easily in joining the state healthcare plan. The state plan is larger and thus better at controlling rising healthcare costs. Larger insurance pools are typically better at reining in spending, so this makes a lot of sense from a financial standpoint (also – single-payer would create a <em>really</em> big risk pool so that’s something to consider). I fully support worker’s rights to collectively bargain, but stubbornly refusing to join the state plan makes little sense from a long-term fiscal standpoint. Unions need to think long-term if they want to remain relevant and retain public support.
