                            In the late 1800’s there were more than twenty breweries operating in DC, the largest of which was Christian Heurich Brewing Company&nbsp;Heurich. Christian&nbsp;Heurich brewed beer on the site of the Kennedy Center for 83 years, survived prohibition and by the mid fifties
                            <p>
                                <img title="3stars" src="http://eatmoredrinkmore.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/3stars.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="144">
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                outlasted every other local brewery in the struggle against the rise of post-war rise of mega-breweries. In 1956, Christian&nbsp;Heaurich could no longer compete against the likes of Anheuser Busch and was forced to close their doors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thankfully in recent decades the nation’s taste has shifted away from the uniform blandness of the mega-brewed beerthat once put poor Olde Heurich out of business and has moved towards more flavorful and complex craft-like brewers such as Sam Adams and Sierra Nevada. This shift has led to the resurgence of the microbrewery which has been grabbing an increasing (albeit still very small) percentage of the beer market.
                            </p>
                            <p>

The DC beer scene has come a long way in recent years, we have some great brewpubs like Capitol City and Gordon Biersch and some first class beer bars like Church Key and Brasserie Beck. Heck even the check cashing/ liquor store by my apartment on 11<sup>th</sup> and M recently expanded to include 4 refrigerator units for craft beer. But for whatever reason in the 55 years since Olde Heurich stopped production Washington DC has remained brewery-less….. until now.

                                Three breweries are set to begin producing beer from within the District this summer. <a href="http://www.dcbrau.com/">DC Brau,</a> <a href="http://www.3starsbrewing.com/">3 Stars</a> and <a href="http://chocolatecitybeer.com/">Chocolate City</a> will all be brewing with a focus on the local DMV market. You can already find DC Brau at select bars throughout the area. Last week I tried their ‘Public’ pale ale at Church Key. Public is a crisp, refreshing&nbsp;&nbsp;and hoppy brew made from American hops and is an excellent ambassador for the DC beer scene.

                                Chocolate City’s Big Chair IPA is scheduled to hit DC bars later this summer. Ben Matz of <a href="http://chocolatecitybeer.com/">Chocolate City Beer</a> is eager to fill the microbrew vacuum that has developed in the District over the past half century, “I’ve noticed that as more of my neighbors are interested in small-producer craft beers, they are more interested in the local economy, local and sustainably raised food, and generally there comes a head scratching moment where people look around and ask ‘why don’t we have a brewery?’.”

                                <a href="http://www.portcitybrewing.com"></a> is very excited about the potential of the DC beer market “We have a 30 barrel system and it is running at full capacity after only three months of operation. I tell everyone that a market the size of DC should have 5 or 6 breweries of our size, not just one.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The process of bring beer back to DC has been difficult for the three upstart breweries. Because there has not been a brewery in DC since the Eisenhower administration, DC permit and zoning officials were not informed or prepared to support the opening of a commercial brewery. The brewers have had to educate DC officials about what a brewery is and what a brewery is not as they went through city processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Matz has had dozens of educational conversations similar to ‘There is no hood over our oven in the plans because a brewery does not have ovens.’
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Microbrews in other states, like Port City, are allowed to hold tastings and sell their product on site. No such laws exist in the District, so DC Brau has been leading the effort to change local law with the introduction of The Brewery Manufacturer’s Tasting Permit Amendment Act of 2011 which will allow DC brewers to serve beer on site. Also because of DC’s zoning laws, Chocolate City and DC Brau had to set up shop in difficult to access Ward 5, which could impact the number of visitors they receive once the legislation is passed. In addition to all of the paperwork issues the brewers still faced the difficulties of finding good brewing equipment, sourcing quality ingredients, fine tuning their recipes, and actually brewing beer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The future of the DC beer scene is very promising. The Brewers Association will hold the 2013 Craft Brewers Conference in DC. Bill Butcher sees it as an “opportunity for us to show the craft beer world that DC belongs on the list of great beer cities in the U.S.” Ben Mentz agrees “all in all, we as a city are taking a huge step forward, I can’t wait to begin building DC’s beer scene and raising her craft brewing flag.”
