                            Is there a level of GOP which is comfortable with numbers?
                        </p>

                                <p>
                                    A couple of news articles are out about the Arlington GOP's <a href="http://www.thewashcycle.com/2011/04/arlington-gop-opposes-capital-bikeshare.html">misguided stance against Capital Bikeshare</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Part of their opposition is that the parking removal <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/local/virginia/2011/04/arlington-gop-criticizes-board-bike-sharing">could hurt businesses</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                    "Parking throughout the [Rosslyn-Ballston] corridor is particularly tight," said Jeffrey Miller, a spokesman for the Arlington County Republican Committee. "It's very difficult when you have business for there to be enough daily parking."
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Which might have some validity if the local business community saw it the same way. But, they don't.
                                </p>
                                <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                    Rosslyn Business Improvement District Executive Director Cecilia Cassidy said the organization supports the Bikeshare stations.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So the ACRC supports is so pro-business that they support them even when they don't know what's good for them - "You'll get more parking, and you'll like it!" In the same article, the ACRC blames the county board for the site selection. I'm pretty sure the board isn't micro-managing any project to that level of detail, and if they are, that is bad.
                                </p>
                                <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                    "When we do take up motor vehicle space and re-purpose it for bike-sharing, the space is likely receiving more use than it was previously by a motor vehicle trip, which are usually done by a single-occupant vehicle," said Paul DeMaio, the county's bike-share consultant.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A second article in the <a href="http://www.sungazette.net/articles/2011/04/26/arlington/news/nw80n1.txt">Sun Gazette</a> bites on the "percentage of bikes in use at one time" hook.
                                </p>
                                <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                    On a recent rainy Friday, about 5 percent of the total bikes available in Arlington and D.C. were in use, while on a sunny Thursday afternoon, about 15 percent were on the road.
                                </p>
                                <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                    “You would think peak usage would be at least around 50 percent,” said Jeffrey Miller, a former chairman of the Arlington County Republican Committee.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    OK, so this just comes from a place of pure ignorance. To have 50 percent of bikes in use, demand would have to be insane, people would almost need to line up at stations waiting for the next bike to come in. If you think about it, each time a bike is checked out it decreases the likelihood that a potential customer and a remaining bike will be correctly paired up.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And not to sound like a broken record, but this thing is still fresh out of the box. Membership and usage are still climbing. It's not unlikely that these numbers will go up.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Is there a time when 50% of cars are being used? Or even 50% of bus or transit capacity? Consider that there are often cars or buses that aren't in service and always ones that are heading in the opposite direction of rush hour traffic.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Chris Eatough, project manager for Bike Arlington, makes some excellent points as well.
                                </p>
                                <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                    Eatough says the figures on the Web site aren’t always 100-percent accurate, but acknowledged it’s an “interesting and pretty fun” way to track usage.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Eatough said ridership has routinely been at 20 percent of available bikes, a figure he termed “very high” compared to similar initiatives around the globe. In the D.C. area, it has on rare occasions gone as high as 50 percent, which is considered “off the charts,” he said.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    But he doesn’t think that’s the best way to gauge how well the system is performing. He asks the public to compare the bicycle inventory to books on the shelves of libraries, saying you can’t expect everything to be checked out at one time.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Eatough prefers to use the trips-per-bike-per-day number to compare systems. By that measure, the local effort is gaining on Paris and Montreal, two more established systems, which are averaging three trips per bicycle per day.
                                </p>

                                    Miller isn't done though.
                                </p>
                                <p style="padding-left:30px">
                                    “I’m not sure there’s not a theoretical benefit [to the program]. There is some small convenience factor,” Miller said. “The question is, how much should we as taxpayers be subsidizing"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    That's an excellent question. One he fails to answer.
                                </p>

                                    Do you own your own train? Do you own your own bus? I really think he has spent zero time thinking about what this program is or what it is for.
