                                If a police officer stops you in the course of investigating some matter, can she peruse the contents of your mobile device as she might demand your identification or the contents of the glove compartment of your vehicle? Does a routine traffic stop allow access to your phone's photos, videos, text messages, and contacts?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The gear to grab this data is widely available. Cell phone extraction hardware made by CelleBrite, for instance, can grab a phone's contacts database, its text message log, call history, pictures, videos, ringtones, or even a "complete file system memory dump." The Michigan State Police is a CelleBrite customer, and its routine use is raising questions about the propriety of law enforcement accessing data stored on cell phones.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan worries about how the state police have been using their gadgets, saying that CelleBrite gear can "quickly download data from cell phones without the owner of the cell phone knowing it." They want to know how, when, and where the cops are doing these searches.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After requesting the information using 70 Freedom of Information Act filings, the ACLU was told that documents in question were voluminous. They would include the department's records, logs, and reports of its actual use of these devices. According to the ACLU's <a href="http://www.aclumich.org/sites/default/files/CellebriteLettertoMSP.pdf">latest letter</a> to the MSP, the police estimated that a Freedom of Information Act data retrieval would cost over half a million dollars.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "In fact, we were told that no part of that set of documents would be provided unless we agreed to pay a $272,340 deposit," the ACLU said in a public complaint letter.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Law enforcement officers are known, on occasion, to encourage citizens to cooperate if they have nothing to hide," the letter concludes. "No less should be expected of law enforcement, and the Michigan State Police should be willing to assuage concerns that these powerful extraction devices are being used illegally by honoring our requests for cooperation and disclosure."

                                The CelleBrite company makes many of these phone forensics devices. CelleBrite's <a href="http://www.cellebrite.com/images/stories/brochures/Company%20Profile%20ENGLISH.pdf">profile</a> boasts that the company "introduced a mobile data extraction solution for mobile forensic investigations" in 2007; since then, its products have been used by the military, police, and intelligence agencies around the globe.

It knows how to extract data like a phonebook, camera pictures, videos, audio, SMS text messages and everything else in fairly short order, and it has a cable pack that can interface with most cell phones.

                                Once a police officer connects the gadget to a suspects' handset, the handheld displays five options:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                </li>
                                <li>Extract SIM/USIM Data: for physical extraction directly from a SIM card
                                </li>
                                <li>Clone SIM ID: allows the user to copy a SIM card, enabling the officer to analyze the phone without it being able to take incoming calls
                                </li>
                                <li>Memory dump beta (for password disabling)

                                Option one is easy. The officer connects to the phone, clicks number one, and is directed to a menu of hundreds of mobile vendors. She then picks the vendor and model through a series of drop down displays. Next the operator must tell the device to extract from the phone (as opposed to a SIM card), and whether access a USB or SD data drive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then it's time to pick the content types and extract each form of data.
                            </p>
                            <p>

This software allows the police to use specialized search fields to ferret out string patterns in a suspect's cell phone content. The technique is useful in locating certain kinds of file types. For example, JPEG images start with HEX values FF D8 FF. And regular expression (regex) fields can identify specific SMS numbers or dates.

The UFED then instructs you to enter "0000" in the phone to complete the pairing between the devices. Once doing this, all data transfer between the UFED and the phone will be performed using Bluetooth.

The Videos icon shows a thumbnail of each video. The officer can also use the UFED to extract all data to a PC for a later, complete analysis of the content.

                                Watchdog concern with these kinds of searches has been heightened by high-profile court cases. And warrants aren't necessarily needed for searches "incident to arrest."

                            <p>
                                A couple years ago, for instance, Gregory Diaz of California was arrested for trying to sell the drug ecstasy to a police informant. He had his phone confiscated when he arrived at the station. The cops helped themselves to Diaz's text message folder and discovered the digits "6 4 80" in one file (forensic translation: six pills for $80).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Diaz's attorneys contended that this search, done without a warrant, ran afoul of the Fourth Amendment. The court disagreed, ruling that whatever was found on his person during the arrest was "fair game in terms of being evidence of a crime."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When the matter reached the California Supreme Court, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/06/govt-workers-fourth-amendment-wont-protect-your-sexy-texts.ars">it concurred with this logic</a>. Just as a defendants' cigarette cases, clothing, and vehicle trunks are fair game at the time of an arrest, so are cell phones. The device was "immediately associated" with Diaz's person, and therefore the warrantless search was valid, the California Supreme Court opined in January.

                                "May the police search the iPhone's call history, cell phone contacts, e-mails, pictures, movies, calendar entries and, perhaps most significantly, the browsing history from recent Internet use?" asked <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1084503">Houston law professor</a> Adam Gershowitz back in 2008. "Under longstanding Supreme Court precedent decided well before handheld technology was even contemplated, the answer appears to be yes."

                                    If you're arrested while carrying a mobile phone on your person, police are free to rifle through your text messages, images, and any other files stored locally on your phone. Any incriminating evidence found on your phone can be used against you in court.

                                    On the other hand, if you are arrested with a mobile phone in your possession but not immediately associated with your person, police may not search your phone without a warrant once you've been taken into custody and your phone is under police control.

                            <p>
                                Last Wednesday, in response to the ACLU, the Michigan State Police department issued a press release. It insisted that its officers only help themselves to cell phone content via data extraction devices (DEDs) if they have a warrant.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "The department's internal directive is that the DEDs only be used by MSP specialty teams on criminal cases, such as crimes against children," <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/msp/0,1607,7-123-1586-254783--,00.html">Michigan says</a>. They're not being used to siphon personal data "during routine traffic stops."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It added that "the implication by the ACLU that the MSP uses these devices 'quietly to bypass Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches' is untrue, and this divisive tactic unjustly harms police and community relations."

                                The ACLU is unimpressed with these claims. "We think it's wonderful that the Michigan State Police department says this, but basically nothing's changed," a spokesperson for the civil liberties group told us on Friday. "Cough up the documents and let us verify that. We'd love to take them at their word, but we wouldn't being doing our duty as a watchdog organization."

                            <p>
                                The back-and-forth in Michigan plays out as people become increasingly aware of the sheer amount of data stored on their phones. Last week brought us some controversy over the way that Apple's iPhone <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/04/how-apple-tracks-your-location-without-your-consent-and-why-it-matters.ars">logs detailed cell phone triangulation data</a>—and has since Apple released its iOS 4 last summer. On Wednesday Senator Al Franken (D-MN) sent a letter to Apple asking for details about the file.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Anyone who gains access to this single file could likely determine the location of the user's home, the businesses he frequents, the doctors he visits, the schools his children attend, and the trips he has taken over the past months or even a year," Franken wrote.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But mobile forensics expert Steven Whalen pointed out the irony of this controversy, given the larger implications of UFED devices like that from CelleBrite.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "I find it kind of silly that he is worried about one single file when the entire device contains information that can be easily extracted by anyone with some training or basic research," Whalen told me. "That is why Apple gives you the option to encrypt, lock or wipe the device."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whalen runs the <a href="http://www.sumuri.com/">Sumuri company</a>, which offers Cellebrite certification and forensic training. He noted that retail versions of these UFEDs are often sold at cell phone stores.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "If I had a choice between doing forensics on a computer or a cellphone, I'd choose the cell phone," he told us. "All those apps are using the geo-tagging technology, especially with advertising. Unlike a PC, a person keeps their cell phone with them all the time."
