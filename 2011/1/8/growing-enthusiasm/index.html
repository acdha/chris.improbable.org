                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                I reckon every office has That Guy‡.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I mean the contagious enthusiast; you know the type. He talks about his underwater basketweaving by the coffee machine, and the next thing you know you're looking at online wicker suppliers and wondering if your bathtub's the right shape. One of them can turn an entire office into a herd of rock climbers, or single malt whisky drinkers, or Proust fans.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My team's incarnation of That Guy is into sprouting. He has special stacking boxes for keeping the sprouts from sitting in the water and going sour. He gets his seeds from a particular shop in England. He not only has all of the books on sprouting, but holds considered opinions on which ones are particularly good.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So one morning a couple of months ago, he was telling me about his sprouting while I was making my tea, and I mentioned that my parents used to grow bean and alfalfa sprouts. To the contagious enthusiast, this sort of bridge-building small talk is the equivalent of an engraved invitation. Unsurprisingly, I found his spare sprouting boxes, a little tub of mixed seeds, and the best of the sprouting books† on my desk the next morning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, I strive to be both polite and truthful*, and I knew I would have to try the whole thing out in order to be able to discuss it with him afterward. So I soaked a handful of the seeds in water for the requisite 8 hours, then spread them on the trays of the sprouting box and sprayed them morning and night. Two or three days later, the box was filled with sprouts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I decided to try a couple raw while I figured out what to do next.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>OM NOM NOM</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The next thing I remember was looking at the empty sprouting box and feeling strangely...<em>healthy</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I've tweaked and fiddled with the setup since then. I returned the boxes, because they seemed to foster mold growth. And I went and found my own sources of beans that don't require me to cross the Channel, or even the IJ. But I'm now running a small farm on one of the shelves of my bindery and eating a bowl of fresh sprouts every day. It's cheap (maybe €5 a month), requires about a cubic foot of space, and provides a fresh and crunchy source of vitamin C.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So at the risk of being That Blogger, let me tell you what I do.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The beans for my sprouting mix come from the local ethnic grocery store. I buy the following in 500g bags:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Red mung beans
                                </li>
                                <li>Green mung beans
                                </li>
                                <li>Whole brown lentils
                                </li>
                                <li>Dried chickpeas
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                That Guy had more varieties of lentil in his mix, as well as sunflower seeds, but my source doesn't supply such exotica. And this assortment works for me. I store the smaller beans mixed together, but keep the chickpeas separate. Otherwise they tend to float to the top of the box.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Every couple of days, I take a handful of the small-beans mix and a handful of chickpeas and put them into a peanut butter jar. I rubber-band a piece of tulle netting over the top, then rinse the beans a couple of times with cool water. I fill the jar most of the way and let it stand for about 8 hours to soak. Then I drain the water out.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I rinse the sprouts with fresh water and let them drain every morning and evening thereafter. Between rinsings, the jars lie on their sides on one of my bindery shelves. Two or three days after that first soaking, I get to eat a bowl of sprouts and feel healthy, thrifty, virtuous and smug. When the jar is empty, I wash it and the tulle and start again.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Two jars run in staggered parallel give me around a cup of sprouts a day, which is about as much smugness as any one person should be permitted. I understand that if you leave them to drain for a bit more time, sprouts can be kept in the fridge for a few days, but I'm prone to just eating them and growing more.

                                † in addition to being very informative about the process of sprouting, it has a useful and interesting chapter on coming out as a sprouter during the dating phase of a new relationship<br>
                                * these values do come into conflict from time to time, but that's another story</small>
