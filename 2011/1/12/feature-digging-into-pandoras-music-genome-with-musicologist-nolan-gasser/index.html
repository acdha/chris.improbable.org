                            <p>
                                "It's hard to believe that it was ten years ago," Pandora radio's Chief Musicologist Nolan Gasser confided to me in a recent interview. "I was completing my doctorate in musicology at Stanford, and was at a crossroads—between going into academia, and exploring my options as an independent musician.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was in that context that Gasser, now an accomplished <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Gasser">composer, pianist, and musicologist</a>, heard that Pandora online radio founder Tim Westergren was looking for graduate students to help analyze music for a start-up music technology company.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "This was early 2000, and the words 'music' and 'technology' were just beginning to be used in the same sentence," Gasser noted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "I answered the e-mail, and soon met with Tim—who recognized that I was not only capable of becoming a music analyst, but was able to help him realize his vision: to marry the realms of music analysis and database technology, and to create what became the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Genome_Project">Music Genome Project</a>. It was Tim's brainchild to put these two worlds together, and happily I was the right guy at the right time and place, with the background to be able to actually design the thing."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Today, Gasser is recognized as the architect of the Music Genome—the extensive database of musical attributes that lets Pandora intuit from the songs and compositions you pick what other kinds of music would please your ears.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I listen to Pandora all the time, and most of the channels I've created stream classical fare. Pandora literally saved classical music broadcasting for me. Like so many lovers of Bach, Bartok, and Stravinsky, I've experienced the last two decades as a huge disappointment. Scores of commercial classical stations disappeared after the huge license sell-off that followed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which made it much easier to purchase radio outlets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even many public radio stations have let the classical tradition go. Recent figures compiled by National Public Radio <a href="http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2010/12/07/classical-jazz-and-world-music-on-public-radio-declined-by-up-to-30-over-last-decade/">indicate</a> that one in five noncommercial stations abandoned the classical format between 2001 and 2010. Quite of few of the surviving broadcasters stay afloat by sticking to lighter fare, avoiding anything too long or too adventurous (although one of my favorite public stations, <a href="http://www.kusc.org/">KUSC-FM</a>, bucks that trend).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Pandora, on the other hand, offers an endless stream of unexpected delights—symphonies, sonatas, arias, and concertos by composers with whom I'm only vaguely familiar. But I've always wanted to know exactly how the service did this, and also how the classical component of Pandora differs from its more well known storehouse of popular music.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And so I contacted Pandora, and Nolan Gasser and I had this conversation.

                                <strong>Q. Nolan, what have you been doing at Pandora over the last decade?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well, I can only tell you so much, otherwise we might have to kill you (just kidding). Being a musicologist, as well as a pianist and a composer, I'm fortunate to have had a pretty eclectic background: I'm probably most at heart a classical musician, but I've been playing and writing rock and roll and jazz since I was very young; I've always been an eclectic musical animal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The basic idea with Pandora was to see if we could approach music from almost a scientific perspective; that's why it's called the Music Genome Project, named not accidentally after the Human Genome Project.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I've always taken that metaphor very seriously: biologists have come to understand the human species by identifying all the individual genes in our genome; it's then how each individual gene is manifest or expressed that makes us who we are as individuals—as well as defines how we're related to others: most closely to those in our family, but also indirectly to people who share our same physical attributes or capabilities in sports, and so forth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That orientation was paramount to my thinking in designing the Music Genome Project. The idea was to tackle in turn each distinct "species" of music—and we naturally started with the most vibrant one in the music industry: pop and rock music. So my tack was to conceive of pop/rock as an individual musical species, and then to figure out what individual genes make up its genome.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From a musicological standpoint, we can break down the musical identity of a pop/rock song into the fundamental parameters of music analysis: melody, harmony, rhythm, form, instrumentation, sonority, lyrics, and several others. We can then break down each of these large-scale parameters into detailed and nuanced individual traits—or genes—that are manifest in some way or another in every pop/rock song.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Q. Let's begin with popular music. How does Pandora handle that?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With pop/rock music, you are really dealing with the recording as a fixed entity. When you listen to a recording of a rock song, such as "Hey Jude" by the Beatles, you're experiencing—on some level—each of the parameters I mentioned earlier, as being manifest in a fixed and very specific way.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, in the parameter of melody, for example, both the verse and the bridge (there really isn't a chorus in "Hey Jude") are what we'd call "through-composed," as opposed to being constructed with lots of short repeating figures (like, say, in "A Hard Day's Night"). The melody of "Hey Jude" also has a wide range (over an octave for both sections), compared to a more narrow-ranged song, like "Drive My Car." And there are lots of other ways in which we can define how melody functions in this song: What is the rhythmic character of the melody? What is the relationship between the melody and the lyrics? Etc., etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We then take a similar approach to evaluating the song's other parameters: its use of harmony, form, the sound of Paul McCartney's voice, the instrumentation (the use of piano, for example), and so forth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Form, in fact, is very interesting here: I mentioned how "Hey Jude" doesn't really have a chorus the way that most pop/rock songs do—and in this way it breaks from what we'd expect of a "standard" song of this species. Another big distinction is that "Hey Jude" has a very unique ending or coda. A lot of pop/rock songs have a tag or coda [literally "tail"], but very few have a coda in the way that "Hey Jude" does—where the same 4 bar phrase (the "na-na-na" line) is repeated for some 4 minutes!
                            </p>
                            <div style="width:480px;margin:0 auto;height:385px">
                                <div style="height:385px">
                                    <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCwQiIqWpRY"><img src="http://static.arstechnica.com/public/shared/images/ars-video-placeholder.jpg" alt="A video!"></a>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                So, these are just a few of the ways in which "Hey Jude" expresses the genes found in the pop/rock genome in its own unique way, and which make it similar to some songs and different from others in the same genome—which in turn can help people find or avoid songs that share those same traits.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Q. How does this relate to Pandora's mission?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The overall goal of the Music Genome Project is to connect people to music they love, including music they've never heard before. When Tim and I first sat down at Stanford in February of 2000, there was a very idealistic and moral component to our conversation: there's an inherent problem in the music industry in that the record companies can only promote so much music. And so fans were somewhat limited to whatever they were offered on the radio or in the promotional stacks of their local record stores—back in those days. That's obviously a problem, because there's so much great music! Thus, the issue we wanted to tackle was: how can people find music they love without having to go through a gatekeeper?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Of course, most people are not musicians, they're not trained in music theory and history—and so they would likely not be able to identify the things we've talked about in "Hey Jude," or other songs they like. But that's the beauty of the Music Genome Project: all of these attributes are figured out for them by our team of music analysts, and then are placed in our database; all of the genes—hundreds of individual characteristics—are put in the database, where each song, as a whole and with its individual traits, sits next to a whole bunch of other, related songs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, "Hey Jude" sits very directly next to other songs by Paul McCartney, or the Beatles, circa 1968—like those by the Rolling Stones, the Turtles, and so forth. But it also sits nearby lots of songs that have nothing to do with Paul McCartney or the Beatles or 1968—but which share similar genomic characteristics. When a Pandora listener creates a "Hey Jude" station, and it plays something by Dave Matthews or Rufus Wainwright and he or she loves it, they may not know exactly why they love it; but musically there will be a good reason: maybe the song has a similar chord progression or instrumentation or melodic construction—or an extended vocalization or coda that we talked about. And no commercial gatekeeper was needed to make the connection.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Q. How does the Genome handle classical music, as opposed to pop?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For pop music—as well as jazz, hip-hop, electronica, and world music—the experience of the music is really defined by the recording. In jazz this is especially apparent. Most recorded jazz songs are called "standards," because virtually every jazz musician knows them. So, "Bye, Bye Blackbird" has been recorded by hundreds of jazz artists. The original version is almost not important: it's how it is interpreted by Miles Davis or Frank Sinatra or Keith Jarrett—that's the experience!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When it comes to classical music, on the other hand, it's much more about the composition itself, because even though the interpretation can vary in various subtle ways from one performance to another, the actual notes and rhythms, etc. that are played or sung­ are fixed—for most of the repertoire, anyway. The nuanced difference between a recording of a Brahms symphony by [conductors] Herbert von Karajan and Leonard Bernstein are of some impact, certainly, but in a fairly subjective way—and very small compared to the kinds of distinctions that take place between one recording and another in pop/rock, jazz, etc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, the focus for the classical genome is really on the work itself. We'll want to know what the instrumentation is, what kind of melodic, harmonic, rhythmic, and formal constructs it employs; was the work originally scored for that particular instrumentation or is it a derivative work, etc. The differences between one member of this genome and another really come down to the content of the music itself, and not a particular recording.
                            </p>

                                With pop music, you're dealing with 60 years of history; almost all pop songs are tonal [in major or minor keys] and pretty simple in their harmonic construction. They're songs, as opposed to large, multi-movement works­—most of them, anyway; there are thus certain formal conventions that are used in the great majority of them. And so, the differences are more subtle, and again, based on individual recordings.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With classical, you are dealing with a thousand years of content, from Gregorian chant to a work written last Tuesday. So, the approach is geared to the big musicological parameters manifest in the score, including one that is not as important in pop music—texture: to what degree is the music contrapuntal or polyphonic, as opposed to homophonic, which is melody and accompaniment; or is it monophonic [one melody only], like Gregorian chant, etc.?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Q. So the object of the Music Genome, for both classical music and pop, is to create a database of characteristics so that listeners can be guided towards a variety of things that they like that, in a sense, they didn't necessarily know that they liked. It allows for the creation of trees of characteristics that individuals can follow.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Certainly. The beauty of Pandora is that when you hear a song, you only need to respond with "I like it" (thumbs up) or "I don't like it" (thumbs down). You don't need to go in and say, "You know, I don't really care for that type of melody" or "I think this piece has too much dissonance." The user doesn't need to know any of that. When they say that they like or don't like something, the database itself can react.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because every one of those musical parameters has been analyzed and entered into our database, there's a pattern that emerges when a user gives us feedback. If pieces with a lot of syncopation [rhythms that are placed against the beat] are given a "thumbs up" on a particular station, then the Genome "knows" to start offering more pieces that are syncopated. And suddenly the user is going to discover music that they never heard before that matches their taste. But they don't need to know why or how, because it's all grounded in these detailed acts of analysis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Q. As you were embarking on this project ten years ago, the traditional classical music radio station was in decline. Were you aware of this? Was this part of the general concern?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was certainly part of my personal cognizance and my mission as a musicologist—and as a performer and composer—to do whatever I personally could to address this crisis. Classical music needs to continually grow its audience and find younger listeners. I'm really not a doomsday believer; I have complete faith in the music itself, which will never die, but we need to do whatever we can to grow the audience.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Just as Pandora widens the array of pop music for young people, so it can with classical—and this is all the more important, because classical music can be so intimidating. Let's say that there's some 25-year-old who just heard Pachelbel's "Canon" for the first time, and who thought it was pretty—but now has no idea where to go from there. If he or she tunes into their local classical radio station, who knows what they're going to get? They could get some Scriabin—and at that point, when they've just heard Pachelbel's "Canon," Scriabin may scare them and turn them off. But if they can create a Pachelbel "Canon" station on Pandora, suddenly they're going to get to know Vivaldi, Bach, Corelli, and other composers that live in the same world as Pachelbel, and that could gradually lead them into other realms of classical music.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So it absolutely is part of our thinking that this is a great opportunity to do good things for the classical music industry and for society in general.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Q. Let's take a musical example. Speaking of Scriabin, suppose that somebody handed you his Third Piano Sonata, played by Glenn Gould. What would you do with it?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Well, first of all, I'd probably want to analyze the Vladimir Ashkenazy recording of it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Q. You're the expert. Please continue.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <div style="float:right">
                                <img src="http://static.arstechnica.com/pandora/music-notes-2.png">

                            <p>
                                Pandora has a large team of analysts, and each has to be "certified" for the genome or genomes that they're working in. With classical, all the analysts have advanced music degrees, and a lot of music theory and history training behind them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, one of our classical analysts will get up a recording of Scriabin's "Third Piano Sonata" on their computer terminal, along with the full classical genome on the same screen. He or she will then go carefully through each of the four movements individually, so that the entire sonata will likely take well over an hour to fully analyze; but that's okay, because the beauty of it is that once the work is analyzed, it's complete in our database, and we don't need to re-analyze the recording by Glenn Gould and compare it to that by Ashkenazy, for example.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There is clearly a lot of information we need to capture about this complex work in the classical genome—its scoring for piano solo, its sophisticated approach to melody, rhythm, form, harmony, and so much more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, one of the things that I had to deal with in designing the Music Genome Project was not just what the genes of each genome are, but how the genes are to be analyzed. What's critical—not just for classical, but for all genres—is that there be consistency in how an individual piece of music is analyzed, or scored, from one analyst to another. As such, I wrote a fairly extensive manual for each Genome that every analyst needs to internalize—to define both the genes themselves and what each scoring option signifies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, when the analysts approach Scriabin's use of harmony or rhythm in the "Third Piano Sonata." there are dozens of genes they'll encounter that require clear understanding: the level of diatonicism versus chromaticism [simple versus complex harmony], the use of modality or atonality, the level of dissonance—which in Scriabin is fairly common. How is rhythm employed: are there ostinati [patterns] used, heavy syncopation, complex meters, etc.?
                            </p>

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                We don't necessarily have a gene for the "Scriabin chord," his <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Mystic_chord">mystic fourth chord</a>—though I think that comes later in his career anyway. But there would be ways of semi-detecting it through the combined scoring in areas of dissonance, chromaticism, and aesthetic orientation, etc. At any rate, from the harmony genes alone, the Genome would know that this was a progressive late-Romantic work; and so it would definitely match progressive piano works by contemporaries like Rachmaninov and Ravel, and later composers like Shostakovich and Prokofiev.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The analysts have manuscript paper near them, and so they can trace the narrative progression of the work, where it can be matched to other works that take a similar approach to form and thematic development. Often, classical works require a lot of detail regarding instrumentation—which in this case is easy, since it's for solo piano only. For every musical aspect or technique that you can imagine, there are one or more genes that deal with it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One final component of the classical genome I can mention—which is very important when it comes to the listening experience—is mood. Mood can vary so greatly, and the analysts are given the ability to be very subtle in how they document and attribute mood to a piece of music. When it comes to Scriabin, the pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy himself talks about the "black soil" that is part of the Russian vocabulary; and of course there is this kind of dark, earthy quality to Scriabin's music—and the Pandora analyst will be able to document that. It will then become something that's available to the listeners, whether they know it or not.

                                <strong>Q. Do copyright rules impact Pandora's streaming of classical music differently than they impact the streaming of pop?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They do to the extent that a good portion of the classical works played on Pandora are in Public Domain, which means that we don't need to pay performance royalties to the composers or publishers of these works through such organizations as ASCAP and BMI. It's pretty complicated, but the general rule is that musical works written before 1923 are free of performance royalties, which is a separate issue from the mechanical royalties associated with the actual recording of the work—even if the music itself was written before 1923.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                [<strong>Update</strong>: Pandora contacted us after publication to say that Gasser's response here was inaccurate. The correct answer: "No, right now we treat them all the same."]

                                <strong>Q. How many genes are there for classical music?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are over 400 genes. This is not for the faint of heart.

                                <strong>Q. So you did this for a while, helped set the Music Genome up, and I take it that you're onto new projects now?</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yes, I'm involved in a lot of new projects, but I'm still involved with the company, as the Chief Musicologist—though not on a daily basis. I naturally have a great interest in how things are going, and I meet with Tim regularly. I get involved on a project-by-project basis, when there is some need to revisit some aspect of the Genome.

                                One thing that I've done a number of times is to give Pandora-style pre-concert lectures for classical concerts. The next one I'm doing is in Kansas City, for the Friends of Chamber Music series—specifically for a concert of the early music vocal group, Sequentia, on January 21. These things are always very fun!
