                                My son was badly hurt in a Met kettle. Tomorrow we must protect students from police violence
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.coalitionofresistance.org.uk/2011/01/student-protests-in-london-and-manchester-29-january/" title="">Major student protests</a> are planned tomorrow in Manchester and London and already police are warning that they plan to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jan/27/hugh-orde-police-protest-tactics?" title="">increase the severity of their tactics</a>. I was at two of the protests at the end of last year, and the change in tactics was striking. Whereas on the 10 November demonstration no one was hurt, on 9 December there were large numbers of protester casualties – and a smaller but still significant number of less severe police injuries. The casualties seemed to be a direct result of the change in police tactics. If these now become even more extreme, there will no doubt be more violence and more people hurt. On the 9 December protest <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/10/student-operation-tuition-fees-protest" title="Guardian: Student protester operated on after being 'hit with police baton'">my son, Alfie Meadows, received life-threatening injuries</a> in an incident that is now the subject of an <a href="http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/Pages/default.aspx" title="Independent Police Complaints Commission">Independent Police Complaints Commission</a> investigation. He would have died but for the care he received from NHS nurses, ambulance workers and a fine neurosurgeon.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Despite what happened in December, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jan/27/hugh-orde-police-protest-tactics" title="Guardian: Police could use more extreme tactics on protesters, Sir Hugh Orde warns">Sir Hugh Orde still defends "kettling"</a> . But make no mistake: this police tactic puts the lives of protesters at risk. As people in the crowd – held indiscriminately against their will – are compressed, they risk being squashed. If they do not move back into a solid plug of people because they cannot do so, they risk being hit by police.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After the December protest some claimed that only the aggressive or the violent would choose to stand at the front of the "kettle" facing the cordon of riot police. That was where I and my two sons were standing, although not all at the same place. Why? Because at the end of a long day we hoped to be allowed home. The Metropolitan police had announced (as I could read on my internet-enabled phone) that "clearly nonviolent protesters" would be allowed out. On the ground, however, different rules applied. We were held with a diverse group of clearly nonviolent and sometimes very frightened people. Such tactics cannot be "for the greater good", as is claimed by the police.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Despite a slew of adverse news stories (from randy undercover policemen to a failure to investigate tabloid phone-hacking), the Met are sticking to their account of "student violence". With perfect timing in the run up to new protests, news has broken of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/27/charlie-gilmour-charged-student-protests" title="">charges against seven students. The presence of an eye-catching "son of Pink Floyd guitarist"</a> complete with a "stolen mannequin leg" exceeds a PR department's wildest dreams. Headlines are assured. But justice is intertwined with PR in this process. History is up for grabs, and the government that quickly labelled the protests "feral" now looks to images of "student violence" to justify its stance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I hope that no one will be hurt on Saturday. But I am certain that I must be there and I hope that as many parents as possible will join me. We have told our children to work hard, go to school and try for university. Now we also need to support them, to protect them and to stand witness. We need to add our voices to those whose livelihoods, health and rights are being put needlessly at risk by reckless and ideological interventions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The children's writer, Philip Pullman, put it well in a recent <a href="http://falseeconomy.org.uk/blog/save-oxfordshire-libraries-speech-philip-pullman#" title="False Economy: Leave the libraries alone. You don't understand their value">speech on the closing of local libraries</a>: "I think that little by little we're waking up to the truth about the market fanatics and their creed. We're coming to see that old Karl Marx had his finger on the heart of the matter when he pointed out that the market in the end will destroy everything we know, everything we thought was safe and solid. It is the most powerful solvent known to history.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Everything solid melts into air," he went on. "All that is holy is profaned." Such a point applies to all those areas now being hurled to the tender mercies of the market.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is the first time that the anti-cuts and anti-fees movement has held big rallies at the weekend and it's a chance for all parents to get behind our children – to stand with them and to protect them from police violence.

                                • This article was amended at 15:42 on 28 January 2011. The original made reference to Sir Hugh Orde defending "hyper-kettling" – the practice of corralling activists into an area then decreasing the space. The Guardian news story referred to by Susan Matthews may have wrongly given the impression that Sir Hugh Orde himself used the phrase "hyper-kettling". He defended the practice of kettling in principle, but the words "hyper-kettling" were put to him by the journalist who conducted the original interview. This has now been corrected
