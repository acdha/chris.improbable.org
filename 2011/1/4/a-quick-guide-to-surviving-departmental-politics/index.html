                                There are some good guides to navigating office politics. This isn’t one of them. Rather, it’s a bare-bones survival guide for junior professors who would rather be doing anything other than wondering what their Sun Tzu-reading, Machiavelli-emulating colleagues are up to.
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Buy a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Straight-Man-Novel-Richard-Russo/dp/0375701907/">Straight Man</a> and read it carefully. Although it is an extremely funny book, resist the temptation to laugh by reminding yourself that all of the characters actually exist, and you work with them. If this seems to not be the case, it’s because you don’t know your colleagues well enough yet. Russo was a professor and everything in this book is true, especially the part about the goose.
                                </li>
                                <li>When you’re at a faculty meeting and a high-stakes decision is made uncharacteristically quickly, people are acting a bit out of character, or a group of people changes their story for no obvious reason, trust your intuition. Eight times out of ten you’re seeing the public face of some back-hallway deal. Keep your mouth shut and later on ask someone what was really going on. If they tell you nothing was going on, find someone smarter or more honest — eventually you’ll learn about a vast conspiracy that ends with grassy knolls and chemtrails (if not, your colleagues are a lot less creative than mine are). Then make up your own mind.
                                </li>
                                <li>Don’t be perceived as a threat. The easiest ways to do this are to appear to be career-centered and politically inept. Both of these come naturally to many of us.
                                </li>
                                <li>In a politically charged situation, saying the first thing that comes to mind is always wrong, unless it serves the goal of appearing inept (see #3).
                                </li>
                                <li>The way to understand almost any situation is to follow the money.&nbsp; Well, there’s probably not much money going around, so follow the resources that matter: faculty slots and space. When people speak, ask yourself what they stand to gain or lose; it won’t take long to notice that there are people who never speak against their short-term self interest. It’s useful to know.
                                </li>
                                <li>As long as you are single-mindedly career-focused, nobody is likely to stand in your way because the department benefits if your goals are met. Once you get entwined in hiring or curriculum issues, help out a colleague or student who’s being treated poorly, or similar, the possibility of conflict arises. Just be clear about your goals and try to understand others’ stake in the situation before charging in.
                                </li>
                                <li>Tenure, by putting incompatible, unfireable people in close proximity for decades on end, leads to behavior no daycare teacher would tolerate for a second. Learn some of the history behind the personality issues. The details will not be surprising or interesting, but they may help you understand (or at least diagnose) your colleagues’ behavior.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                So far I’ve muddled my way through using a combination of strategies: careerism, political ineptness, being too busy raising kids to care about much beyond my own teaching and research, and finding a large group of colleagues I genuinely like and respect. Let’s hope it keeps working.
                            </p>
