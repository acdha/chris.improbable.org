Introduction<br><br>   HTTP [RFC2616] is one of the most common application level protocols<br>   transported over TLS [RFC5246].  (This combination is commonly known<br>   as HTTPS based on the URL scheme used to indicate it.)  HTTPS clients<br>   have to function with a huge range of TLS implementations, some of<br>   higher quality than others.  This text aims to document some of the<br>   behaviours of existing HTTPS clients that are designed to ensure<br>   maximum interoperability.<br><br>   This text should not be taken as a recommendation that future HTTPS<br>   clients adopt these behaviours.  The security implications of each<br>   need to be carefully considered by each implementation.  However,<br>   these behaviours are common and the authors consider it better to<br>   document the state of practice than to simply wish it were otherwise.<br><br><br>2.  Handshake message fragmentation<br><br>   Many servers will fail to process a handshake message that spans more<br>   than one record.  These servers will close the connection when they<br>   encounter such a handshake message.  HTTPS clients will commonly<br>   ensure against that by either packing all handshake messages in a<br>   flow into a single record, or by creating a single record for each<br>   handshake message.<br><br><br>3.  Protocol Fallback<br><br>   Despite it being nearly twelve years since the publication of TLS 1.0<br>   [RFC2246], around 3% of HTTPS servers will reject a valid TLS<br>   "ClientHello".  These rejections can take the form of immediately<br>   closing the connection or a fatal alert.  Intolerance to the<br>   following has been observed:<br><br>      Advertising version TLS 1.0.<br><br>      Advertising a TLS version greater than TLS 1.0 (around 2% for 1.1<br>      or 1.2, around 3% for greater than 1.2).<br><br>      Advertising a version greater than 0x03ff (around 65% of servers)<br><br>      The presence of any extensions (around 7% of servers)<br><br>      The presence of specific extensions ("server_name" and<br>      "status_request" intolerance has been observed, although in very<br>      low numbers).<br><br>      The presence of any advertised compression algorithms<br><br>   Next, some servers will misbehave after processing the "ClientHello"<br>   message.  Negotiating the use of "DEFLATE" compression can result in<br>   fatal "bad_record_mac", "decompression_failure" or<br>   "decryption_failed" alerts.  Notably, OpenSSL prior to version 0.9.8c<br>   will intermittently fail to process compressed finished messages due<br>   to a work around of a previous padding bug.<br><br>   Lastly, some servers will negotiate the use of SSLv3 but select a<br>   TLS-only cipher suite.<br><br>   In all these cases, HTTPS clients will often enter a fallback mode.<br>   The connection is retried using only SSLv3 and without advertising<br>   any compression algorithms.  (This is obviously an easy downgrade<br>   attack.)  Also, the fallback can be triggered by transient network<br>   problems, which often manifest as an abruptly closed connection.<br>   Since SSLv3 does not provide any means of Server Name Indication<br>   [RFC3546], the fallback connection can use the wrong certificate<br>   chain, resulting in a very surprising certificate error.<br><br><br>4.  More implementation mistakes<br><br>   Non-fatal errors in version negotiation also occur.  Some 0.2% of<br>   servers use the version from the record header.  Around 0.6% of<br>   servers require that the version in the "ClientHello" and record<br>   header match in order to respect the version in the "ClientHello".  A<br>   very low number of servers echo whatever version the client<br>   advertises.<br><br>   In the event that the client supports a higher protocol version than<br>   the server, about 0.4% of servers require that the RSA<br>   "ClientKeyExchange" message include the server's protocol version.<br><br>   Some 30% of servers don't check the version in an RSA<br>   "ClientKeyExchange" at all.<br><br><br>5.  Certificate Chains<br><br>   Certificate chains presented by servers will commonly be missing<br>   intermediate certificates, have certificates in the wrong order and<br>   will include unrelated, superfluous certificates.  Servers have been<br>   observed presenting more than ten certificates in what we assume is a<br>   drive-by shooting approach to including the correct intermediate<br>   certificate.<br><br>   In order to validate chains which are missing certificates, some<br>   HTTPS clients will collect intermediate certificates from other<br>   servers.  Clients will commonly put all the presented certificates<br>   into a set and try to validate a chain assuming only that the first<br>   certificate is the leaf.<br><br><br>6.  Insufficient Security<br><br>   Some 65% of servers support SSLv2 (beyond just supporting the<br>   handshake in order to upgrade to SSLv3 or TLS).  HTTPS clients will<br>   typically not support SSLv2, nor send SSLv2 handshakes by default.<br>   Of those servers, 80% support the export ciphersuites.  (Although<br>   about 3% of those servers negotiate weak ciphersuites only to show a<br>   warning.)<br><br>   Some servers will choose very small multiplicative group sizes for<br>   their ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exchange (for example, 256-bits).<br>   Some HTTPS clients will reject all multiplicative group sizes smaller<br>   than 512-bits while others will retry after demoting DHE ciphersuites<br>   in their "ClientHello".<br><br><br>7.  Acknowledgements<br><br>   Yngve Pettersen made significant contributions and many of the<br>   numbers in this document come from his scanning work.  Other numbers<br>   were taken from Ivan Ristic's SSL Survey.<br><br>   Thanks to Wan Teh Chang for reviewing early drafts.<br><br><br>8.  Normative References<br><br>   [RFC2246]  Dierks, T. and C.
