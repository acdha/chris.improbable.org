                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So, I listened to the State Of The Union speech last Tuesday on my way home from an early gig.  It was a good speech, full of grand 30,000 foot ideas for Moving The Nation Forward, delivered in the optimistic, avuncular style that Obama is so good at.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Here are a number of things I did not hear, and which are also part of the state of our union ca. 2011.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Millions of people face severe financial hardship, if not ruin, due to the obscene and irresponsible greed of a very small number of folks.  Because the Congress is captive to anybody with large sums of money to spend, nothing particularly effective will be done to prevent things like this from happening again.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are about 25 professional registered lobbyists for every member of Congress.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As we enter our tenth year of war in Afghanistan, it's clear that we have a tiger by the tail there, and whatever opportunity we might ever have had to bring about a constructive outcome was pissed away years ago.  We can't simply walk away without losing face, so we will stumble around there for a while longer, at great expense and further loss of life, until we can find a sufficiently non-embarrassing way to cut the Afghans loose.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We should probably consider our presence in Iraq to be more or less permanent.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We will never bring any form of justice to Osama Bin Laden or Ayman Al-Zawahiri.  Nobody even really thinks about them anymore.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The country goes deeper and deeper into debt on a daily basis.  The greatest financial threat the nation faces is the cost of health care, and nobody in a position to actually make or enforce policy has any freaking clue how to manage or control that.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Over the last 30 years, the American middle class has been gutted by the loss of jobs to offshoring and automation.  We continue to have a strongly entrepreneurial and innovative economy, but when it's time for bright new ideas to scale up to an industrial level of production, much if not most of that happens overseas.  So, wealth, but jobs, not so much.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We no longer waterboard (apparently) but other forms of "enhanced interrogation" are still in use, and the basic legal arguments that justify their use still stand.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The rash and often illegal ways in which "global war on terror" related prisoners were captured, held, and handled over the last ten years has made it impossible to proceed with straightforward due process for many of them.  We will therefore be maintaining our facility at Guantanamo Bay indefinitely, probably until the last of them dies of old age.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We have very low inflation, unless you include food and energy.  So if you don't eat, heat your home, or drive, the dollar you make today will we be worth about what it is today for quite a while.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    About 2 million Americans are in prison, where they are subject to sexual assault and general brutality.  Prisoners in highly secure prisoners are subject to isolation conditions that reliably make them severely insane.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Two and a quarter centuries into our big experiment in self-government.  We haven't crossed over into that promised land quite yet.
                                </p>
