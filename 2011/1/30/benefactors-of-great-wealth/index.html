                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                I thought about titling this review of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0990407/">The Green Hornet</a> (3D IMAX version), “<a href="http://www.celtic-twilight.com/camelot/weston/fr2r/index.htm">From Ritual to Bromance</a>,” because a major thing it’s about is that, if you’re like me, you can’t remember who played the title character in the short-lived 1960s TV series without looking it up, but you damn sure remember that <em>Fucking Bruce Lee</em> played Kato. In the new movie, Jay Chou plays Kato, but really, Jay Chou plays <em>Fucking Bruce Lee</em>, oodles cooler than his senior partner but cast in the sidekick role by conventions of race, class and circumstance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But that braid of the movie’s rope twines with its other theme: more consciously than the Batman or Iron Man movies, GH is about Capital-P Privilege as a superpower. Britt Reid, the Green Hornet, isn’t that bright and can’t fight worth a damn (for most of the movie). He’s <em>second</em>-best at getting in a couple of kicks at bad guys Kato has already dropped. He’s <em>best</em> at writing checks. He’s good-hearted enough; the movie makes sure to establish that. He wants to do the right thing, particularly when it’s fun. In fact, GH gives its heroes as plausible a motivation for becoming crimefighters as any recent superhero movie: they discover that <em>fighting crime is a blast</em>. And, thanks to Britt Reid’s inheritance, they can afford it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Is it a great movie about privilege as a superpower? <em>Person-of-color, please</em>. When it comes to the dark side of wealth and status, it hits more like Seth Rogan than Jay Chou, let alone <em>Fucking Bruce Lee</em>. And it wimps out on the Hornet’s own martial mediocrity in the climactic fight. It’s an action comedy, not an EM Forster novel. But it does make good comedic use of Reid’s ability to pull rank on Kato when he starts feeling too inferior, and Seth Rogen does bring out the lead’s dick-ish qualities. Reid’s high-handedness and refusal to recognize who the natural leader of the duo is gets them in trouble on multiple occasions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, Kato is saved from <a href="http://www.ponylandpress.com/ms-test.html">Mary-Suedom</a> by his sexism, and to the movie’s credit it thinks sexism is bad. It’s about as feminist as a movie can be without passing the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBechdelTest">Bechdel Test</a>. Which is maybe not very feminist, but Lenore Case (Cameron Diaz) gets to be the mastermind of the operation, reject both male leads romantic attentions, threaten to sue  for sexual harassment if she’s not left to mastermind the operation in peace, and be presented as a sympathetic voice of maturity rather than a ballbusting bitch.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The plot-qua-plot is deliberately thin, which is not a bad thing: it exists to hang scenes of Rogen and Chou bromancing, breaking up and breconciling. With some other branches to hook fights to. The fights themselves are slapstick/gritty – there’s no grandiose wire-fu. I didn’t find any of the action sequences mindblowing. Some were reasonably funny. A set-piece squabble between Rogen and Chou was very funny. In IMAX, some of the 3D effects were genuinely awful, especially lawn textures in a couple of cemetary scenes. Other times the 3D effects were so understated they hardly seemed distinct from standard big-screen 2D.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The only reason I don’t regret paying IMAX prices for the thing is that I took my 14-year-old son and he really liked it. This might work for you too, so give him a call if you’re inclined. Okay, I also got to see the IMAX 3D <a href="http://thor.marvel.com/">Thor</a> preview. Otherwise, if you’re inclined to watch it in the theater, just go with the two-dimensional version. Overall, it was better than I expected. Not good enough to declare it must-see superhero-movie viewing, but several cuts above <em>avoid at all costs</em>.
