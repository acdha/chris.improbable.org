                            <p>
                                Yesterday <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/2011/01/19/nhs-reform-leaves-tory-backers-with-links-to-private-healthcare-firms-set-for-bonanza-115875-22859373/">the Daily Mirror</a> revealed:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    A Mirror investigation can today reveal private health firms set to cash in on Conservative plans to rip apart the NHS have poured a fortune into the party. The wealthy owners, who have made huge sums from the healthcare industry, have donated around £750,000 since David Cameron became leader.<br>
                                    …<br>
                                    Hedge fund boss <strong>John Nash</strong> is one of the major Conservative donors with close ties to the healthcare industry. He and wife Caroline gave £203,500 to the party over the past five years.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The cash included £21,000 which was given directly to Health Secretary Andrew Lansley to bankroll his office before the Conservatives took power. At the time the Lib Dems slammed the payments as a “staggering conflict of interest”.<br>
                                    …<br>
                                    Nursing and care home tycoon <strong>Dolar Popat</strong> has given the Conservatives £209,000. The Ugandan-born dad-of-three has amassed an estimated £42million fortune as founder and chief of TLC Group, which provides services for the elderly. Mr Cameron made the businessman a peer shortly after entering No10 last May, and Lord Popat’s donations include a £25,000 gift registered a week after the Tories’ health reforms were unveiled last July.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>IC Technology</strong>, which provides computer services to the NHS, has handed the Tories £70,000 over the past two years.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Philip Scott</strong>, chief of the Priory Group, has donated £20,000.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Balding Mr Cameron also got money from an up-market firm treating hair loss. The <strong>Trichological Clinic Limited</strong>, which operates out of Harrods, gave the Conservatives £10,000 last year.

                                    As the film reveals, some of Lansley and David Cameron’s supporters have spoken of “denationalisation”, and called the NHS an “abhorrence”.

                                Kingsley Manning, business development director for health at Tribal (who are looking to get into the commissioning process) said in July last year:

                                    This white paper could amount to the denationalisation of healthcare services in England and is the most important redirection of the NHS in more than a generation, going further than any Secretary of State has gone before.
