                                In the wake of Verizon's decision to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/01/verizon-sues-fcc-says-net-neutrality-lite-rules-illegal.ars">sue the FCC over its net neutrality rules</a>, it's worth taking a look back at the rules Verizon actually supported last autumn. In an effort to head off the FCC effort, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/telecom/news/2010/08/google-verizon-unveil-net-neutrality-lite-to-government.ars">Verizon huddled quietly with Google</a> and produced a "suggested legislative framework" for net neutrality. It looked quite remarkably similar to the rules eventually adopted at the FCC—the rules that Verizon has chosen to sue over now as being "contrary to constitutional right" and "otherwise contrary to law."

                                                A provider that offers a broadband Internet access service complying with the above principles could offer any other additional or differentiated services. Such other services would have to be distinguishable in scope and purpose from broadband Internet access service, but could make use of or access Internet content, applications or services and could include traffic prioritization. The FCC would publish an annual report on the effect of these additional services, and immediately report if it finds at any time that these services threaten the meaningful availability of broadband Internet access services or have been devised or promoted in a manner designed to evade these consumer protections.

These “specialized services” can benefit end users and spur investment, but they may also present risks to the open Internet. We will closely monitor specialized services and their effects on broadband service to ensure, through all available mechanisms, that they supplement but do not supplant the open Internet.

                                                Because of the unique technical and operational characteristics of wireless networks, and the competitive and still-developing nature of wireless broadband services, only the transparency principle would apply to wireless broadband at this time. The U.S. Government Accountability Office would report to Congress annually on the continued development and robustness of wireless broadband Internet access services.

                                                Mobile broadband is at an earlier stage in its development than fixed broadband and is evolving rapidly. For that and other reasons discussed below, we conclude that it is appropriate at this time to take measured steps in this area. Accordingly, we require mobile broadband providers to comply with the transparency rule, which includes enforceable disclosure obligations regarding device and application certification and approval processes; we prohibit providers from blocking lawful websites; and we prohibit providers from blocking applications that compete with providers’ voice and video telephony services. We will closely monitor the development of the mobile broadband market and will adjust the framework we adopt today as appropriate.

                                The similarity here is astonishing, though the Verizon/Google proposal did make one other suggestion: it should be passed by Congress, not the FCC, and the FCC should not have "rulemaking authority" over nondiscrimination requirements and consumer protections. In other words, the FCC could have a bit of enforcement power, but it would be forbidden from writing key new regulations that might alter or expand its power over networks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And that was apparently enough to set Verizon off. In a statement today, Verizon said that it was "deeply concerned by the FCC's assertion of broad authority for sweeping new regulation of broadband networks and the Internet itself. We believe this assertion of authority goes well beyond any authority provided by Congress, and creates uncertainty for the communications industry, innovators, investors and consumers."

                                When Congress addresses an issue, it doesn't muck about with it again for quite some time—just look at something like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. Regulatory agencies can operate at a slightly less glacial pace, and the extra uncertainty this can create might be bad for investment. So now Verizon will duke it out in court with an agency that lost a similar battle in 2010—even though, on substance, it got exactly what it wanted.
