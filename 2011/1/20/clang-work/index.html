                            <p>
                                Googlers get 20% time -- time to work on something not necessarily part of your direct goals -- as an outlet to allow bottom-up work. I spent my 20% time over the last few months getting our build working under the <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a> compiler.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The work was kind of repetitive: adjusting our build system to support clang, then seeing what built, what didn't, and whether to blame our code or the compiler. It found a number of Chrome bugs! A simple check that gcc apparently lacked is accidentally initializing a member variable with itself rather than the argument:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
<code>class Foo {
  int bar_;
  Foo(int bar) : bar_(bar_) { }
  // Intended to write:
  // Foo(int bar) : bar_(bar) { }
};
</code>
</pre>
                            <p>
                                We also found a number of clang bugs; <a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?emailassigned_to1=1&amp;query_format=advanced&amp;emailcc1=1&amp;emailreporter1=1&amp;email1=evan%40chromium.org&amp;emailtype1=substring">here's a link to the bugs I'm involved with on their tracker</a>, most of which are about bugs we encountered. It turned out that v8 in particular has a ton of gnarly C++ stuff related to instantiating templates. I found the <a href="http://delta.tigris.org/">delta</a> tool particularly useful in providing reduced test cases, and my coworker Jeffrey Yasskin particularly helpful in C++ wizardry.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    An aside: I'd provide a link for Jeffrey but everything I could find was pretty out of date; instead, a story I like to tell about interviewing. I once observed an interview where the interviewer asked the candidate to evaluate their knowledge on a scale from 1 to 5 in various areas on their resume, as a way of guiding which sorts of things they would ask. The candidate rated themselves a 4 on C++, which I now know in retrospect is actually a red flag: pretty much anyone who claims to be above a 3 out of 5 in C++ knows too little to know how much of C++ they don't know.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Jeffrey may be one of the rare true 4s; he patiently tried to explain to me argument-dependent and two-phase lookup a number of times. I doubt I would've been able to complete this clang project if he hadn't happened to be sitting in our office for those few months.
                                </p>

                                Now that Chrome builds under clang, I'm not exactly sure why I started the project. I think I was motivated by a few factors:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>wanting to see if the compiler really was faster than gcc with better error messages (answer: yes, though building with gcc is still faster for us due to <a href="http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=7554">this bug</a>; longer-term, I expect us to switch once the resulting binaries are faster)
                                </li>
                                <li>finding more Chrome bugs (success)
                                </li>
                                <li>wanting to learn more about how clang works, both to be able to use it for static analysis tools and to be able to improve the compiler for our needs
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                On that last point, two more stories.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One: a somewhat common code modification problem relates to the way overloading works. Suppose you have a base class with a virtual function and a tree of classes that sometimes imlement the interface.
                            </p>
                            <pre>
<code>class Base {
  virtual Foo* MakeFoo(int some_param) {
    return new SimpleFoo(some_param);
  }
};
class Derived : public Base {
  virtual Foo* MakeFoo(int some_param) {
    return new MoreComplicatedFoo(some_param);
  }
};
</code>
</pre>
                            <p>
                                Now suppose you want to modify the signature of <code>MakeFoo</code> to take another argument. You need to adjust every class's <code>MakeFoo</code>, and if you miss any one of them, like <code>Derived::MakeFoo</code>, everything will compile just fine (C++ just sees it as a different overloaded function due to its different signature) but when you call <code>MakeFoo</code> on a <code>Derived</code> you'll get the wrong type back.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I lost a few hours to this once, and again was saved by a brilliant coworker who happened to be temporarily sitting in my office -- this one immediately dereferenced the vtable on the pointer in gdb to see that we were getting back a <code>SimpleFoo</code> where we expected a <code>MoreComplicatedFoo</code> (as for why gdb couldn't tell us the type of the pointee itself, I don't know why it didn't work; the code was of course much more complicated than the above).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anyway, it turns out that Microsoft's C++ compiler, I think due to C# making use of it, adds an <code>override</code> keyword that says "give me a compiler warning if this is not overriding a virtual function in a superclass". This would've saved me a lot of grief, had the functions been annotated. <em>And</em> it turns out that C++0x has some notion of the same thing, and that because of this (I think?) clang already parses <code>__attribute__((override))</code> in the same location as Microsoft's keyword.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At the time I discovered this, the attribute was parsed but ignored. This allowed me to write a clang plugin to verify the overrides on Mac and Linux while relying on the system compiler on Windows. Here's the macro from the Chrome tree:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
<code>// Annotate a virtual method indicating it must be overriding a virtual
// method in the parent class.
// Use like:
//   virtual void foo() OVERRIDE;
#if defined(COMPILER_MSVC)
#define OVERRIDE override
#elif defined(__clang__)
#define OVERRIDE __attribute__((override))
#else
#define OVERRIDE
#endif
</code>
</pre>
                            <p>
                                More recently the checking was added to clang itself (I should've just written it as part of the compiler in the first place, but I wanted to learn about plugins), so we now can use this throughout the Chrome code to hopefully make us more resilient to future refactoring bugs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Here's the second clang story. A hard-to-spot typo made it into the Chrome tree; <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/browser/tab_contents/thumbnail_generator.cc?r1=71666&amp;r2=71665&amp;pathrev=71666">here's the diff</a>, but the wrong code is easy enough to spot once you know something is wrong:
                            </p>
                            <pre>
<code>if (monitor |= currently_monitored) {
</code>
</pre>
                            <p>
                                Nico from the Chrome team reasonably pointed out that you get a compiler warning when you use a single equals in an <code>if</code>, and filed a bug against clang. Hans from the Chrome team <a href="http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project?view=rev&amp;revision=123836">implemented it for clang</a>. And after it landed, it found <a href="http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project?view=rev&amp;revision=123872">the same bug in the clang code</a> itself!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are more stories, like how Elliot has been writing analyzers to enforce some of our coding guidelines, but this post is long enough already. For more information, see our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/Clang">wiki page</a> which links to our mailing list and other projects.
