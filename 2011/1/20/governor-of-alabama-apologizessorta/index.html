                                Robert Bentley must have been feeling some political heat. After <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/01/but_i_dont_think_i_want_to_be.php">openly announcing his sectarian bias in a MLK Day speech</a>, <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/2011/01/19/2596096/alabama-governor-apologizes-for.html">Bentley has offered a not-pology</a>.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    If anyone from other religions felt disenfranchised by the language, I want to say I am sorry. I am sorry if I offended anyone in any way.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Jebus, but I hate that poor excuse for an apology. It happens all the time; someone says something stupid and wrong, and instead of saying, "I was wrong, I'm sorry and will try to change," they say, "I'm sorry you were offended by my remarks" — suddenly, the problem lies not in the error of the speaker but in the sensitivity of the listener.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That's not an apology. It's a transparent attempt to twist the blame to fall on everyone else but the person who made the mistake.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even that's too generous: this wasn't a mistake. Bentley was honestly and intentionally expressing his views, as he has said, "speaking as an evangelical Christian to fellow Baptists." The man sincerely believes that his fellow superstitious louts are his special brothers and sisters who he has been elected to serve, and the riff-raff who don't go to his church are of lesser consideration.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That's what he needed to apologize for, and correct. He doesn't need to apologize for people finding offense in his stupidity and bias.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He especially doesn't need to apologize for that because pandering to a smug majority is what got him elected in the first place.
