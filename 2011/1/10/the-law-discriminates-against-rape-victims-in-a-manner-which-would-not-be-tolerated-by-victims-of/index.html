                        <blockquote>
                            ““The law discriminates against rape victims in a manner which would not be tolerated by victims of any other crime. In the following example, a holdup victim is asked questions similar in form to those usually asked a victim of rape. “Mr. Smith, you were held up at gunpoint on the corner of 16th and Locust?”<br>
                            “Yes.”<br>
                            “Did you struggle with the robber?”<br>
                            “No.”<br>
                            “Why not?”<br>
                            “He was armed.”<br>
                            “Then you made a conscious decision to comply with his demands rather than to resist?”<br>
                            “Yes.”<br>
                            “Did you scream? Cry out?”<br>
                            “No. I was afraid.”<br>
                            “I see. Have you ever been held up before?”<br>
                            “No.”<br>
                            “Have you ever given money away?”<br>
                            “Yes, of course–”<br>
                            “And did you do so willingly?”<br>
                            “What are you getting at?”<br>
                            “Well, let’s put it like this, Mr. Smith. You’ve given away money in the past–in fact, you have quite a reputation for philanthropy. How can we be sure that you weren’t contriving to have your money taken from you by force?”<br>
                            “Listen, if I wanted–”<br>
                            “Never mind. What time did this holdup take place, Mr. Smith?”<br>
                            “About 11 p.m.”<br>
                            “You were out on the streets at 11 p.m.? Doing what?”<br>
                            “Just walking.”<br>
                            “Just walking? You know it’s dangerous being out on the street that late at night. Weren’t you aware that you could have been held up?”<br>
                            “I hadn’t thought about it.”<br>
                            “What were you wearing at the time, Mr. Smith?”<br>
                            “Let’s see. A suit. Yes, a suit.”<br>
                            “An expensive suit?”<br>
                            “Well–yes.”<br>
                            “In other words, Mr. Smith, you were walking around the streets late at night in a suit that practically advertised the fact that you might be a good target for some easy money, isn’t that so? I mean, if we didn’t know better, Mr. Smith, we might even think you were asking for this to happen, mightn’t we?”<br>
                            “Look, can’t we talk about the past history of the guy who did this to me?”<br>
                            “I’m afraid not, Mr. Smith. I don’t think you would want to violate his rights, now, would you?”””<br>
                            <br>
