                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                A principal at a Long Island high school has blocked a group of LGBT and straight students from forming a gay-straight alliance at Valley Stream South High School. The principal, Maureen Henry, denied the request after three students -- with the support of several hundred of their classmates -- submitted a proposal to form an official school club. The students had been working on the proposal since October, and <a href="http://www.liherald.com/stories/South-High-seniors-fighting-for-Gay-Straight-Alliance,30109?page=1&amp;content_source=">tell the <em>Long Island Herald</em></a> that they followed all proper protocols and procedures.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Still, Principal Henry denied their request. And here's an added insult to injury: when the students told Principal Henry about rampant anti-gay slurs, including use of the word "faggot" in the school, the Principal said it wasn't that big of a deal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Principal Henry told the students that she too called people 'faggots' when she was young and didn’t mean anything bad by it," <a href="http://www.ligaly.org/news.php?i=167">says a press release from LIGALY</a>, the Long Island Gay and Lesbian Youth organization.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Right, because "Faggot" is such a positive, uplifting term of endearment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The students involved in trying to organize the club have taken their case to the Superintendent of the School District, Dr. Richard Marsh, in hopes that administrators can step in and assist both LGBT and straight students looking to create some safe spaces within Valley Stream South High School.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "We did everything right," said Kelly Egan, one of the students trying to start the club. "I don’t see why you wouldn’t want to promote tolerance and safety.” Egan went on to note that another high school in the district -- North High School -- has a gay-straight alliance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                LIGALY is not taking this quietly. <a href="http://www.ligaly.org/news.php?i=167">They've planned a demonstration</a> in front of the school this afternoon, with their leadership saying that Principal Henry is essentially bullying her students by shutting down any possibility of a gay-straight alliance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “The core issue, in my opinion, is the barriers the principal is putting up in front of them," said Robert Vitelli, a 1992 graduate of Valley Stream South High School and director of development at LIGALY.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unnecessary barriers, if you ask us. <a href="http://gayrights.change.org/petitions/view/tell_valley_stream_south_high_school_allow_gay-straight_alliance_for_students">How about sending Principal Henry, as well as Superintendent Marsh, a message</a> that blocking your students from forming gay-straight alliances is irresponsible behavior from educators that are supposed to look out for the welfare of all of their students. Moreover, for Principal Henry to suggest that calling people "faggots" is no big deal shows exactly why a gay-straight alliance is needed in a place like Valley Stream South High School.
