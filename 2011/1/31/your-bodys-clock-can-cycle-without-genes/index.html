                            <p>
                                Circadian clocks ensure that we modulate our physiological behaviors, like sleeping and eating, in a rhythmic, 24-hour cycle. They are present in all living cells, from cyanobacteria to humans. The circadian clock is temperature compensated, meaning that it does not speed up or slow down regardless of temperature; it's also entrained, meaning that it can reset according to external cues, like light, temperature and food. The selective advantage of entrainment becomes apparent as you debark from a flight that crosses time zones.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On a molecular level, this clock appears to be based on a feedback loop whereby the products of a set of clock genes negatively regulate their own expression, guaranteeing a rhythmic production. The specific clock genes are not conserved across distant species, but the underlying mechanism is the same.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yet John O’Neill and Akhilesh Reddy at the University of Cambridge have used two very clever experimental systems to show that a circadian rhythm can persist even when these genes are not transcribed into RNA. The first system they used is human red blood cells, which lack a nucleus, so they have no transcriptional machinery or even genes to transcribe. The second is the single-celled alga <em>Osteococcus tauri</em>, one of the most primitive nucleated cells known.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Cycling without genes
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Red blood cells transport oxygen from the heart all over the body. As such, they are packed so tightly with hemoglobin that they don’t have any room to spare for a nucleus. They do, however, have antioxidant proteins called peroxiredoxins to control levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the liver, peroxiredoxins&nbsp;have circadian rhythms of expression.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                O’Neill and Reddy demonstrated that, in red blood cells from three individuals, peroxiredoxin levels stayed constant, but pairs of the proteins bound together and came apart in a 24-hour cycle. This cycle was temperature compensated—it retained its periodicity over three days at both 37ºC and 32ºC. (They tried putting the cells at 42ºC, but they died.) &nbsp;The peroxiredoxins maintained their cycles even in constant light. The cycle could also be entrained. When the cells were exposed to alternating high and low temperatures, they adjusted their schedules accordingly, even if that required them to completely reverse the phase of their cycle.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All that happened without gene transcription. Hemoglobin molecules in these cells also bind together, and they also do so in a rhythmic manner, but it's not yet known if hemoglobin’s oscillations are temperature compensated or entrained. The researchers thought that these rhythms might correlate with metabolic pathways and, when they checked, they found that ATP levels in red blood cells also oscillated in 24-hour cycles.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Cycling in the dark
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The other cell type they examined, <em>O. tauri</em>, possess nuclei and thus genes, but the organism has a cool and very useful property: when kept in the dark, it halts all transcription of its genes, and its clock comes to a halt. When shifted back into the light, both transcription and their clocks restart. However, the clock does not simply reset; rather, each cell resumes at the point in the cycle where it left off, so it keeps track of time in the dark, even though there is no gene transcription.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                How do they do it? You guessed it—using the same peroxiredoxin enzymes O’Neill and Reddy identified in human red blood cells. In <em>O. tauri</em>, peroxiredoxin molecules bound together in couples and came apart in 24-hour cycles, even in the dark, even without transcription. Unlock clock genes, these proteins are highly conserved across the three major phylogenic kingdoms (eukaroytes, archaea, and bacteria), making them an attractive candidate for a fundamental regulator of circadian clocks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                O’Neill and Reddy stress that transcription clearly plays a pivotal role in maintaining circadian clocks. But they also point out that we already knew that cells can maintain their clocks without it. For instance, during cell division, making a copy of the DNA shuts down transcriptional activity, but the clock resumes afterwards without resetting. Moreover, there are organisms that have clocks but lack clock genes, like yeast and <em>C. elegans</em>.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These results don't demonstrate that peroxiredoxins are essential for circadian rhythms, but there is evidence indicating that the genetic and metabolic clock regulators interact. O’Neill and Reddy have discovered that cells from mice with mutated clock genes also have altered peroxiredoxin rhythms, and conversely, cell lines in which expression of peroxiredoxins is disrupted have distorted circadian rhythms. But, right now at least, we don't know how these regulators impact each other. Figuring that out has already been started in cyanobacteria, and hopefully it will be worked out in nucleated cells soon. The clock is ticking.
