                            <p>
                                The Congressional Budget Office took a look at the Republican repeal bill and came back with <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12040/01-06-PPACA_Repeal.pdf">some numbers</a> (pdf) the GOP isn't going to like. Jon Cohn <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/80967/breaking-cbo-confirms-repeal-stuff-you-wont">summarizes</a>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    The news from the CBO is exactly what you would have thought: Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act will mean higher deficits. The CBO is projecting that repeal would increase the federal deficit by around $230 billion in the next decade and by an even larger amount after that.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Wait, there's more. The CBO also estimated how repeal would affect insurance premiums. And, once again, the effect is entirely predictable. Premiums for people buying coverage on their own would fall a bit, but only because people were getting less protective insurance and because many with pre-existing conditions would be locked out of the market altogether. And even though premiums would be lower, many people buying coverage on their own would still end up paying more for their policies, because they would not benefit from the enormous subsidies that the Affordable Care Act makes available.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Speaking of people locked out of the insurance market, the CBO ran the numbers on the uninsured. An additional 32 million people would be expected to go without health insurance, bringing the percentage of non-elderly adults without coverage to 17 percent, which is more or less what it is today.
                                </p>

                                Rep. Anthony Wiener is pushing an amendment to the repeal legislation that would say no such legislation could pass unless it was deficit neutral. The odds that Republicans allow his amendment to be offered -- much less embrace it as part of their crusade to cut the size of the deficit -- do not seem good.
