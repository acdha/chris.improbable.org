                                While most of us were sleeping off Christmas dinner or watching college football on TV, teams of engineers, students and aspiring rocketeers around the globe were working to become the first private enterprise to land a working rover on the Moon. The $30,000,000 <a href="http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/">Google Lunar X PRIZE</a>, first announced a bit more than three years ago, officially closed to new registrations on December 31, 2010, with over 20 participating teams.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some teams are tightly knit groups of entrepreneurs with decades of industry experience, some are college students and recent graduates working on the biggest design project of their lives, and some are volunteers and self-described "<a href="http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/lunar/teams/part-time-scientists">part-time scientists</a>" relying on hundreds of online collaborators for success. Some have already earned contracts from NASA and other groups in support of their work to date—but at the end of the day, only one group can get to the Moon first. Who will it be? And does every team <em>really</em> think they have a shot? Let's take a look at a few of the teams who are competing.
                            </p>
                            <div style="float:right">

                                But first, a quick refresher. If you're not immediately familiar with the Google Lunar X PRIZE, you may remember it better as one of the successors to the <a href="http://space.xprize.org/ansari-x-prize">Ansari X PRIZE</a>, the $10,000,000 competition for sub-orbital human spaceflight which produced <em>SpaceShipOne</em> and <a href="http://www.virgingalactic.com/">Virgin Galactic</a>. The GLXP is much the same concept: a $20 million prize awaits the first team to successfully land a robotic craft on the lunar surface, have it move at least 500 meters, and transmit high-definition images and video. The second team to succeed gets a $5 million prize, with the remaining $5 million left for 'bonuses' such as traveling over 5 kilometers on the Moon or landing near lunar "sites of interest" such as an Apollo landing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "My favorite part of the Google Lunar X PRIZE is the way it provides the impetus for these incredibly brilliant innovators from all over the world to throw themselves all out into such a difficult and inspiring mission," says Will Pomerantz, senior director of Space Projects for the X PRIZE Foundation. "Many of these team members are people who would never have responded to a standard RFP from a space agency, but these people have proven track records of success and the great ideas and practices they've honed in other industries, and it's tantalizing to see those concepts applied to space exploration."

                                The Rocket City Space Pioneers

                            <p>
                                The Google Lunar X PRIZE has worked hard to include a strong social component—<a href="http://thelaunchpad.xprize.org/">their official blog</a> frequently hosts interactive "<a href="http://thelaunchpad.xprize.org/2009/07/friday-fun-day-ffd-science-and.html">Friday Fundays</a>" involving Q-and-As and Photoshop contests, and teams are highly encouraged to provide weekly updates on their own webspace. Even the most dedicated fans, then, may run the risk of finding themselves unable to keep up with each team's progress. Fortunately, one space blogger has helped spectators out by creating a <a href="http://evadot.com/glxpscorecard/">running scorecard</a> of each team, roughly depicting their perceived likelihood of being able to win the GLXP. Near the top of that list is the <a href="http://www.rocketcityspacepioneers.com/">Rocket City Space Pioneers</a>, a team of propulsion and rocketry experts from Huntsville, Alabama.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                RCSP was a late entry to the Google Lunar X PRIZE, waiting until last September 7 to announce their registration, but they appear dedicated to make up for their late start with a surplus of experience and institutional support. Team leader Tim Pickens, for example, was the lead propulsion designer for the <em>SpaceShipOne</em> craft which won the inaugural X PRIZE, though many in the space industry known him equally well as the guy who <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RxC2vAmS4o">created a rocket-powered pickup truck</a> (complete with "In Thrust We Trust" bumper sticker). Pickens currently heads the propulsion efforts for Dynetics, one of several Huntsville-area groups putting their support behind Rocket City, along with Andrews Aerospace and the University of Alabama at Huntsville.

                                Although the Rocket City Space Pioneers' design plans are still in the works, they have revealed that (like the majority of GLXP teams) they'll be using SpaceX's recently debuted Falcon 9 rocket to launch their craft into Earth orbit, with self-designed propulsion module injecting their lander/rover into lunar orbit and, ultimately, onto the Moon's surface. The system as a whole is designed to be capable of exploring a variety of planetary bodies, helping to illustrate one of the chief appeals of the incentive prize system: just as the Ansari X PRIZE produced advances in low-earth-orbit transportation which are currently being explored for space tourism and scientific research, so may the Google Lunar X PRIZE lead to breakthroughs in inexpensive unmanned planetary exploration.

                                RCSP's potential derives in large part from their centralization and collaborative history; on the complete opposite end of the spectrum lies <a href="http://www.frednet.com/">FREDNET</a>, a team dedicated to applying the principles of open source development to lunar exploration. Founded by Fred Bourgeois, III, a software developer and engineer from the Bay Area, FREDNET aims "to demonstrate that open source collaborations are capable of phenomenal successes" in the space industry; "[a]s individual scientists and engineers, we know or suspect that open collaboration produces open products in the most productive and efficient way possible." Although FREDNET is guided by an advisory board and internal development team, topics ranging from rover prototypes to discussions of how to split the money are discussed and developed on the public team forums and wiki, which have hundreds of active participants from over 60 countries on 6 continents.

                            <p>
                                Even setting aside the volunteers helping out for FREDNET, the Google Lunar X PRIZE has several teams where college graduates, and even undergraduates, are playing a significant role. (Anyone who recalls the factoid about the average Apollo Program scientist being 26 years old knows that the space industry has never been one to turn away the young.) One such team is <a href="http://omegaenvoy.org/home.html">Omega Envoy</a>, founded and directed by college students at the University of Central Florida. Although Omega Envoy has created partnerships with groups like the Florida Space Grant Consortium and 4Frontiers, the vast majority of their team members are students pursuing degrees in fields such as aerospace and mechanical engineering. In spite of their schedules, Omega Envoy has already created a working prototype for their lunar rover, <a href="http://omegaenvoy.blogspot.com/2009/07/rover-20-first-demonstration-de-brief.html">which they tested</a> at the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station on Devon Island.

                                Omega Envoy (as of this writing) is the only registered GLXP team founded and run by students, but many others are taking the opportunity to use the competition as a means of engaging in science outreach and education. Team <a href="http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/lunar/teams/jurban">JURBAN</a>, for example, is a product of the Juxtopia Group, an organization dedicated to promoting STEM education in disadvantaged and underserved groups. Although much of their work to date has been in the Baltimore, Maryland area, they've also worked with students as far away as <a href="http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/lunar/teams/jurban/blog/jurban-recruits-students-from-accra-ghana">Accra, Ghana</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Educational outreach isn't the only immediate impact that these teams have made; the designs and methodologies of Google Lunar X PRIZE teams have already attracted the attention of national space organizations. In October, NASA introduced the <a href="http://thelaunchpad.xprize.org/2010/08/applauding-nasas-efforts-to-benefit.html">Innovative Lunar Demonstrations and Data</a> program, announcing their intentions to purchase lunar exploration data from commercial lunar landers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rocket City Space Pioneers, FREDNET, and Omega Envoy were all among the six inaugural participants selected for the program, which has earned each team $10,000 and may ultimately reward a group with up to $10,000,000. (Google Lunar X PRIZE teams are required to receive at least 90 percent of their funding from private sources, in keeping with the prize's spirit of private enterprise.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many teams are currently soliciting sponsorship from private sources, selling cargo space on their lunar-bound rockets, and conducting more traditional sources of fundraising.) On December 20, NASA <a href="http://thelaunchpad.xprize.org/2010/12/three-google-lunar-x-prize-competitors.html">purchased a second round of data</a> from three GLXP teams in contracts valued at $500,000 each, demonstrating that these teams are already producing results with years to go before actually landing on the moon.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                We'll be there in 2013... we hope
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Yet this leads to the big question: how many years <em>are</em> there to go before a team has a chance to win the prize? Although the GLXP officially ends in 2015, the first prize drops from $20 million to $15 million if a government-funded mission (currently projected for 2013) arrives there first, and some observers have begun to express their concerns that many teams have next to no chance of making either deadline. Updates from some have become sporadic, and three teams have dropped out altogether or merged into others.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A brave few teams have taken the step of predicting their successful landing date—notably front-runner <a href="http://astrobotic.net/">Astrobotic</a>, which plans to begin its "Tranquility Trek" in 2013. More generally, though, the majority of active teams are maintaining a positive attitude about their chances; both RCSP and FREDNET affirm their intentions of winning the grand prize on their websites. Even Omega Envoy is in this for the long haul: Project Director Ruben Nunez says that "Omega Envoy has a very good chance of winning the GLXP," citing their integration of off-the-shelf hardware with proprietary platforms as a means of cutting development time and costs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even if some teams run out of gas before the finish line, though, their contributions in research and development, educational outreach, and demonstrating the power of a small group of committed people will have made their participation more than worthwhile. The US government seems to agree, too; on December 21, <a href="http://thelaunchpad.xprize.org/2010/12/us-congress-gives-all-federal-agencies.html">Congress passed the America COMPETES Act</a>, giving federal agencies the ability to conduct X PRIZE-style incentive competitions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, it's difficult to imagine that any team entered this competition expecting it to be easy, and the space industry has (to put it lightly) never shied away from doing the impossible. Personally, I think that there's enough talent and passion here that at least one of these teams, whether one of the leaders mentioned here, <a href="http://thelaunchpad.xprize.org/2010/12/checking-in-with-potential-google-lunar.html">one of the several that snuck in at the last minute</a>, or some other group altogether, will end up putting their flag on the Moon and help to usher in a new era of space exploration.
