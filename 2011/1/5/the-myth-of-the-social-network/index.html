                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                The ever interesting Jeremiah Owyang has a post up on his blog about <a href="http://www.web-strategist.com/blog/2009/09/07/help-my-boss-wants-to-be-my-friend-on-facebook/">what to do if your boss “friends” you on Facebook</a>. Now, it was made over a year ago, but I just saw it when he re-posted a link to it on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jowyang/status/22411202231541760">the twitterverse</a>. It brings up the interesting idea of what options are available in such a situation, and while I prefer to believe that a manager would <em>never</em> “friend” a subordinate — it would be a gigantic abuse of power — it’s highly likely to happen on a more and more frequent basis. While his advice is sound, even if I disagree with the conclusion, I think it’s perched on a dangerously false assumption: that we have but one social network.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <img src="http://assets.amber.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/social_networks.png" alt="A Venn diagram of three social networks: work, friends and family" title="Various social networks" width="227" height="191">Perhaps I am more than a smidgen old school, but I do not believe that my life has but one dimension to it. I do not believe that it has a single continuous social interaction stream. For me, I try to keep things partitioned up and carefully segregated for a few reasons I’ll go into. The major segments are in the nerdilicious Venn diagram to the right: work, friends and family. Now, some might scoff at the idea of keeping friends and family as two partially overlapping (or partially connected, if we are to use the more correct graph terminology) spheres of social interaction, but I believe that if we are honest with ourselves, that we will acknowledge that while we have friends and family, not all family are friends, and only some of your friends are family. It’s the nature of our relationships. If I am truthful, I even subdivide my friends into various groups. While they might all be equal in my affections, that does <em>not</em> imply that they are a fungible resource. The various subgroups often are not really compatible, and while that is partially a result of my slightly schizophrenic nature, I believe that if we examine closely, it is true for many.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The reasons for keeping these circles only partially intersecting are numerous, but eventually boil down to several rough guides. First, I generally keep my personal and professional life separate in order to be able to better manage people at work, and also to keep the inevitable drama to a minimum. Some might see this as harsh, as they treasure their “work friends”, but this is just my experience and personal preference. The second, and more difficult to explain, is that some groups of friends will never mix like a good vinaigrette. Instead, they’ll stay separated because of “lifestyle choices” that others might not approve of. Personally, I don’t care. Lastly, there are those that are separate through nothing more than the fact that my connection to a group of people is different, or encompasses a different set of interests, than another. It’s not a ranking of importance — all friends are important — but simply an acknowledgment of differences. With each of these groups I might share different aspects of my life and my personality, and so there’s no one stream of thoughts that fits them all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So there in lies the fallacy of “<em>the</em> social network”. There is not one, but a multitude which overlap and interlink one another in ways that are difficult to explain. So on Facebook, I might have family and friends, but I also have former peers in school and others who I am friendly toward, but who might not quite rate the rather overused and abused label of friend. It is this simplistic perception of our interconnectedness that I believe is also the root cause of the collapse of privacy engendered by sites like Facebook. Because there is but one term, friend, for everyone, we are encouraged to debase the term and apply it indiscriminately to many for whom it is a poor moniker. The person I am to my coworkers, my family and my friends — not to mention acquaintances — is not exactly the same. The emphasis is different, and the willingness to share is certainly very different.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Where then is this rambling post going? I’m not sure, but I believe we have devalued the idea of friendship in the Facebook era, and allowed ourselves to promote many to a level they are not yet deserving of, and by doing so devalued those who are. Some sites provide some modicum of control, or more likely the appearance of control, over what gets shared with who, but the reality is that the implementations are so slipshod, variable and unintuitive that their usefulness is minimal to most people.
