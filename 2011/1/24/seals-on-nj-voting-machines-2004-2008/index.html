                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                I have just released a new paper entitled <strong>"<a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/voting/SealsOnVotingMachines.pdf">Security seals on voting machines: a case study</a>"</strong> and here I'll explain how I came to write it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Like many computer scientists, I became interested in the technology of vote-counting after the technological failure of hanging chads and butterfly ballots in 2000. In 2004 I visited my local polling place to watch the procedures for closing the polls, and I noticed that ballot cartridges were sealed by plastic strap seals like this one:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <img width="200" alt="plastic strap seal" src="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/voting/strap-seal.jpg">
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The pollworkers are supposed to write down the serial numbers on the official precinct report, but (as I later found when <a href="http://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/nj-election-discrepancies-worse-previously-thought-contradict-sequoias-explanation">Ed Felten obtained dozens of these reports through an open-records request</a>), about 50% of the time they forget to do this:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <img width="400" src="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/voting/englewood-bw-excerpt.jpg">
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 2008 when (as the expert witness in a lawsuit) I examined the hardware and software of New Jersey's voting machines, I found that there were no security seals present that would impede opening the circuit-board cover to replace the vote-counting software. The vote-cartridge seal looks like it would prevent the cover from being opened, but it doesn't.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There was a place to put a seal on the circuit-board cover, through the hole labeled "DO NOT REMOVE", but there was no seal there:
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <img src="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/voting/do-not-remove.jpg">
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Somebody had removed a seal, probably a voting-machine repairman who had to open the cover to replace the batteries, and nobody bothered to install a new one.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The problem with paperless electronic voting machines is that if a crooked political operative has access to install fraudulent software, that software can switch votes from one candidate to another. So, in <a href="http://citp.princeton.edu/voting/advantage/">my report to the Court</a> during the lawsuit, I wrote,
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    <font face="times"><br>
                                    10.6. For a system of tamper-evident seals to provide effective protection, the seals must be consistently installed, they must be truly tamper-evident, and they must be consistently inspected. With respect to the Sequoia AVC Advantage, this means that <i>all five</i> of the<br>
                                    following would have to be true. But in fact, <i>not a single one</i> of these is true in practice, as I will explain.</font>
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The seals would have to be routinely in place at all times when an attacker might wish to access the Z80 Program ROM; but they are not.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The cartridge should not be removable without leaving evidence of tampering with<br>
                                        the seal; but plastic seals can be quickly defeated, as I will explain.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>The panel covering the main circuit board should not be removable without removing the [vote-cartridge] seal; but in fact it is removable without disturbing the seal.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>If a seal with a <i>different</i> serial number is substituted, written records would have to reliably catch this substitution; but I have found major gaps in these records in New Jersey.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Identical replacement seals (with duplicate serial numbers) should not exist; but the evidence shows that no serious attempt is made to avoid duplication.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Those five criteria are just common sense about what would be a required in any effective system for protecting something using tamper-indicating seals. What I found was that (1) the seals aren't always there; (2) even if they were, you can remove the cartridge without visible evidence of tampering with the seal and (3) you can remove the circuit-board cover without even disturbing the plastic-strap seal; (4) even if that hadn't been true, the seal-inspection records are quite lackadaisical and incomplete; and (5) even if that weren't true, since the counties tend to re-use the same serial numbers, the attacker could just obtain fresh seals with the same number!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since the time I wrote that, I've learned from the seal experts that there's a lot more to a <i>seal use protocol</i> than these five observations. I'll write about that in the near future.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But first, I'll write about the State of New Jersey's slapdash response to my first examination of their seals. Stay tuned.
                            </p>
