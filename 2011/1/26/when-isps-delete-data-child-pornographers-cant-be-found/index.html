                                Many Internet service providers keep records of user behavior—though not for long. The US government would, once again, like to change that by adopting some form of "data retention" requirement for ISPs. That's because, as Jason Weinstein of the Department of Justice put it today, "data retention is [now] fundamental to the Department’s work in investigating and prosecuting almost every type of crime."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There's no call yet for specifics, though the US surely has its eye on the (controversial) European model: ISPs must hang onto logs for at least six months but no more than two years. These "logs" are huge databases that grow exponentially as more devices access the Internet and do so for longer periods of time; there's a reason most ISPs only hang onto this information for a few months right now. After that, it's simply deleted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That's great for privacy. It's less great for cops who are, say, investigating a serious felony that occurred 91 days ago only to find that their trail has hit a dead end because the data was deleted on day 90.
                            </p>

                                Weinstein made this case to the House Judiciary Committee by way of an example:

                                    In a 2006 hearing before another committee in this House, an agent of the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation gave a heart-wrenching example of the harm that a lack of data retention can cause. He described how an undercover operation discovered a movie, depicting the rape of a two-year-old child that was being traded on a peer-to-peer file sharing network. Investigators were able to determine that the movie had first been traded four months earlier. So, investigators promptly sent a subpoena to the ISP that had first transmitted the video, asking for the name and address of the customer who had sent the video. The ISP reported that it didn’t have the records. Despite considerable effort, the child was not rescued and the criminals involved were not apprehended.

                                John Douglass of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, who spoke next, had an example of his own—this time a positive one of how important electronic data can be to an investigation.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    On July 26, 2006, 22 year old Tori Vienneau and her 10 month infant son, Dean were murdered in their 2 bedroom apartment in San Diego. Tori was found strangled in her living room and baby Dean was found strangled and hung from his crib in one of the adjoining bedrooms. This horrifying crime scene triggered an exhaustive 18 month investigation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The case was ultimately solved exclusively by the circumstantial evidence, including cell text message content and cell tower data from Verizon Wireless. The defendant denied any involvement in the killings and provided an intricate and extensive alibi.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Investigators focused their attention on Dennis Potts almost immediately because he was rumored to have had dinner plans with Tori on the night of her murder. Mr. Potts denied these rumors of dinner plans and the victim’s cell phone was examined for any text messages between the two of them supporting/refuting such rumors. In a most interesting twist, all incoming and outgoing text messages prior to 6:30 pm on the night of the killings had been deleted. The victim’s cell phone provider was contacted, but the text message content was not stored by the cell provider and therefore could not be recovered that way. Over the ensuing months, the victim’s phone was subjected to extensive forensic analysis in the hopes of recovering some of these messages.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The defendant’s cell phone carrier (Verizon Wireless) was also contacted and investigators were told incoming text message content (victim to defendant texts only) was preserved only for 3-5 days. In a stroke of good luck, this incoming data still existed and was preserved. It later proved to be pivotal in proving the defendant’s guilt. The text message content proved not only that the defendant lied to investigators and that the two did, in fact, have plans to meet that evening, but also that the defendant was checking to see if the victim and her son were alone in the apartment.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Verizon also provided the cell tower data for the defendant’s phone. This data, coupled with some additional testing, showed that the defendant’s alibi was false and he was not where he said he was. Furthermore, at the time of the killings, his cell phone “pinged” off of a cell tower only 500 yards from the victim’s apartment. This became the single most important piece of evidence linking the defendant to the killings and to his ultimate conviction in September, 2009.

                                ISPs and phone companies aren't overly excited by the idea of new retention rules. They say that they already work with investigators, and point out that police can ask at any time for a specific user's data to be preserved and it will be. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Kate Dean, who represented ISPs at the hearing, made clear that her industry "has come to the understanding that a blanket legal requirement to retain Internet usage data for established time periods is certain to present significant challenges to the communications industry, both for well-established companies and newer online media enterprises, as well as unintended consequences which are incapable of precise identification."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Instead, the ISPs could support "further opportunities to innovate around the preservation model" which targets specific users, rather than some requirement to store terabytes of information on every single subscriber.
                            </p>

                                Congress hasn't yet proposed specific legislation in this area, but the hearing suggests some might be coming. John Morris of the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology warned Congress about the privacy and free speech dangers of a lengthy retention mandate.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Mandatory data retention is a risky and costly path to go down," Morris concluded, "and one that is all the more problematic because once Congress opens the door to mandating that service providers amass huge tracking databases documenting citizensʼ Internet usage, it will be hard to close it. If Congress were to impose data retention on even just a narrow category of service providers, and even for a narrow category of crimes, there would be a strong and inevitable push to broaden the scope and reach of data retention. Congress should not cross this risky line."
