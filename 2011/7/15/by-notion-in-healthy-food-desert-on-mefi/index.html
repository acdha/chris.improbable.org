                        <blockquote>
                            <em>They simply get whatever is at hand. Which, you have to admit, could be classified as lazy.</em><br>
                            <br>
                            While my father was in prison, my step-mother was in charge of raising two kids who were in elementary school on $7 an hour, doing landscaping for a luxury resort. Her boss was cheap, so even if she worked more than 8 hours a day, she wouldn't get overtime. She had to accept that, or risk losing her job. I remember seeing weekly checks for not much over $200.<br>
                            <br>
                            We mostly ate pasta and hot dogs, and when gas went up, we didn't get any hot dogs. We ate cheap cereal, expired milk, canned vegetables, stale bread, and we were lucky. Her mother often lent money to help keep us fed, and took care of us on many afternoons. Without that, I'm pretty sure we wouldn't have made it, and we'd have to live in the projects again instead of the trailer park fifteen miles from the best school we lied to get into.<br>
                            <br>
                            (Have you ever rode a big wheel in a circle in a 10x10 room because it's too dangerous to play outside? Had a parent tell you to cover your ears, because the guy next door beating his wife half to death was too dangerous to call the cops on? At age six, seen a man give you a wink while he's getting a blowjob from a prostitute around the corner from your front door? Needless to say, staying away from the projects was a priority for our family.)<br>
                            <br>
                            My stepmother never complained to us, always tried to keep us busy. I know she slept with some men in a sugar daddy arrangement so we would have at least some toys, and I remember the day my father came home being so furious with her. She lied, she was a cheater, and my little sister and I had to keep it a secret forever. Which we have done; I haven't mentioned this to anyone until this moment. I found out later that she only allowed herself to cry in the shower, except for the two times she lost patience with us and spanked us and told us that she hated us. My grandmother on the other side of the family cried in the shower too.<br>
                            <br>
                            Whatever you may think about the poor, let me assure you that unless you've been there, unless you've gone hungry, or been mocked by other 8 year olds and then the teacher for your ratty tennis shoes, or seen opportunities fly by because your parents can't afford gas money to a better school; unless you've had to take an F on a test because you couldn't afford a #2 pencil and no one would give you one and your "teacher" decided to "teach" you a lesson; unless you've watched a cop beat the shit out of your dad because they didn't like him and his record meant they could do anything to him, or listened to a parent beg and plead and offer sex to a repoman for a little more time to keep their car so they could take you to school, you don't have any clue what the word lazy means.<br>
                            <br>
                            Poor people aren't worried about antioxidants and a balanced diet. They're worried about having water and electricity and heat in the winter. They are worried about how to miraculously make it through another week without losing their minds, or their children, or deciding to just give up the good fight, and spend their lives on welfare on the front porch with their neighbors, watching their kids give up too.<br>
                            <br>
                            Even the few who make it out with any kind of success have to claim that it was easy and anybody could do it. They have to blame laziness, or morality, or drugs, because the other choice is admitting that their society left them in the gutter without much of a chance of making it out.<br>
                            <br>
                            I thought I would make it out because my step-father's family is very wealthy. I've sat in well appointed dining rooms bigger than our entire trailer while educated, good hearted adults eating slabs of steak and fifty dollar bottles of wine complained about how they were being drained by Clinton's tax increases. It's a funny thing; they never offered to help. They didn't even help my step-father buy his first house over some decades old feud.<br>
                            <br>
                            I made it out because despite all of his flaws as an addict, my father knew it was important for me to learn how to read early on, and got my grandfather to buy me a computer at age 12. I landed my first job at 13 through a friend of my dad's -- who later refused to hire a man because he was black -- who basically paid me to learn how to use my computer to write invoices for his construction company. I made it out because before the construction industry collapsed again, my father was able to move us into a safe neighborhood. (He's now strung out back home, and I pay his rent when he's able to find a place that will keep him. But he's addicted to his pain meds -- his leg is bowed and his knee is gnarled from decades of work. He's still fighting red tape to get a new knee so he can get back to work at age 58, and calls me when he's drunk to tell me that he wants to die.) I made it out because my grandmother took me in when both of my parents were unable to care for me and kept me out of foster homes. I made it out because I'm a lower-middle class white guy, whose family had even the tiniest access to some money and sources of employment.<br>
                            <br>
                            I made it out because I was lucky.<br>
                            <br>
                            I'm still not sure what to do with it, or if I should or could do anything, but I'll be goddamned if I don't lose my mind every time I hear someone complain about the poor.
