                            <p>
                                One of the less-than-pleasant facts of life in quantum mechanics is that the act of measuring will change the item that has been measured. The reality is that we don't often run up against this limit. To use a poor analogy, current measurements are rather like dropping dynamite in a fish pond and then proudly reporting that the total number of live fish in the pond <em>was</em> 25, but, thanks to our very accurate measurement, we can state that the total number of live fish is now zero.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Less accurate, but less disruptive measurements would be better. But the ultimate is the measurement that delivers the maximum amount of information for the minimum amount of dead fish. (Okay, this analogy has gone on too long and, frankly, is starting to stink.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A group of researchers from France are reporting that they have <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature10225">developed</a> a system that comes a hell of a lot closer to achieving ideal quantum measurements. Better yet, it gives me the opportunity to tell you about the quantum bomb detector.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                The sadistic principle investigator and the light-detonated bomb
                            </h3>My day job is, in large part, devoted to making my grad students miserable because they are spending all their time in the lab. The important thing about laser labs is that they are dark when the students are working. My favorite way to ensure this is to put a bomb in the lab and fuse it with a light sensitive switch.
                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, my grad students are smarter than me and they always find out the bomb is there before setting foot in the lab. The way they do this is to enclose the lab in an optical cavity—an optical cavity is just two mirrors set up so that light reflects back and forth between them. The cool thing about this is that, even though the mirrors that make up the cavity might be 99.99 percent reflective, if my grad student chooses the light color and spatial distribution correctly, it can pass through the mirrors, into the cavity, and out the other side. No light will be reflected from these very high reflecting mirrors.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If there is a bomb in the cavity, then the properties of the optical cavity will be wrong, and the light can't get inside. My grad students simply look for light that gets&nbsp;reflected instead of entering the cavity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On observing some reflected light, they realize there's a bomb there, sigh, call me dirty names, and retire to the pub. There is a catch to this though. When the bomb is in the cavity, the mirrors are just mirrors and, since they're 99.99 percent reflective, one in every 10,000 photons will go through and set off the bomb, leaving me in search of a new lab and more grad students—use better mirrors next time, please.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                Can we get back to the science, please?
                            </h3>The point to that story is that my students' methods are perfectly analogous to what the group of French scientists have done. They want to be able to tell if a rubidium atom is in a particular state. To do this, they put it in an optical cavity and shine some light on it. If the rubidium atom is in one state, the light has the right wavelength to excite it to a higher energy state. If it's in the alternative state (the researchers carefully prepare the atom so that it is in one of two states), the light field can't excite the atom at all. The first case corresponds to having a bomb in the cavity, while the second corresponds to an empty cavity.
                            <p>
                                The researchers can then look at the reflected and transmitted light fields and determine with high accuracy which state the cavity is in. Better yet, when the atom is in the state that absorbs light, no light enters the cavity, meaning that you don't excite the atom and change its state.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now, the measurement still changes the state of the atom, because the electric field of the light causes the electrons to oscillate, changing the probability of the atom remaining in the state you just decided that it was in. It also changes a phase factor, which is normally unmeasurable, but becomes important when the atom is expected to interfere with another atom. (Interference in atoms involves physically transporting atoms "through" each other, which causes them to mutually modify the probability of finding an atom in a particular location—which is important for quantum computing.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This minimal interference only really applies if the experiment were perfect. As the researchers point out, their experiment is far from perfect, extracting about 100 times less information—in this case, information really means certainty about the state—than was theoretically possible. On the other hand, it is about two orders of magnitude better than previous work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Where to from here? Simple, make the experiment better. The nice thing is that all of this is done on a chip, so one can imagine having arrays of these cavities and little shuttles that transport individual atoms to and from measurement points after performing operations on an entire cloud of them. This would be a very cool way of looking at the detailed statistics of atomic clouds. And, of course, it is another nice tool for quantum computing with neutral atoms.
