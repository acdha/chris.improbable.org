                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://victualling.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mmedenaucase1913.jpg"><img title="mmedenaucase1913" src="http://victualling.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/mmedenaucase1913.jpg?w=261&amp;h=300" alt="" width="261" height="300"></a>In 1908 two women adventurers opened The Rose Tree Inn, a <a href="http://restaurant-ingthroughhistory.com/2008/07/24/roadside-restaurants-tea-shops/">tea room</a> in a 200-year old house in Northampton, Massachusetts. Both called themselves “Madame” and claimed to be related to European nobility by birth or marriage. They were used to supporting themselves and living by their wits. One, Anna [pictured], a widow, was a former British stage actress, while the other, Marie, who had an 11-year old son, was married to a criminally inclined soldier of fortune who masqueraded as a German baron and was exiled to a British penal colony.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Each had arrived in New York City from London in 1907 to cover the Harry Thaw murder trial for British papers. Almost immediately they became involved in what might be termed attempted “capers.” Madame Anna de Naucaze, 52, claimed she knew the secret to winning at roulette and could prove it if only someone would back her at Monte Carlo, while Madame Marie von Veltheim, about 38, said she had a treasure map showing where $4 million in gold was buried in mountains in South Africa’s Transvaal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Next they got in trouble with the courts for misappropriating a photo album that was evidence in the Thaw trial. The album contained photographs of Thaw’s wife Evelyn Nesbit who had been having an affair with Thaw’s victim, architect Stanford White. With a possible charge of larceny hanging over them, Anna returned the album to Thaw’s lawyer.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://victualling.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rosetreeinnsign.jpg"><img title="RoseTreeInnSign" src="http://victualling.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rosetreeinnsign.jpg?w=300&amp;h=199" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a>And then they went to Northampton. By comparison with their pasts, the small college town must have seemed dull. It’s not clear what drew them there, though if they were looking for a way to make money, they found it. The RTI, as it was known by its primary patrons, Smith College students, became a very popular place known for its sumptuous desserts and continental, “bohemian” atmosphere. Marie, who claimed to be the inn’s originator, stayed around until about 1913 when, after looking for a location for a new tea room, she evidently left for New York to “save her husband.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anna ran the tea room for the next 10 years, catering to students from Smith, Amherst College, and the Massachusetts Agricultural College. She took out advertisements as far away as Yale and also entertained visitors from her stage and literary past. She did well enough to warrant additions to the inn, one a screened-in section known as “the bird cage.” She opened two annexes in town, the Rose Tree Hut and the Rose Tree Den. At some point there was also a summer branch of the RTI in Old Orchard, Maine.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://victualling.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rtiadv1912.jpg"><img title="RTIadv1912" src="http://victualling.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/rtiadv1912.jpg?w=300&amp;h=233" alt="" width="300" height="233"></a>In addition to the attractions of delicious food and the quaint house with its old world charm, everyone was intrigued with the eccentric person of Anna herself, particularly because her gender was ambiguous. She dressed like a man and seemed mysterious. As one student put it, “Some say she is fleeing from justice, that she married a Frenchman and were greatly in debt so left France and came to America.” She was reported at various times to have been born in France, Belgium, and Russia. For several years she published a magazine called “4 All,” and she occasionally appeared in local theater productions. She was also known for writing her own humorous and folksy advertising copy, such as, “If you descend in an aëroplane we will be ready for you, but we much prefer to have you telephone.” According to a 1915 story about her, after business hours she spent evenings “alone with her dog and her revolver.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the early 1920s Anna fell afoul of Smith’s good graces over issues such as the inn’s cleanliness and reports that Smith students were smoking, and maybe drinking and meeting boys there. In 1923, when the college still had the power to control which off-campus restaurants students could patronize, the RTI was removed from the approved list. The RTI could not go on and, at age 69, Anna was deprived of her income. She lived in Maryland for a while but died in NYC in 1924. For many years later the building was occupied by the Rose Tree Filling Station.
