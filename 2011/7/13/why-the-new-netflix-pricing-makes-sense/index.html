Some <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/07/great-netflix-shaft">folks</a> are just <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TalkleftThePoliticsOfCrime/~3/Hi5D2iARhTg/515">angry</a>, and others <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/07/12/did-netflix-just-kill-its-long-tail-model/">like Felix Salmon</a> and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/07/7-reasons-why-netflixs-price-hike-is-a-bonehead-move/241869/">David Indiviglio</a> predict that this will hamper the company’s long-term strategy and investor confidence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I disagree. Netflix has always been under-priced. Likely they purposefully under-priced their service to draw in as wide a customer base as possible – to get people hooked, essentially – before raising rates to a sustainable level. And really, that’s all Netflix is doing, raising prices to a level at which they can maintain profitability. Netflix already <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKNWagUjdrs">eats up 30% of domestic peak time downstream bandwidth</a>. Both the streaming and delivery service cost a lot money, and at the previous rates they were basically giving it away for free.  Realistically, that can’t last. Now that major competitors are out of the picture, it won’t last.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And people will keep paying. Or, rather, people who use both services will keep paying for both and people who just get DVD’s in the mail will keep paying for mail delivery. Streaming-only may be a different story. Netflix will have to offer more quality titles to sell the streaming-only service.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It would be nice to see the company revive some cancelled shows like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)">Firefly</a> and produce new seasons for their streaming customers. Original content could go a long way toward justifying the streaming only service. But whatever their long-term plan might be, even the higher rates undercut a trip to the rental store. Walking to your mailbox or turning on your PC is still far more convenient even at $20 a month.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.redbox.com">Redbox</a> is a cheap alternative, but you still have to drive down to the store to get a movie, possibly wait in line, and pay by the day if you’re late. <a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a> isn’t really a competitor so much as it’s a complimentary service. The two online venues have very different offerings. In our family, we subscribe to both. Often newer shows are available on Hulu Plus that aren’t available on Netflix, but older seasons are available on Netflix without the commercials.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even at the higher Netflix rates, subscribing to the streaming + 2 DVD plan <em>and</em> Hulu Plus is cheaper than subscribing to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/01/06/news/companies/cable_bill_cost_increase/index.htm">basic cable</a> plus DVD rentals. With the online and mail plans you get to dictate what you watch and when, and there are fewer commercials.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So no, I doubt this will hurt Netflix at all even if the move was not handled as gracefully as it could have been. If anything, a few angry customers will leave, but more will come (or come back) regardless of the higher prices, as long as Netflix continues to offer fast delivery and quality service. And why shouldn’t they? With <em>real</em> prices in place and the ability to expand their offering domestically and abroad, Netflix is in as good a position as ever to win the future, so to speak.
