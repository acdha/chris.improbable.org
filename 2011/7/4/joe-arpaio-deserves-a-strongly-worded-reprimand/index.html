                            <p>
                                <strong>By Thoreau</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The LA Times is reporting that <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-lapd-reprimand-20110704,0,6772068.story">LAPD officers who engage in serious misconduct will not be suspended without pay</a>.  Instead, they will receive a strongly-worded letter informing them that the next time they do it get caught they will face very severe penalties.  Meanwhile, <a href="http://c4ss.org/content/7658">the good anarchists at the Center for a Stateless Society</a> note that <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/2011/07/03/20110703tent-city-temperatures-rise-145.html">Joe Arpaio is keeping prisoners (convicted of non-violent offenses) in tents that reach 145 degrees Fahrenheit</a>, the temperature at which meat is considered cooked.  I think somebody needs to send Arpaio a strongly-worded letter for these human rights violations!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Or send him some <a href="http://art-bin.com/art/omodest.html">Irish babies</a> to feed the prisoners.  They’ll cook perfectly in the 145 degree heat.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, on the subject of police behavior, when Whitey Bulger was arrested <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/2011/06/24/officer-safety/">Radley Balko noted that the cops didn’t send in SWAT to break down his door</a>.  They tricked him into exiting the building and arrested him outside.  It seems that the SWAT teams don’t want to go into a structure controlled by a genuinely dangerous person who has guns and knows the layout.  They’d rather limit the “dynamic entries” to drug raids.  I’m reminded of an incident a few months ago when my nephew’s school was in lockdown because the cops got a report that there was a man threatening a murder-suicide in a house across the street from the school.  The cops did NOT rush through the door with stun grenades.  Instead, they surrounded the place and tried to make contact with the person inside.  Thankfully, it turned out that the call was a hoax and nobody was inside the house, but it’s striking that when the cops had reason to suspect that a person might be in danger they did NOT take immediate action.  They kept their cool, tried to communicate, and tried to defuse the situation.  Somehow, though, a report of a bag of pot requires immediate use of force.
