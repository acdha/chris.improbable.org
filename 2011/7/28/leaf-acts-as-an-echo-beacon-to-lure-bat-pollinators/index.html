                                As a Pallas’s long-tongued bat flies around a rainforest looking for nectar, it relies on echolocation from the sound it emits to find flowers. From a plant’s perspective, it's good to be found by bats, which are highly mobile pollinators. But how can a plant stand out among the sea of foliage in a rainforest?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A recent paper in <em>Science</em> reveals that the vine <em>Marcgravia evenia</em> from the Cuban rainforest has evolved to catch a bat's attention by producing one to two dish-shaped leaves near its flowers. These dish-shaped leaves stand upright and point the concave side toward nectar-feeding pollinators. The dimensions of the leaves make them an acoustic beacon for bats.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The dish-shaped leaves (51mm x 35mm and 13mm deep) are quite different from typical floral leaves (74mm x 28mm, 3mm deep), and this difference translates into drastically different echo properties. The relatively flat foliage leaf produces the strongest echoes directly from the front, but the echo strength tapers off significantly as you move away laterally. In contrast, dish-shaped leaves have strong echoes that stay pretty consistent across a 120° arc. This means that the echo of dish-shaped leaves can be detectable within a volume of roughly 25m<sup>3</sup>, compared to 15m<sup>3</sup> for foliage leaves.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The echoes from dish-shaped leaves would also have an acoustic signature that's distinct from background foliage echoes. The echo impulse responses, as measured by a biomimetic sonar head, show that the echoes from dish-shaped leaves do not vary spatially. That is the echoes barely change in amplitude and frequency over a wide range of directions. This should make the dish-shaped leaves stand out to passing bats, as echoes from foliage leaves vary drastically with direction change.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In experiments with actual bats, researchers placed a single feeder within artificial foliage and measured how long it would take bats (<em>Glossophaga soricina</em>) to find the feeder. When there are no leaves present on the feeder, the bats took about 23.2 seconds. When there is a foliage leaf on the feeder, it took the bats 22.0 seconds. With a dish-shaped leaf on the feeder, the bats only needed 12.3 seconds to locate the feeder. Thus, the dish-shaped leaf acts as a beacon to bats.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dish-shaped leaves attract nectar-seeking bats in the New World tropics (North, Central, and South Americas) in the same way that bright flowers attract birds. It’s interesting to note that there are pollinating bats in the Old World tropics (Africa, Asia, and Europe) that do not rely on echolocation to find nectar—those bats find flowers with their eyes. If there is a co-evolutionary relationship between dish-shaped leaves and bats, flowers that rely on bats for pollination in the Old World tropics should lack those leaves, as there would be no evolutionary advantage to having them.
