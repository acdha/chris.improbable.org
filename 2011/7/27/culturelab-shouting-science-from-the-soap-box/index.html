                                What makes crows smart? Can Twitter help us improve software? What has space got to do with me? Is there a smarter way to monitor biodiversity?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Damn fine questions. But they don't hold a candle to this one: just what were 12 women in white coats doing on a blustery Friday afternoon, on soap boxes, at the heart of London's South Bank?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was the second outing for <a href="http://www.zsl.org/science/events/soapbox-science,539,EV.html">Soapbox Science</a>, an event that takes an in-your-face approach to public science communication. There the women were, with nothing more than a sunflower, a few bat headsets - designed to give you the experience of eco-location - and some large boards, to help them withstand the cruel whims of the passing trade.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But this steely crew of top scientists chosen by organisers Nathalie Pettorelli and Seirian Sumner of the <a href="http://www.zsl.org/">Zoological Society of London</a> (ZSL), and the <a href="http://www.womeninscience.co.uk/">L'Or√©al-UNESCO For Women in Science Programme</a> was undeterred from their mission: to challenge the public's view of women and science.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That they did. Despite the L'Oreal lab coats (OK, let's get it over with: "Because They're Worth It") passers-by were quickly engaged with the actual science.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For nearly four hours, the public tuned in to bravura performances of all types: from space scientist <a href="http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&amp;id=00000002323">Maggie Aderin-Pocock</a> of University College London (UCL) taking a tour of the universe via the sun's hotspots, to Cambridge professor of comparative cognition <a href="http://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/pages/staffweb/clayton/">Nicola Clayton</a>'s well-rehearsed show about the minds of crows to the politically charged <a href="http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/people/n.chayen/">Naomi Chayen</a>'s discussion of crystals and new medicines. (The politics were not too surprising considering she's at the sharp end of medicines development at Imperial College London.)

                                Bat lady <a href="http://www.zsl.org/science/ioz-staff-students/jones,1087,AR.html">Kate Jones</a> of the Zoological Society of London had people going batty, literally. They stumbled around blindfolded in headsets equipped with echolocation devices - so they could see what it felt like to be bats for a few minutes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was great stuff, if a bit disturbing, and I did learn that it's really hard to distinguish between bat calls (try the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibats/id426795283?mt=8">Ibats</a> app) in 2D. Jones wants to build a 3D model of bat calls in order to make it easier.

                                But of all of the scientists spouting from soapboxes, my favourite had to be quiet, but utterly steely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoline_Leyser">Ottoline Leyser</a>, professor of plant development at Cambridge. Clutching a fine sunflower as her only prop, she took serious issue with the way we see the world. We think plants do nothing when they're actually very, very busy; we are seduced by the obvious movement of animals. As for couch potatoes - don't get her started...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Maybe, just maybe, getting up on a soap box and talking about complex science and tech is a step toward normalising the sight of women in science - and perhaps challenging the notion of science as the realm set apart for beardy-nerdy blokes. And maybe it might encourage us all to question why so many fine young women are deterred from pursuing science to begin with.
