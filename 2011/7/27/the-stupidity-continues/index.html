                                Mother criminally charged for illegally boarding a school bus . . . <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/07/perry_county_mother_charged_wi.html">because she thought her kid was dying</a>.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Other kids were standing over the kindergartner’s assigned seat, yelling that Xander was slumped over.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “Help, he’s not moving,” she recalled during a recent court hearing. “We can’t wake him up.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So she ran to the bus, up the steps and to the landing. The driver told her she couldn’t get on the bus. It’s against the law.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Keener kept going. “My focus was on my son,” she told a judge.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What happened on that bus Dec. 15 has earned Keener a misdemeanor charge of unlawfully entering a school bus. She’s now awaiting trial in Perry County Court.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The bus company remembers the story a little differently, and reported the incident — as they are required by law — to the state police because the driver asked Keener to leave the bus and she refused.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    They say no one was screaming ‘help,’ that Xander was sleeping, like he had before and the driver wasn’t given enough time to handle the situation herself.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “Everyone’s focused on, he wasn’t really sick,” said Keener’s attorney Jeffrey B. Engle. “How do you know that? He could be choking on a Jolly Rancher. I can hop a fence to save someone who is drowning, even if it says ‘Keep Out’ if the harm sought to be avoided is greater than the possible violation of the crime.”
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Keener faces up to a year in jail and a $2,500 fine. The prosecutor says the bus company urged him to press charges. The bus company denies that. But here’s the best line by the idiot prosecutor:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    “Most parents aren’t a problem, but what do you do when a … sex offender wants to get on the bus and get his kids off? We need to have that protection in place.”
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                He’s right. I mean, you let this one mother who thought her kid was dying duck the law, and the next you thing you know, sex offenders will be coaching their kids to fake choking and heart attacks, so they can board buses full of children under the guise of an emergency, and then, and then . . . and then, what? . . . quickly molest all the children before anyone notices?
                            </p>
