                                If you talk to business travelers above a certain age, they’ll tell you about the good old days of airline travel. Airports used to be less crowded, the food was better, the service was more attentive, and the stewardesses were more attractive. This was because price controls kept fares high, and airlines competed for passengers with generous perks. The situation was great for the small minority of rich people and business travelers who could afford it because they didn’t have to deal with the <em>hoi polloi</em> clogging up the airports. But it sucked for everyone else, for whom an airplane flight was a rare luxury.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the late 1970s, the law was changed to allow airlines to give consumers what they actually wanted, which was mostly lower prices. As fares fell, the airlines dropped most of the frills that once came with an airplane ticket. Today the food isn’t as good, service is mediocre and airports feature long lines and screaming children. But a lot more people can afford to fly home and visit their families, which is what’s really important.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This came to mind as I was reading <a href="http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2011/07/blogging-is-legacy-technology-the-proof.html">Jonathan Rauch’s latest</a>:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Every time someone who could have done good science does sloppy science, or does worse journalism instead of better journalism, or mediocre writing instead of fine writing, it’s a loss. When resources are scarce—and of course human talent is the most scarce and precious resource of all—it matters if blogging is inducing ADD in many of our best writers and thinkers, or driving talent away altogether.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I watch with growing concern as young journalists get channeled into content mills where they post three, seven, who knows how many blog snippets a day. I spoke with one young guy who told me he puts up seven posts a day and would like to break into longer form by doing only three. One of the most promising young journalists I know couldn’t take it and quit for medical school. Another young writer tells me he longs to “get off the hamster wheel.”
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                As I <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/timothylee/2011/07/12/the-social-media-singularity/">mentioned</a> last week, Jonathan Rauch is old enough to remember the pre-Internet media world. Because media outlets had few competitors, they tended to be extremely profitable. As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/opinion/18Cohen.html">Roger Cohen</a> and <a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2009/05/19/the-old-time-and-the-new-newsweek/">John Podhoretz</a> have written, this allowed them to offer their writers a variety of perks that are hard to come by today, including a generous salary and a light schedule that allowed them to put a lot of time and effort into each story.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s not hard to see why Rauch would want to return to that world, just as some business travelers wish they could go back to the 1970s. But it’s important to remember that the declining fortunes of elite publications is inextricably linked to the democratization of publishing. Incumbent publications are having trouble making ends meet because they’re facing a lot more competition than they used to. And that competition is a direct consequence of the fact that everyone now has a freedom to write for a national audience.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It would be silly to deny that this has disadvantages. The <em>New York Times</em> really does do good work, and it’s been sad to see them lay people off. Writers now have to work harder to make a living and sometimes they’re tempted to cut corners. There really is a lot more “sloppy science” and “mediocre writing” than there used to be.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But the collapsing barriers to entry has also had tremendous benefits. In 1990, if you didn’t snag a coveted job at a national publication, you essentially didn’t get to be a writer at all. Today, anyone can have a blog. This has made the national conversation livelier, richer, and more interactive. It has created opportunities for people with non-traditional backgrounds to reach readers who are intensely interested in what they have to say. People with deep interests in niche subjects—linguistics, feminism, patent law, knitting—have access to an unprecedented range of material on their favorite subjects.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is an issue I take personally because I’m probably one of the riff raff who wouldn’t have made the cut in the pre-Internet media ecosystem. The publication I <a href="http://arstechnica.com/author/timothy-b-lee/">do most of my writing for</a> could only exist online. It has thin margins and asks its writers to turn stories around relatively quickly. Maybe Rauch would look down his nose at the work we do.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’d love to have a job at a publication that gave me weeks to work on a story, but so far none of them has offered me a job. And indeed, no conceivable economic system could offer that kind of job to everyone who wants one. The great thing about the Internet is that you don’t need a job at one of those publications to write about topics of public concern. This is understandably irritating to longtime members of the profession that used to hold a lucrative monopoly on soapboxes. But in my view the increase in freedom for everyone else is an overwhelmingly positive development.
