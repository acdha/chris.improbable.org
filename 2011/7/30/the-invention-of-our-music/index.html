                                    Never has there been a more revolutionary moment in the history of “classical” music. It was the work of a man known today as Guido of Arezzo in the early eleventh century; and so effective was his creation that we still use it unchanged today. We take staff notation for granted now, but in its time it transformed the lives of everyone concerned with music-making in the religious houses, since they no longer had to memorize the whole corpus of chant needed for the church’s year—a fabulous amount of material by the year 1000.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So long did the old process of memorization take (“from earliest youth until the hoariness of old age,” in the words of Bishop Agobard of Lyon) that it was blamed for lowering the standards of the communal life lived by these monks: instead of tending the garden of their souls, they spent countless hours in mechanical learning by heart. Nor were they necessarily thanked for their efforts. Guido himself thought singers to be “the most foolish of men” because their greatest labors were likely to produce the smallest results. So it was that Guido’s stave—a kind of graph, derived, perhaps, from the counting board or abacus—not only meant that a lifetime’s work could be condensed into two years study, it was also deliberately intended by Guido to help clean up the contemporary church, especially from the besetting sin of simony.
