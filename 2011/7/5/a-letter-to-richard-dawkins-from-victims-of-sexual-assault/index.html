                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                I have mentioned before that I am a rape survivor.  And that is why I was horrified to see Richard Dawkins display <a title="Shakesville has a nice timeline" href="http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2011/07/point-you-are-proving-it.html">an amazing amount of ignorance and victim-blaming</a> over the last week.  I asked Stephanie Svan to help me put into words what I was feeling, and the result is below.  If you wish to have your name added to this letter, visit <a href="http://almostdiamonds.blogspot.com/2011/07/letter-to-professor-dawkins-from.html">Almost Diamonds</a> for the original post.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have added a photo of me from that time period.  <em>[edited to add--have removed photo of me at age 18, since some people have copied it and been innapropriate.]</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is the face of “shutting up” and trusting, Professor Dawkins. This is a photo of a girl starting down the road of science. Within 2 weeks of arriving at college, she learned that women in science have a lot more to deal with than just nasty chemistry lab partners.  I almost flunked out my first year of school–and yet amazingly, it was not until years later that I realized that my assault was probably the reason.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Why? Because I was so deeply enmeshed in a culture that wanted me to shut up and be nice to men–<strong>which you are promoting and supporting with your comments</strong>– that I didn’t know what to do when a boy invited himself into my apartment.   And why I kept trying to be polite and asking “Please don’t do that.”  And why I thought for many years that what happened was my fault.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is why I am so very unhappy and feeling betrayed by you.   Stephanie says this in a much more moderated way; I just wanted you to hear from me directly, in addition as a signatory to this letter.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Comments here will be moderated as I see fit.  Do not even think of trying to mansplain this to me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Letter:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    <em>Dear Dick:</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>At your request, we write to you to tell you what it is that you do not understand about elevators, invitations, and sexual assault. Who are we, and why are we in any position to tell you anything? We are atheists and skeptics, but more relevantly, we are victims of sexual assault.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>There are two important things to note about Rebecca Watson’s experience. The first is that she had spent much of her evening telling the people around her, “Please don’t hit on me,” and finished by saying she was done talking and wanted sleep. This was ignored by the man now widely referred to as Elevator Guy. (Yes, it’s been established that he was in a position to hear her. Yes, it’s been established that he followed her out of the space in which she’d been saying this and got on the elevator with her.)</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>She had said, by unequivocal implication, “No.” He ignored this and did what he wanted to. This is important.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>The second important thing to know is that her response was to say publicly, one more time, “Please don’t do that. It makes me uncomfortable.” That’s it. That was her entire response to Elevator Guy beyond telling him she wouldn’t go to his room.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>For that response, Rebecca came under considerable fire. This is also important.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>The entire drama-filled discussion came about because Rebecca asserted her right and the right of other women to say, “No,” and be heard. It happened because she asserted that men, as well as women, have a role to play in maintaining that right.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>Then you spoke. Then you, widely regarded as one of atheism’s leaders, one of the Four Horsemen, decided you needed to say something about this.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>You didn’t have to do that. If you felt, as your comments seem to indicate, that too much attention was being paid to this event, you could have simply declined to add yours.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>However, that wasn’t what you did. Instead, you said that Rebecca, who was voicing our concerns, was thereby telling other women with other concerns that they were whining. Or perhaps that the rest of us who supported Rebecca when she was criticized for expressing her preferences were accusing these women of whining.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>Even if you had stopped there, this would merit an apology. Not only has Rebecca spoken out loudly against female genital mutilation (drawing the ire of those who told her she wasn’t paying enough attention to the boys) and other religion-driven wrongs against women and girls, but her demand that women’s self-determination be respected is exactly what needs to spread in order to prevent the ills you mention. If this is an issue you care about, instead of a distraction from Rebecca’s point, you should be thanking her for her work instead of emphasizing the “chick” in the name of her organization, diminishing her stature.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>Then, in response to complaints about that, you told us all that what happened to Rebecca–having her clearly and repeatedly expressed preferences about being hit on ignored–was “zero bad.” It should be clear by now why that requires a correction from you. It also calls for another apology, whether or not you knew the facts above when you wrote your comment. If you didn’t know, you weren’t in any state to lend your position and reputation to any characterization of what happened, much less the mischaracterization you used.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>That is where you injured us, the victims. You have made one more space blatantly unsafe to us. We don’t mean safe as in free from any kind of sexual interest. We’re not asking for that, and we don’t want it. We mean that you, a leader in our community, made free with a woman’s experience and rewrote it to suit your own ends.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>You decided you knew better than she did what had happened, and you were comfortable explaining it to everyone else. That is part of how communities are ruined and ultimately shaped to support sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape. That is how offenders operate and how they are excused. That is how the world that hurt us was built. And you have added to that.</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <em>That is why you owe us an apology as much as you owe Rebecca. When may we expect it?</em>
                                </p>
                                <p>
