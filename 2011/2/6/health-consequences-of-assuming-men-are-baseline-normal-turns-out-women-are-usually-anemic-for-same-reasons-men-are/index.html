                                Oh this is great! I've mentioned elsewhere the insights that can be gained from dropping the assumption that (relatively affluent, anglo-euro, military-age) men are the neutral baseline against which all other humanity should be measured. It's a great way to <a href="http://www.realadultsex.com/content/work-worthiness-and-turning-79-cents-dollar-its-head">reveal otherwise invisible ways gender construction affect men</a>. Well, here's Kate Clancy laying out a just plain classic example where assuming men are the baseline screws women.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And without forgetting that we really are talking about a rather dangerous assumption that women's iron levels vary (because they have periods) while men remain constant (because they don't), what I'm really excited about is how nicely the charts illustrate the point: they show one thing when you assume men are the baseline, something else entirely different. And in this case more medically true and medically <em>useful!</em> (All emphasis hers.)

                                    However, the sex difference in iron status in males and females derives from an <strong>increase</strong> in male iron stores at puberty, not a <strong>decrease</strong> in female iron stores. This has to do with oxygen transport and testosterone (Bergstrom et al 1995). This means that the difference that occurs at puberty actually looks like this:

                                    Second, the main culprit for iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in men is upper-gastrointestinal bleeding, so when men present with IDA the first thing they do is an endoscopy. When women present with IDA they give her iron supplements and tell her to go home because it's just her ladybusiness. Kepczyk et al (1999) decided to actually do endoscopies on women for whom a gynecological source was diagnosed by a specialist for their IDA. They found a whopping <strong>eighty-six percent</strong> of these women had a gastrointestinal disease that was likely causing their IDA. Therefore, menses likely had nothing to do with their IDA, and the assumption that menses made them pathological actually obstructed a correct diagnosis.

                                    <strong>The majority of the women in that study were bleeding internally, and no one had figured it out until then because they had periods.</strong>

                                The post is important because it illustrates the way <em>extremely</em> old gendered assumptions meant no one bothered to check for what would otherwise be an obvious and parallel reason for anemia in women.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But what I really like is how those two charts illustrate what happens when you drop that  assumption. As soon as you switch the frame of reference suddenly men are the variable. And looking at the second chart we're <em>really variable!</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This isn't just significant for reasons of gender-blind assumptions. You look at the second chart and suddenly a sex-specific illness like <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/hemochromatosis/overview.html">hemochromatosis in men</a> stops looking so inexplicable: after puberty men's hemoglobin levels start to spike upwards.  There might be advantages but past a certain point iron levels can too high.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That's still kind of academic compared to the consequences of neglecting to consider GI bleeding in women. If women are already "borderline anemic" (now a.k.a. "normal") then identifying and dealing with significant causes like that instead of assuming along with Aristotle that a couple of teaspoons of undiluted blood lost in menses was making the difference. (Hello? Even though donating a whole pint in 20 minutes doesn't?)
