                            <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/02/genomic-analysis-shows-humans-evolved-with-few-sweeping-changes.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss"><img vspace="4" hspace="4" border="0" align="right" width="230" height="129" src="http://static.arstechnica.net/assets/2010/03/fossil_skull_ars-thumb-230x130-12836-f.jpg"></a>
                            <p>
                                Humans and chimpanzees split around five million years ago. Ever since then, we (and they) have changed a bit to adapt to the different environments we invaded and created, and the "classic selective sweep" model was widely thought to account for these changes at the molecular level. In <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2006/11/5909.ars">this scenario</a>, a new, strongly beneficial mutation increases in frequency so rapidly that it "sweeps" away all other variants at that gene and nearby sites. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yet it is difficult to detect the evidence of such sweeps in genomic data. After analyzing 179 human genomes, an international team of researchers have concluded that these sweeps were much rarer than previously thought, and were therefore probably not a huge influence on human adaptation over the past 250,000 years. Their work is reported in <em>Science</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sweeps were thought to be common for two reasons. First, genetic diversity is low around regions encoding human-specific amino acid substitutions and noncoding regulatory sites, which are presumed to be important in adaptation. And second, regions of low recombination—where the rarity of exchanges between chromosomes ensures that a single sweep would cover a larger span—do in fact have lower diversity than regions of higher recombination. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Statistical analyses based on the sweeps model have identified 2000 genes as potential sites of selection, and have suggested that the genetic diversity in as much as ten percent of the human genome can be attributed to recent sweeps. But there are other explanations for these patterns of genetic variation, which can be due to many modes of natural selection, as well as demographic factors. And there are only a few known, functionally characterized instances of genetic adaptation in humans.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To assess the role sweeps have had in shaping human genetic diversity, Hernandez et al. looked at 179 genomes collected as part of the 1000 Genomes Project. These represent four distinct populations: Utah residents with northern and western European ancestry; Japanese from Tokyo; Han Chinese in Beijing; and Yoruba from Ibidan, Nigeria. The three populations with Eurasian ancestry are thought to have split from the Yoruba more than 100,000 years ago and from each other about 23,000 years ago, so any sweeps would cause extreme differences in alleles between the populations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They found that, in contrast to predictions of the sweep model, lows in diversity around human-specific changes that affect protein sequences are the same depth as those around synonymous substitutions, those in which the DNA changes that do not cause changes in a protein. In addition, genetic regions coding for proteins and noncoding regulatory regions are not very different among the four populations. They conclude that few human-specific amino acid changes, and therefore little of human evolution, resulted from classic sweeps.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is the scientific method at its best. The classic sweep model seemed consistent with the available data until the recent technological advances allowed the sequencing of many human genomes. The authors used this new information to reveal the inadequacies of the current model, and note that new tests must be devised to detect the actual genetic mechanisms that drove human adaptation. They suggest that Genome Wide Association studies should be immensely useful in this regard.
