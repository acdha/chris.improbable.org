U.S. District Judge Larry Burns said in the order that he expects a trial to begin before Sept. 20. Loughner, 22, is the alleged gunman in the Jan. 8 shooting that authorities call an assassination attempt on U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.

As before, this is not a prohibition on criticism, vituperation, and all those other good things; just a recognition that there's all the difference in the world between passionately disagreeing with someone and calling for that person's death.

And in fact Thomas Jefferson said it's good for a country to have a revolution every 20 years.

I'll tell you the first thing we need to do is take Harry Reid out.

Bobby Bright</a>. The ad features Barber conferring with--well, ranting at--George Washington, Samuel Adams, and Ben Franklin. He opens with talk of impeaching Obama and goes on about the IRS and the progressive tax code. Noting that the ghostly trio revolted over a tea tax, he says things have gotten much worse and that he won't "stand by while these evils are perpetrated." (At one point the former Marine points to a piece of parchment that he says he swore to defend with his life; presumably he's referring to the Constitution, but close examination reveals the document he's pointing to is the Declaration of Independence--oh well, close enough I suppose.)

                                        1) Republicans not only want to reduce women's access to abortion care, they're actually trying to redefine rape. After a major backlash, they promised to stop. But they haven't yet. Shocker.
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin:1em 0pt 1em 40px">
                                        2) A state legislator in Georgia wants to change the legal term for victims of rape, stalking, and domestic violence to "accuser." But victims of other less gendered crimes, like burglary, would remain "victims."
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin:1em 0pt 1em 40px">
                                        3) In South Dakota, Republicans proposed a bill that could make it legal to murder a doctor who provides abortion care. (Yep, for real.)
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin:1em 0pt 1em 40px">
                                        4) Republicans want to cut nearly a billion dollars of food and other aid to low-income pregnant women, mothers, babies, and kids. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin:1em 0pt 1em 40px">
                                        5) In Congress, Republicans have a bill that would let hospitals allow a woman to die rather than perform an abortion necessary to save her life.
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin:1em 0pt 1em 40px">
                                        6) Maryland Republicans ended all county money for a low-income kids' preschool program. Why? No need, they said. Women should really be home with the kids, not out working.
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin:1em 0pt 1em 40px">
                                        7) And at the federal level, Republicans want to cut that same program, Head Start, by $1 billion. That means over 200,000 kids could lose their spots in preschool.
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin:1em 0pt 1em 40px">
                                        8) Two-thirds of the elderly poor are women, and Republicans are taking aim at them too. A spending bill would cut funding for employment services, meals, and housing for senior citizens.
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin:1em 0pt 1em 40px">
                                        9) Congress just voted for a Republican amendment to cut all federal funding from Planned Parenthood health centers, one of the most trusted providers of basic health care and family planning in our country.
                                    </p>
                                    <p style="margin:1em 0pt 1em 40px">
                                        10) And if that wasn't enough, Republicans are pushing to eliminate all funds for the only federal family planning program. (For humans. But Republican Dan Burton has a bill to provide contraception for wild horses. You can't make this stuff up).

We demand investment, to create decent jobs for the millions of people who desperately want to work. And we demand that the rich and powerful pay their fair share.
