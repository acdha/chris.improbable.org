                            <p>
                                Last week Chicago experienced its <a href="http://www.chicagoweathercenter.com/severe/chicago-snow/chibrknews-blizzard-of-2011-5th-snowiest-and-counting-20110202,0,7053742.story">third-largest blizzard</a> on record. When we came into the newsroom on Monday morning, forecasters were warning us that it a big one was on the way. Our team considered various ways we could contribute to covering the story and decided to focus on implementating a variation on the <a href="http://snowmageddoncleanup.com/">Snowmageddon Cleanup</a> project originally launched by <a title="PICnet" href="http://www.picnet.net/">PICnet</a> with the Washington Post in the wake of the February 2010 DC blizzard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Put simply, Snowmageddon Cleanup is a tool meant to help connect people who need shovels with people who have them. The tool is built on an open source application called <a href="http://www.ushahidi.com/">Ushahidi</a> which drew much attention after it was <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2010/01/14/ushahidi_brings/">deployed to help with crisis response after the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti</a>. The Ushahidi team provides a hosted solution at <a href="http://crowdmap.com/">Crowdmap.com</a> which makes setting up an instance quite easy, so we spent Monday configuring a basic setup modeled off of Snowmageddon Cleanup hosted at <a href="http://chicagosnow.crowdmap.com/">ChicagoSnow.CrowdMap.com</a>. While we were setting up, our friend <a title="MCIC Staff: Justin Massa" href="http://mcic3.mcfol.org/aboutus.aspx#&amp;&amp;m=65&amp;s=staff">Justin Massa</a> of the <a href="http://mcic3.mcfol.org/index.aspx">Metro Chicago Information Center</a> volunteered to help with administration and outreach, including asking MCIC intern Resney Gugwor to serve as a report moderator as well. <a href="http://www.mookytech.com/deborahshaddon/">Deborah Shaddon</a>, the Chicago city lead for <a href="http://crisiscommons.org/">CrisisCommons</a>, also found us and introduced us to a number of enthusiastic volunteers from the wider community.

                                On Tuesday we configured our CrowdMap to accept reports by email and SMS in addition to the web form, and we worked with our colleagues around the Tribune to publicize the service.&nbsp; By midnight on our first day we’d approved 192 reports, and many more came in overnight. Things really picked up speed at the end of the workday on Wednesday: as our team went home and left the administration unattended for a couple of hours, more than 200 reports came in. We rallied the troops and spent the evening approving reports and looking for any reports which seemed to merit some kind of additional follow-up (more on that later), set up a project twitter handle (<a href="http://twitter.com/ChiSnowMap">@ChiSnowMap</a>), and wondered what we’d gotten ourselves into.

                                Thursday brought another nearly 300 reports, although spaced out more evenly through the day.&nbsp; By Sunday morning when we disabled submission of new reports, we had received about 1,100 reports, of which 1,053 were approved and posted on the site.

                                We were excited that so many Chicagoans heard about the map and chose to use it to report issues, offer help, and tell stories of “victories”. However, looking back, it’s hard to gauge just how much help the system provided. Here are a few things we’ve identified which we will do differently if we do something like this again.
                            </p>
                            <h3>
                                More Partners
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Erik Hersman, one of the creators of Ushahidi, <a href="http://whiteafrican.com/2010/08/12/making-ushahidi/">observed that technology was only 10% of their solution</a>. That sounds about right, especially because in our case we had only to do minimal configuration of an existing tool. In the future, we’d like to work more closely with government agencies, other media organizations, and independent civic groups to be more sure of connecting all the dots.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Specifically, even if we work more closely with the city, I don’t think we are going to be dispatching plows based on crowd reports. Streets &amp; Sanitation has a process, and they aren’t looking to us to supersede the city’s own 311 call center. I’d prefer a tool that is more clearly organized around helping citizens help each other in the many small ways that 311 could never handle.&nbsp; (Of course, it’s also technically feasible that we could set up a bridge between a crowd-sourced solution and the city’s 311 system so that calls they get which are not “actionable” could be routed to the crowd tool, and also administrators could forward requests which are for the city to cover directly into the 311 system.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And if the site is more organized around neighborly help, it would be good to work with volunteer organizations like Rotary, Kiwanis, scout troops, churches, and the like to get more offers for help in the system and to have more eyes reviewing the site and helping to match offers for help with requests.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, while we appreciated the story leads we gathered from the tool (see below), we’re much more interested in making sure that everyone who could benefit from it knows about it. Next time we’ll work with any interested local media organizations to set up a site in partnership, so that there are no obstacles to them promoting it widely.
                            </p>

                                CrowdMap was a good solution because it didn’t require writing any code, and only took a few hours to configure. However, the flip-side of easy-to-launch is that less customization is available. We might have liked to have a few extra pages of information or resources, or to put more specific text on the “submit a report” form. Ushahidi (CrowdMap’s big brother) is also available for installation on our own servers, and if we went that route, we could almost certainly have added those kinds of customizations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While Ushahidi and CrowdMap dominate the discussion of crowd-based crisis response applications, we began to wonder if it was actually designed to solve problems other than ours. Ushahidi’s origin was in collecting reports of violence during elections in Kenya. Administrators would then edit the reports with assessments of “source reliability” and “information probability,” with the ultimate goal of marking reports as “verified.” We weren’t particularly concerned with making those calls for the reports we received.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In retrospect, we were thinking of problem reports as bugs which needed fixing. (We are software developers, after all.) We were looking for ways to adapt CrowdMap to work more like a bug tracker, allowing us to indicate that a report had been assigned to someone, or that it had been resolved and could be hidden from the default view. We tried a few hacks using categories and editing report titles, but didn’t quite find a strategy that satisfied. If Ushahidi will continue to be deployed in this kind of situation, it might benefit from building in a few concepts from the world of bug-tracking software.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One specific challenge we encountered was maintaining contact with people reporting issues. In some cases people made pretty specific requests for help, but did not provide any contact information, or if they did, they provided it in fields which are not public by default. Since we weren’t going to be able to help each person making a request, it would have been better if helpers could directly contact people in need. We had at least <a title="Ask for Help, Lend a Hand: Snowed in!" href="http://chicagosnow.crowdmap.com/reports/view/333">one case</a> where a helpful citizen went to a specific address which was posted, but couldn’t reach the resident to establish exactly what help was needed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Of course, there are conventional bug-tracker applications which I guess could be applied to a situation like this, although I don’t know of any which integrate with a map or with SMS-reporting, and most bug-trackers would be intimidating to regular folks. There are also existing “civic bug trackers” like <a href="http://seeclickfix.com/">SeeClickFix</a> which are in some ways closer to what, in retrospect, we wanted, although we’d have to do more development of our own to customize it for a specific event.

                                While it wasn’t our primary goal, it’s worth noting that reports to the Crowd Map did support some of the Tribune’s reporting. Early on Wednesday morning, an editor identified about a dozen sources to contact for more detailed accounts of their blizzard experiences, and those supported several stories including <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-02/news/ct-met-stranded-20110202_1_snow-related-motorists-rescue">this one</a>.

                            <p>
                                It’s hard to tell just what impact we had with the crowd map. While they were a small fraction of our overall reports, we did have about fifty people <a href="http://chicagosnow.crowdmap.com/reports/?c=2">offering help</a> and another 50 reporting <a href="http://chicagosnow.crowdmap.com/reports/?c=5">victories</a> (my favorite: <a href="http://chicagosnow.crowdmap.com/reports/view/183">“Here in Logan Square, I went outside with my boyfriend to build a snowman and came back inside with a fiance. This blizzard’s not so bad after all.”</a>) I’d like to think that even more people would have helped each other out if we could tune the tools and the process a little bit. And there was clearly a lot of enthusiasm for the general idea.
