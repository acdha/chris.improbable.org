                                Even the most lethal pathogens we know of don’t kill every single infected individual.<sup><a href="http://www.iayork.com/MysteryRays/2011/02/27/patients-pathogens-ecosystems-2/#footnote_0_2788" title="Even rabies virus, for example, which kills well over 99.999% of the people it infects, has had a half-dozen people survive. Myxomatosis virus let a few rabbits survive, and their progeny became relatively resistant; there are a handful of long-term survivors of HIV treatment; and when we get down to things like ebola and smallpox, 10-30% of infected people survive.">1</a></sup>. Sometimes this is because the pathogen that infects the person is relatively weak. Sometimes it’s because the dose was low. And sometimes it’s because of something intrinsic to the patient. Some people are genetically resistant to HIV, because they have a mutated receptor, for example.

                                The opposite is also true. Sometimes people are more intrinsically susceptible to a pathogen. That became terribly clear during the AIDS epidemic, when quite innocuous agents started killing people, but there are probably many, many natural genetic variants that make us susceptible to some pathogens, just as some make us resistant. When epidemiologists look for “risk factors” that increase mortality or disease severity, this is part of the information they’re trying to tease out, in a rather crude way Sorting this out is part of the goal of the whole personalized medicine movement.

                                We now learn that this was probably because the researcher had his own genetic mutation, hereditary hematochromatosis, which leads to increased levels of iron in the blood.
