                                    Today in London, our two companies announced plans for a broad strategic partnership that combines the respective strengths of our companies and builds a new global mobile ecosystem. The partnership increases our scale, which will result in significant benefits for consumers, developers, mobile operators and businesses around the world. We both are incredibly excited about the journey we are on together.
                                </p>

                                Their OS tanked and we want as many hardware partners as we can get. Together we may make something as good as an iPhone. If we fail, we’ll still have convinced a major competitor to abandon their OS.
                            </p>

                                    While the specific details of the deal are being worked out, here’s a quick summary of what we are working towards:

                                    <li>Nokia will adopt Windows Phone as its primary smartphone strategy, innovating on top of the platform in areas such as imaging, where Nokia is a market leader.
                                    </li>

                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Windows Phone 7 is the one true strategy, and Nokia shall put no strategy before it. ‘Imaging’ is important to Nokia, so we’ll help them save face there.

                                    <li>Nokia will help drive and define the future of Windows Phone. Nokia will contribute its expertise on hardware design, language support, and help bring Windows Phone to a larger range of price points, market segments and geographies.

                                Business is changing. Changing at the speed of information. Whoever adapts first, wins. In order to compete, we innovate. In order to innovate, we redefine. And how do we redefine? With a new definition. Imagine a new way to do business that’s faster than a cheetah, more powerful than another cheetah, a way of doing business that’s more magnificent than a fish, or a whale. Jabberwocky. The game is changing, right now. Coming in 2012.
