                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                For those of you too lazy to read all ten billion words of Lawrence Wright’s New Yorker article on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_wright">Paul Haggis and Scientology</a>, here’s a list of the things the Church of Scientology denies:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    He staffed the ships with volunteers, many of them teen-agers, who called themselves the Sea Organization. Hubbard and his followers cruised the Mediterranean searching for loot he had stored in previous lifetimes. (The church denies this.)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Scientology defectors are full of tales of forcible family separations, which the church almost uniformly denies.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Hawkins told me that if a Sea Org member sought outside help he would be punished, either by being declared a Suppressive Person or by being sent off to do manual labor, as Hawkins was made to do after Miscavige beat him. The church denies that Hawkins was mistreated …
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    … he presumed that the church had obtained its information from the declarations that members sometimes provide after auditing. Such confessions are supposed to be confidential. Scientology denies that it obtained the information this way, and Davis produced an affidavit, signed by Scobee, in which she admits to having liaisons.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The church denies that it pressures members to terminate pregnancies.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The church denies this characterization and “vigorously objects to the suggestion that Church funds inure to the private benefit of Mr. Miscavige.”
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    He worked for fourteen months on the renovation of the Freewinds, the only ship left in Scientology’s fleet; he also says that he installed bars over the doors of the Hole, at the Gold Base, shortly after Rathbun escaped. (The church denies this.)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Cruise brought in two motorcycles to be painted, a Triumph and a Honda Rune; the Honda had been given to him by Spielberg after the filming of “War of the Worlds.” “The Honda already had a custom paint job by the set designer,” Brousseau recalls. Each motorcycle had to be taken apart completely, and all the parts nickel-plated, before it was painted. (The church denies Brousseau’s account.)
                                </p>
