                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                A recent report on a poll finding that <a href="http://publicpolicypolling.blogspot.com/2011/02/romney-and-birthers.html">a majority of Republicans (that is, likely primary voters) are “birthers”</a>, with only 28 per cent confident that Obama was born in the United States has raised, not for the first time, the question “how can they think that?” and “do they really believe that?”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Such questions are the domain of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnotology">agnotology</a>, the study of culturally-induced ignorance or doubt. Agnotology is not, primarily, the study of ignorance in the ordinary sense of the term. So, for example, someone who shares the beliefs of their community, unaware that those beliefs might be subject to challenge, might be ignorant as a result of their cultural situation, but they are not subject to culturally-induced ignorance in the agnotological sense.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But this kind of ignorance is not at issue in the case of birtherism. Even in communities where birtherism is universal (or at least where any dissent is kept quiet), it must be obvious that not everyone in the US thinks that the elected president was born outside the US and therefore ineligible for office.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Rather, birtherism is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth">shibboleth</a>, that is, an affirmation that marks the speaker as a member of their community or tribe. (The original shibboleth was a password chosen by the Gileadites because their Ephraimite enemies could not say “Sh”.) Asserting a belief that would be too absurd to countenance for anyone outside a given tribal/ideological group makes for a good political shibboleth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s clear, as <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/weigel/archive/2011/02/15/poll-most-republicans-doubt-obama-s-citizenship-as-birtherism-becomes-a-screen-for-ideology.aspx">Dave Weigel points out, that beliefs of this kind are a marker for partisanship</a>, as witness the high correlation between stated birtherist beliefs and approval of Palin. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the statement isn’t actually believed. Rather this is an open question and an important one for agnotological understanding of the emergence of comprehensive culturally induced ignorance as a marker for the Republican tribe.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this context, it’s worth noting that birtherism is only a minor part of Obama-related Republican agnotology. The <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/joshgerstein/0810/Poll_46_of_GOP_thinks_Obamas_Muslim.html">belief that Obama is a secret Muslim is similarly widely held</a>, as is the view that he <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/30/obama-islamic-fundamentalist-gop-polled-majority-says_n_699883.html">sympathises with those seeking to impose sharia law</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s also worth distinguishing such stated beliefs from statements like “Obama is a socialist”, in which what matters most is the interpretation of the term “socialist” (AFAIC, the most common US meaning is “Democrat with spine”). Compare “Bush is a war criminal”. In these cases, facts about what Obama (or Bush) has actually done are less relevant than judgements about the appropriateness of labels.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My feeling (derived largely from observations on climate change and creationism, which raise similar questions) is that we can distinguish numerous different belief states that go along with birtherist answers to opinion poll questions. There are lots of nuances, but most are combinations of the following
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A conspiracy-theoretic view of the world in which liberal elites (a term encompassing Democrats, unions, schoolteachers, scientists, academics and many others) are plotting to undermine the American way of life and replace it with some unspecified, but awful alternative. In this case, answers to these questions reflect actual beliefs
                                </li>
                                <li>Partisanship as suggested by Weigel in which Republicans choose to give the most negative answer possible about Obama as an affirmation of tribal identity.
                                </li>
                                <li>Doublethink in which people are aware that in some mundane sense Obama was born in Hawaii, but also believe that Republican ideology is true and implies the birtherist answer
                                </li>
                                <li>Conformism, in which people know the truth but give the culturally preferred answer, or choose some evasive form of words, as with <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/212114/john-boehners-birther-cynicism">John Boehner</a> recently.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Does all this hurt or help the Republicans? In short-run electoral terms, I think it helps. A base of loyal supporters who, for one or other of the reasons mentioned above, are immune to factual evidence has to help win elections. There are, however, two big costs
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>First, people have noticed that Republicans have a problem with reality. That perception, which undermines the rationale for all sorts of thinking about policy, will take a while to sink in, but it will also be hard to erase once it is generally accepted. In the long run, this has to turn off a fair number of Republican-leaning independents and any remaining Republicans with a capacity for embarrassment.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Double-think is very difficult, and people will start to act on the basis of their beliefs. If those beliefs are ludicrously false, trouble is likely to follow.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
