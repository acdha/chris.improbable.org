We've all been assuming that tea party supporters are different. After all, its self-appointed leaders continuously say that they want spending cut, period.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But it may not be true, at least for self-identified tea party types in South Dakota. <a href="http://dakotapoll.com/dakotapoll-finds-large-majority-of-tea-party-supporters-favor-sales-tax-increase-for-education">As this poll from the DakotaPoll</a> shows, tea partiers don't much support specific spending cuts either. And forget about waste, fraud, and abuse. When asked if they would support spending cuts to a local military base if it was deemed to be unnecessary, 71 percent said no.
