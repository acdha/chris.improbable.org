                                    Ms. Jonsdottir has led a movement in her country to advance free speech, freedom of the press and transparency in government. This initiative, the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative, aims to bring together transparency laws from multiple jurisdictions to create the strongest media freedom laws in the world. This week it was revealed that the U.S. Justice Department, which is trying to build a criminal case against Wikileaks, is trying to access Ms. Jonsdottir’s Twitter account, as well as the account of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, saying they have relevant material to an ongoing criminal investigation.

                                        Q: There is no indication they [the U.S.] are targeting you?

                                    <p>
                                        A: You don’t know because of timing. They might think I have some information or might want to interrogate me or get my computer. Or they might just turn me away at the border. I left Wikileaks in early October 2010, late September....
                                    </p>

                                        The Icelandic Modern Media Initiative (IMMI) is an open source legislation so any country can take it and adapt it and cherry pick from the best laws around the world. We know how difficult it is for investigative journalists because of all the gag orders and privacy restraints. I see Wikileaks as people who do direct action and move the barriers for the norm, and thus it will be easier for others to go a bit further. If we claim we live in a democracy but don’t have free press or freedom of information online, then we are obviously not in a very democratic society.

                                        Q: With Wikileaks, the response has been to the contrary, with governments looking at ways to better secure and protect information so there will be no paper trail. Can you address that?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A: I think what governments need to learn instead of trying to create more secrecy is that the process around secrecy is unchecked. A lot of material is labeled secret because it can be. There is no transparency in the process and no explanation. Maybe governments can learn something instead of becoming defensive when their weaknesses are exposed....
                                    </p>

                                        Q: Why did you leave Wikileaks?

                                    <p>
                                        A: The “Collateral Murder” video..[a classified U.S. military video depicting the slaying of a dozen people in Baghdad, including two Reuters news staff]. We produced it with Icelandic State TV. We felt we needed to do fact checking. We sent a journalist to Baghdad and spotted children in the van to see if he could find the witnesses, a soldier carrying them. The journalist found the children and their mother. The man driving the van was their father and he was driving them to school. Showed video to families of Reuters staff. Hardest thing about process was putting faces to names of bodies being torn apart. That was one of my jobs.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Wikileaks was criticized for the name “Collateral Murder”. I didn’t like it either. But we didn’t have an agenda against the U.S. authorities. Despite the criticism on the name of the video, we did actually go through it very, very carefully. I did some of the background work and we found out about the names of the journalists and their families. The more we discovered the more humane the story became. I was in Iceland and heard from a solider on YouTube messaging system. He said ‘I was the soldier who found the children in the van and who is carrying them. I could never stop thinking about them’. He has come forward and publicly apologized to Iraqi people and become active in Veterans for Peace in the U.S. But none of the U.S. media was interested in picking up his story. We printed out his letter of apology and gave it to the press and none of them picked it up. So I often question the ability of the media to dig a bit further and to do their job with this sort of material. It is troubling that the media doesn’t care. That’s why Wikileaks has gone further and further to try to get attention to the leaks.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The reason I left Wikileaks was what happened around the “Collateral Murder”, I realized this was going to grow into a massive organization or would bring attention to the organization. I felt it didn’t have the structures in place in how to utilize volunteers and security. I was concerned about lack of transparency in relation to the money issues. I wanted a meeting. I became obsessed that we had to have a meeting to create the structures and if you don’t have proper structures and a means for people to communicate in a functional way, it’s a disaster. I couldn’t get the meeting. All the volunteers wanted the meeting except one. He didn’t feel it was necessary...
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Q: Who gets to decide what is secret?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A: The public should be able to ask why. Should be a process where they can get an answer to why. There is nothing wrong with transparency. We haven’t suffered because of lack of transparency or too much freedom of information. We have suffered more because of secrets.
                                    </p>

                                    ...I think that opens up a whole can of worms when it comes to parliamentary immunity worldwide. And that’s why Icelandic authorities are taking this very seriously. And the foreign affairs minister and the justice minister have both said that they are concerned about this and are looking into this. And the president of the Icelandic parliament, equivalent to the speaker of the House, is looking into the legalities around this issue.
                                    <p>
                                        And let’s just turn the tables around, and like, currently there’s an investigation into how Iceland became a part of the Coalition of the Willing for the Iraqi war, and there’s an investigation in our parliament. Let’s say that I would like to get the information from all members of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the U.S. Senate in relation to their knowledge about war crimes in Iraq. Would the U.S. authorities feel comfortable with that? Let’s say every member of parliament that has ever fought for Tibet or Taiwan or other countries that China is not happy about, would the rest of the, like, let’s say, the United States parliamentarians be happy if China would order, have similar orders on their privacy?

                                    "The demand for access to platforms of expression cannot be satisfied when using them lands you in prison," Clinton said in the speech, referring to crackdowns on bloggers and Twitter users in countries like Syria or Iran.

                                        Cindy Cohn of the Electronic Frontier Foundation noted that as Clinton spoke, "the US Department of Justice was trying to keep secret many of the facts of its investigation into the very mechanism that inspired the revolutions in Egypt and Tunisia."

                                        In Jonsdottir's case, actions by the court and US government are "especially troubling" because they show a disregard for Icelandic law, which gives lawmakers in the Nordic country broad immunity, according to Cohn.

It's also possible that the US government is interested in Jonsdottir <a href="http://joyb.blogspot.com/2010/12/when-is-right-time-to-offer-political.html">because she wrote in her blog on Dec. 12 about the possibility of offering Julian Assange political asylum in Iceland; she did not think he would be safe either in England or the US.</a>

                                    Last month Jonsdottir received notice from Twitter that the U.S. Justice Department was seeking records from her Twitter account from Nov. 1, 2009 on. According to the court order, unsealed by the court at Twitter’s request, the government also wants the same information on accounts for Appelbaum and Gonggrijp. The order seeks full contact details for the accounts (phone numbers and addresses), IP addresses used to access the accounts, connection records (“records of session times and durations”) and data transfer information, such as the size of data file sent to someone else and the destination IP. The latter suggest the request is likely a boilerplate request, of a form that might be submitted to ISPs, e-mail providers and social networking sites like Facebook.

                                        The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union filed the motion to challenge on Jan. 26, as well as a motion to unseal the filing, which was granted Tuesday. The groups have also sought to unseal the Justice Department’s application for the order it served on Twitter, which provides the government’s justification for demanding the information. The demand for the records is part of a grand jury investigation that’s believed to be probing WikiLeaks for its high-profile leaks of classified U.S. material.

                                        The government is seeking the records under 18 USC 2703(d), a provision of the 1994 Stored Communications Act that governs law enforcement access to non-content internet records, such as transaction information. More powerful than a subpoena, but less than a search warrant, a 2703(d) order is supposed to be issued when prosecutors provide a judge with “specific and articulable facts” that show the information sought is relevant and material to a criminal investigation. But the people targeted in the records demand don’t have to be suspected of criminal wrongdoing themselves.

                                    U.S. Magistrate Judge Theresa Buchanan in Alexandria, during an hour-long hearing today, considered a challenge to her order requiring Twitter to give investigators data on subscribers “associated with WikiLeaks,” including its leader, Julian Assange, and Bradley Manning, a U.S. soldier charged with leaking classified information.
                                    <p>
                                        “The government says there’s no expectation of privacy when logging into Twitter,” John Keker, a San Francisco-based lawyer representing one of the WikiLeaks backers, told Buchanan during the hearing. “Our point is, this is not phone records. It’s not bank records. This is something different.”
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Keker said the information would allow the government to create a map of people tied to WikiLeaks, which could chill free speech online.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        “It is incredibly powerful to know who the opposition is and who they’re working with,” Keker said, citing as an example Egypt and Tunisia, where citizens used social networks to push for regime changes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Buchanan questioned Keker’s argument that turning over the information would violate Fourth Amendment protections against warrantless searches and seizures by the government. She said she thought Keker exaggerated the amount of information her order would allow the government to get.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The hearing was the first public skirmish in the government’s criminal investigation of Assange and others who may have helped leak diplomatic cables and classified military documents through the WikiLeaks website.

                                        “This is just round one in what promises to be an ongoing fight about the government trying to have the tools to bring WikiLeaks into an American court,” Bruce D. Brown, a media lawyer at Baker Hostetler in Washington, said in a phone interview.

                                    <p>
                                        Buchanan on Dec. 14 ordered Twitter to give the government records and information related to the accounts of several named individuals and anyone else linked to Assange. Prosecutors asked for subscriber names, contact information, billing records, user activity, Internet Protocol addresses and source and destination e-mail addresses.
                                    </p>

                                        The judge initially barred the San Francisco-based social networking company from disclosing the government’s demand, which came as part of a federal grand jury investigation in Virginia. She unsealed the order on Jan. 5, saying it was in the “best interest of the investigation” and allowed Twitter to disclose the order to its users....

                                    <p>
                                        Twitter negotiated with the government to restrict the time frame of the order to activity from Nov. 15, 2009, to June 1, 2010, and limit the scope of the information being sought, according to court papers.

                                        The three are asking Buchanan to force investigators to seek a warrant for the information. A search warrant would mean the government has shown probable cause, a higher hurdle than the “relevant” and “material” standard under the Stored Communications Act, on which Buchanan based her order. ...

                                        Assistant U.S. Attorney Andy Peterson told Buchanan the government is still in the preliminary stages of its WikiLeaks investigation and that publicly releasing information would damage its probe. ...
