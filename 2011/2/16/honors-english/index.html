                                </p>

                                    And suddenly this conversation has taken an unwelcome turn. I like the idea of my daughter taking honors English. I do not like the idea of my daughter taking honors English from someone who regards <em>The Fountainhead</em> as worthwhile. I do not like the idea of her studying literature with a teacher who <em>doesn't like literature</em> and who seems intent on infecting students with her distaste for it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Set aside the appalling themes and juvenile narcissism of the book's pseudo-philosophy. It's dull. Numbingly, claw-your-eyes-out dull. It's horribly written, yet it's horribleness never manages to be horrible in an entertaining way. This is the sort of book that can ruin reading -- the very <em>idea</em> of reading -- for months or years afterward.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And beyond that, an honors English course is supposed to prepare students for college. Slogging through <em>The Fountainhead</em> does nothing to prepare a student for college. No one needs to read this book in preparation for college. No one needs to read this book <em>in</em> college.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Well ... I suppose it's possible that psych majors specializing in delusional, self-reinforcing agnotology might read sections of this book as case studies. But I don't see any reason that even they would need to force themselves to get through the entire thing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And I don't see any reason that someone teaching an honors English class for college-bound high school students would waste those students' time with 900+ pages of this book instead of reading books they'll actually need to know later in their studies -- books they might enjoy and benefit from.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Lest any of Ayn Rand's strange little disciples attempt to twist my comments here into a call for "censorship," please note that I am not calling for this book to be banned or forbidden. I'm simply pointing out that it deserves to be ignored.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We can't read everything. Most of us won't get around to reading <em>most</em> things and we'll wind up leaving inspiring, insightful, beautiful, life-enhancing books on the shelf. Time spent reading repetitive dreck like <em>The Fountainhead</em> is time spent <em>not</em> reading those other books -- books that actually deserve to be read, the reading of which will enrich us and maybe even improve us.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Reading <em>The Fountainhead</em> does not enrich or improve. It stupefies. Time spent reading this book would be better spent watching television. Time spent reading this book would be better spent watching a <em>Jersey Shore</em> marathon on television. That execrable MTV program would do just as much to prepare a high school student for college. And Snooki is a better role model -- a better <em>person</em> -- than Rand or her protagonists.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If the honors English teacher actually did require students to watch a <em>Jersey Shore</em> marathon, I would suspect that this wasn't a very good class. But I would be less suspicious of that teacher than I am of this one.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This whole thing has me flummoxed. Learning that this book is the centerpiece of the honors English class is like finding out that Ken Ham will be teaching honors biology.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is depressing to learn that your child's education may be best served by <em>avoiding</em> honors English.
                                </p>
