                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Belgium sets a dubious record on Thursday when it overtakes post-war Iraq as the country that has gone longest without a government.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s a surreal achievement greeted with a mix of amusement and quiet despair in the streets of Brussels. (I speak of “Brussels” as the capital of Belgium here – Eurocrats based in the city pay only passing attention to things Belgian).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For those not following the <a title="FT.com/Europe - Belgium deadlocked as talks mediator quits" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/09abd910-19e3-11e0-a8d8-00144feab49a.html#axzz1E41ZfwLZ">Kafkaesque saga that is Belgian politics</a>, ever since the <a title="FT.com/Europe - Belgium's king accepts PM's resignation" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dd23b5c6-515a-11df-bed9-00144feab49a.html#axzz1E41ZfwLZ">government collapsed on April 26th</a>, and after Flemish nationalists became the country’s biggest party in the <a title="FT.com/Europe - Belgian elections show rise in separatism" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0bf8f528-76f4-11df-ba79-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1E41ZfwLZ">ensuing June elections</a>, politicians have been unable to patch over linguistic and cultural differences that separate Dutch speakers in Flanders from Francophones in Wallonia.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The <a title="FT.com/Iraq - Iraqi factions unite in government" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1d7f9a50-0d25-11e0-82ff-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1E41ZfwLZ">recently-settled Iraq dispute</a> lasted 249 days after the Shiite party of sitting prime minister Nouri Maliki was finally returned to power in December, despite having fewer seats than a secular slate headed by former prime minister Iyad Allawi, which had the support of may of Iraq’s minority Sunnis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If sectarian differences can be overcome in Iraq, perhaps they will someday be in Belgium, too. But no one is predicting it will happen any time soon.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The biggest party in Flanders, Bart De Wever’s<a title="N-VA.be" href="http://www.n-va.be/">New Flemish Alliance</a>, or N-VA, ran on a platform of securing more powers for its (already powerful) regional authority at the expense of the federal government.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Walloons worry that fewer powers at federal level means less redistribution of tax money towards their southern region. Flanders – home to booming cities like Antwerp and Ghent – has become markedly richer in recent decades, an inversion of the time when Wallonia’s heavy industries made it the wealthier of the two.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                De Wever and his allies – which now include most Flemish parties – insist on agreeing overarching state reform before a government can be formed, which has led to the 249-day delay.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What has happened in the last eight months, a time in which most countries can form a government and watch it fall out of public favour? A procession of political grandees have been appointed to advise <a title="The Belgian Monarchy - Royal Family - King Albert II" href="http://www.monarchie.be/royal-family/king-albert-ii">King Albert II</a> on how to exit this particular impasse, so far with little success.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Right now it’s the turn of newly-appointed <a title="Site personnel de Didier Reynders" href="http://www.didier-reynders.be/">Didier Reynders</a>, a Wallonian liberal and the outgoing finance minister – like all cabinet ministers, he has been “outgoing” since the government collapsed in April – to try and broker some kind of agreement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Reynders has his work cut out for him. The seven parties named early on as possible coalition partners have not met as a group since September. Much of the time has been spent in negotiations over how to negotiate. So even if there is a breakthrough, it could still be months before a government is formed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Alternatively, the whole thing could be wrapped up in a few days.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But in political circles, there’s a growing belief that no compromise can be reached and another round of elections is likely. More precisely, they believe elections will be raised as a way to see the “final best offer” each political group has been holding back.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The N-VA, which was founded only ten years ago, has seen its poll numbers rise as it continues to hold out, however, so it has little incentive to seal a deal. The Francophone parties don’t want to give in too much from their normal orthodox line in case they have to stand for elections in the near future.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For the average Belgian, the absence of a government has barely been noticeable, however. Belgium ran <a title="Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union" href="http://www.eutrio.be/">the EU presidency</a> in the second half of 2010 with aplomb. Its caretaker government has been able to tackle big crises (<a title="FT.com/Europe - Belgian PM backed over cuts" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dfd61114-1e7e-11e0-87d2-00144feab49a.html">like when bond markets started wondering about its high debt levels</a>) competently. Regional authorities make sure the trains run on time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Some speculate that may in fact be Mr De Wever’s ploy: show that Belgium doesn’t need a federal government. Then the break-up of Belgium that his party is pushing for won’t seem like such a big deal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If only Iraq were so easy.
                            </p>
