1.  Introduction

   HTTP [RFC2616] is one of the most common application level protocols
   transported over TLS [RFC5246].  (This combination is commonly known
   as HTTPS based on the URL scheme used to indicate it.)  HTTPS clients
   have to function with a huge range of TLS implementations, some of
   higher quality than others.  This text aims to document some of the
   behaviours of existing HTTPS clients that are designed to ensure
   maximum interoperability.

   This text should not be taken as a recommendation that future HTTPS
   clients adopt these behaviours.  The security implications of each
   need to be carefully considered by each implementation.  However,
   these behaviours are common and the authors consider it better to
   document the state of practice than to simply wish it were otherwise.


2.  Handshake message fragmentation

   Many servers will fail to process a handshake message that spans more
   than one record.  These servers will close the connection when they
   encounter such a handshake message.  HTTPS clients will commonly
   ensure against that by either packing all handshake messages in a
   flow into a single record, or by creating a single record for each
   handshake message.


3.  Protocol Fallback

   Despite it being nearly twelve years since the publication of TLS 1.0
   [RFC2246], around 3% of HTTPS servers will reject a valid TLS
   "ClientHello".  These rejections can take the form of immediately
   closing the connection or a fatal alert.  Intolerance to the
   following has been observed:

      Advertising version TLS 1.0.

      Advertising a TLS version greater than TLS 1.0 (around 2% for 1.1
      or 1.2, around 3% for greater than 1.2).

      Advertising a version greater than 0x03ff (around 65% of servers)

      The presence of any extensions (around 7% of servers)

      The presence of specific extensions ("server_name" and
      "status_request" intolerance has been observed, although in very
      low numbers).

      The presence of any advertised compression algorithms

   Next, some servers will misbehave after processing the "ClientHello"
   message.  Negotiating the use of "DEFLATE" compression can result in
   fatal "bad_record_mac", "decompression_failure" or
   "decryption_failed" alerts.  Notably, OpenSSL prior to version 0.9.8c
   will intermittently fail to process compressed finished messages due
   to a work around of a previous padding bug.

   Lastly, some servers will negotiate the use of SSLv3 but select a
   TLS-only cipher suite.

   In all these cases, HTTPS clients will often enter a fallback mode.
   The connection is retried using only SSLv3 and without advertising
   any compression algorithms.  (This is obviously an easy downgrade
   attack.)  Also, the fallback can be triggered by transient network
   problems, which often manifest as an abruptly closed connection.
   Since SSLv3 does not provide any means of Server Name Indication
   [RFC3546], the fallback connection can use the wrong certificate
   chain, resulting in a very surprising certificate error.


4.  More implementation mistakes

   Non-fatal errors in version negotiation also occur.  Some 0.2% of
   servers use the version from the record header.  Around 0.6% of
   servers require that the version in the "ClientHello" and record
   header match in order to respect the version in the "ClientHello".  A
   very low number of servers echo whatever version the client
   advertises.

   In the event that the client supports a higher protocol version than
   the server, about 0.4% of servers require that the RSA
   "ClientKeyExchange" message include the server's protocol version.

   Some 30% of servers don't check the version in an RSA
   "ClientKeyExchange" at all.


5.  Certificate Chains

   Certificate chains presented by servers will commonly be missing
   intermediate certificates, have certificates in the wrong order and
   will include unrelated, superfluous certificates.  Servers have been
   observed presenting more than ten certificates in what we assume is a
   drive-by shooting approach to including the correct intermediate
   certificate.

   In order to validate chains which are missing certificates, some
   HTTPS clients will collect intermediate certificates from other
   servers.  Clients will commonly put all the presented certificates
   into a set and try to validate a chain assuming only that the first
   certificate is the leaf.


6.  Insufficient Security

   Some 65% of servers support SSLv2 (beyond just supporting the
   handshake in order to upgrade to SSLv3 or TLS).  HTTPS clients will
   typically not support SSLv2, nor send SSLv2 handshakes by default.
   Of those servers, 80% support the export ciphersuites.  (Although
   about 3% of those servers negotiate weak ciphersuites only to show a
   warning.)

   Some servers will choose very small multiplicative group sizes for
   their ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exchange (for example, 256-bits).
   Some HTTPS clients will reject all multiplicative group sizes smaller
   than 512-bits while others will retry after demoting DHE ciphersuites
   in their "ClientHello".
