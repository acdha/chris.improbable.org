                                Aaron Barr, CEO of security company HBGary Federal, spent the month of January trying to uncover the real identities of the hacker collective Anonymous—only to end with his company website knocked offline, his e-mails stolen, 1TB of backups deleted, and his personal iPad wiped when Anonymous found out.&nbsp;

In a sea of technical jargon, social media analysis, and digital detective work, it stands out as a truly human moment, when Barr revealed himself to Anonymous and dialogued directly with senior leaders and "members" of the group.

                                The encounter began on February 5. Barr had managed to get his work written up in a <em>Financial Times</em> story the day before, and now strange traffic was pouring in to HBGary Federal. With his research done and his story in print, Barr needed only to work up some conference slides and prepare for a meeting with the FBI, which had been tracking Anonymous for some time. So Barr ditched the covert identities he had been using to watch the group, and on February 5 he approached a person on Facebook whom he believed was the powerful CommanderX.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Barr's apparent motives were multiple: to mitigate any revenge upon his company, but also to meet as equals with his hacker subjects. No harm, no foul, right? Anonymous didn't agree. (Quotes in this article are provided verbatim, typos and all.)

So please tell the folks there that I am not out to get you guys I knew you guys were a risky target but nothing risked nothing gained. People can show their bravado thats fine I can deal with that. Just want the 'leadership' to know what my intent isthat will filter as it needs to I am sure.

                                    <strong>Barr</strong>:  I will talk about aliases. I won't talk about names. But please don't play me a chump any more than you have to to protect anons cred. I know more than IRC aliases. u have a lot of firepower and know how in some dark cornershell some of them may even know Greg Hoglund the CEO of our other company. So if it is some of your guys just want to make sure they don't get too aggressive.

                                The material "uploading right now" was apparently Barr's private e-mails; Anonymous had infiltrated his company e-mail server, where Barr was the admin, and had taken more than 40,000 messages from three top execs. They were then uploaded to The Pirate Bay.

                                The next day, February 6, the attacks turned serious, and Barr realized the extent of what Anonymous had done to him and to his company, which was currently in negotiations to sell itself to a pair of interested buyers. This was no longer a game; it looked more like war. The sheer freewheeling raucousness of what follows illustrates as well as anything the nature of Anonymous, and it's worth quoting at length. (A few unimportant bits have been stripped for clarity, denoted by an ellipsis.)

                                On February 7, Barr's compromised Twitter account contained the following posts, which appear to be from Barr himself—though it's hard to say. (Those from his Anonymous persecutors have a very different tone, and contain more links and profanity.)

                                    Ok. Well this has been fun. Anon has certainly done a number on me for the last, wow has it only been 24hrs? Seems longer...

                                    site defaced, twitter hacked, email taken...priceless.

                                    Does this mean I have become an internet celebrity...not quite how I imagined it?

                                    ok. So Anon has done a number on me. Probably going to take a bit to piece things together, probably more to come.

                                But there has been no more to come. Twitter has now locked the account, according to Anonymous.

                                The persecution was brutal. People began defacing images of Barr, hosting them all in a central repository for easy viewing—they even dredged up a personal picture of the man dressed as The Hulk for a round of trick-or-treating with his kid. HBGary, a part owner of HBGary Federal, sent its own President Penny Leavy into the Anonymous chat rooms to ask them to stop—or at least to keep the e-mails private. Anonymous did not, demanding instead Barr's resignation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Members of the group have spent today apparently prepping to release a new e-mail archive from Leavy's husband, the respected security pro Greg Hoglund, whose own site rootkit.com was compromised by (allegedly) a 16-year-old through a bit of social engineering. The persecution continues.
