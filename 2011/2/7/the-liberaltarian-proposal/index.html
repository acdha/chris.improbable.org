                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Fake fusionism</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Quite a while back, <em>National Review</em> editor Frank Meyers coined the term “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusionism_%28politics%29">fusionism</a>” to describe a political movement built around libertarians and social conservatives working as one ideological unit. Because libertarians and social conservatives both hated Soviet Communism more than each other, they could work together and ignore their differences.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The collapse of the U.S.S.R. showed that fusionism was a manqué, just as Murray Rothbard <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard48.html">said</a> it was. Fusionism was, quite literally, an empty set. If one accepted the conservative view of virtue but maintained that the state had no business enforcing that morality on people who disagreed with it, then one was a libertarian. If one both accepted conservative morality <em>and</em> believed the state had a role to play in inculcating virtue, then one was not a libertarian.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There was no middle ground. There was never any middle ground. The so-called fusionists had mistaken a <em>modus vivendi</em> against the Soviets with a covenant that could and would be sustained indefinitely
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, a <em>modus vivendi</em> still has some political value. If libertarians had more in common with social conservatives, then maybe they could support conservative candidates on a regular basis.&nbsp; Up until the presidency of George W. Bush and the Republican takeover of Congress, I think many libertarians still believed this. While they did not share an ideology with social conservatives, they did — so they thought — share certain policy aspirations with them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I believed that. At least for a time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Paying for death</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What George W. Bush and his fellow Republicans revealed was that conservatives, for the most part, were not interested in making the state smaller. They were interested in using it to benefit <em>themselves</em>. From steel tariffs to the massive prescription drug benefit, the Republicans proved they could spend money with enthusiasm Bill Clinton at least had the sense to reserve for the bedroom.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When socialism collapsed in the Soviet Union, the Republicans maintained and expanded it in the U.S. — for senior citizens, anyway.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Decades after the Soviet adventure in Afghanistan had proven an abject failure, Bush launched one of his own, and then threw in a second expedition to Iraq. It is difficult to imagine an activity less sensitive to Hayekian insights about spontaneous order and unintended consequences than nation-building in a foreign land.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And this is not to mention the <em>hubris</em> of the Predator drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen, nor the awful splatters of slaughtered children that have been their result.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Cash-for-clunkers and other programs that subsidize environmentally beneficial purchases seem, in contrast, quite humble, and almost benign in their charming naivety. Money for AIDS in Africa, or for earthquake victims in Haiti, or for impoverished children living in the wasteland of Detroit — well, a libertarian can’t exactly <em>defend</em> that kind of spending, but at least it does more than produce piles of innocent corpses. At least it does more than prop up defense contractors and other corporate rent-seekers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let us not identify money-for-slaughter with Republicans and money-for-helping-people with Democrats. Obama, more like a Republican than many of his supporters are willing to admit, has spent plenty of both.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The difference is that liberals aren’t exactly comfortable with money-for-slaughter, while conservatives are. The difference is that liberals, in my experience, do want to help people — they’re just not very good at it. They’re not familiar with the insights of public choice economics. They’re too optimistic. They ignore opportunity costs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Libertarians can reject <em>both</em> kinds of spending, in principle. But not with equal vehemence. There is a moral difference between taxing to kill and taxing to help (albeit with the kind of gross incompetence that would get most of us fired from our jobs.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I propose, therefore, the following moral schematic.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If government taking money from those who have much of it to help others who are truly in need is bad, then government spending money to kill innocents is even worse. If there are liberals who are uncomfortable with the killing, even when it is their man filling the skies with missile-packed drones, who would like to see people, all people, living better lives — <em>then these liberals are closer to the libertarian position than conservatives are</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Conservatives are good at killing people. Liberals are bad at helping people. Both of them reject the fundamental libertarian constraint. But while liberals elide that constraint, conservatives profane it with their hypocrisy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>The social conservative</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I haven’t even addressed the social conservative specifically, who supports both the killing of foreigners and the persecution of non-violent drug users. Who supports extraordinary rendition for foreigners, assassination of U.S. citizens, socialism for senior citizens, prison for gays, and concentration camps for illegal immigrants.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I don’t need to address <em>these</em> conservatives, except to say that their disappearance would bring us instantly closer to a civil libertarian society. To their credit, they are more like fascists than hypocrites. And they are not allies to any atheist, any gay, any Muslim, any foreigner, or any other minority, libertarian or not.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Their numbers dwindle. There is nothing else to say about them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>The liberaltarian proposal</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you can accept my moral schematic, then you can support the <em>modus vivendi</em> of liberaltarianism. <a href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/">Will Wilkinson</a> and Brink Lindsey made the term popular, but there’s a good definition of it <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=6593">here</a>. “Liberaltarianism is basically libertarians attempting to knock some sense into liberals on economic issues.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Which is not to say that liberals will become libertarians in all respects. My point all along is that they are <em>already</em> more like libertarians than most conservatives. The aim is simply to correct some of their more egregious errors of <em>fact</em>. In contrast, correcting the more serious <em>moral</em> errors most conservatives make is virtually impossible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                All sensible liberals accept that wage and price controls are a bad idea. When will conservatives come around to adopting the radical proposal that there is something wrong with killing children? How to convince them, if the broken and burned bodies don’t?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Timothy Lee catalogues the liberal shift toward libertarian economic views <a href="http://timothyblee.com/2011/01/19/the-return-of-bottom-up-liberalism/">here</a>. On free trade, marginal tax rates, occupational licensing, and in several other areas, we’re winning. We’ll continue to win — but with liberals, not with conservatives.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And, to some degree, I think the learning can go both ways. In a <a href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/2011/01/20/liberaltarianism-lives/">recent and fascinating</a> post, Wilkinson explores several significant points of tension that remain between liberals and libertarians.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    Most liberals remain pretty hostile to these common libertarian ideas:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Democracy sucks.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Unions hurt more than they help.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Campaign spending is political speech.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Economic inequality does not undermine democracy or democracy’s role in establishing and protecting equal liberty.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Economic rights are as important as political and civil rights, and should be just as vigilantly protected, even if &nbsp;that leads to huge inequalities, which do not, by the way, threaten democracy or the value of political and civil rights.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Taxation is coercive but imprisoning the guy who nicked your lawn gnome isn’t.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                This seems correct to me. Quite a few (all?) of these ideas have less to do with economics and more to do with philosophy. Economics can’t determine whether taxation is more or less coercive than enforcing private property rights. Odds are that it sometimes is and sometimes isn’t.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Wilkinson is also correct that these ideas — these libertarian ideas — prevent a full-fledged liberal-libertarian alliance. I want to close by making plain what he only hints at: that if an alliance is on the offing, libertarians may have to adjust their philosophical view, the way liberals have had to adjust their economic one.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Believing that it is sometimes permissible to take a penny from a millionaire to help a starving child is not libertarian. But it is <em>more</em> libertarian than the conservative belief that it is <em>always</em> permissible to take a lot of money from everyone to kill children in other countries.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We can adjust to, or at least tolerate, such lapses from the moral law, gritting our teeth if necessary, while keeping our hands relatively free of blood, and indulging, temporarily, the well-meaning and somewhat confused liberal who for all his faults at least rejects all the killing.
                            </p>

                                If not, at least let us stay away from those who revel in death, even if they support lower tax rates.
