                                Hypothesis: old specimens in museum collections are invaluable sources of material for molecular forensics research, providing glimpses into the history and ecology of diseases in wildlife
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <span style="float:left;padding:5px"><a href="http://www.researchblogging.org"><img src="http://www.researchblogging.org/public/citation_icons/rb2_large_gray.png" style="border:0"></a></span>Do these exotic names sound familiar: the kioea, Kaua'i 'akialoa, Oahu 'akepa, greater amakihi or the Hawai'i o'o? They are part of the long and still growing roll call of extinct birds from the Hawai'ian archipelago. Not only are their musical-sounding names exotic, but the birds themselves were unique: they were found nowhere else in the world. But now they are all gone forever; their voices silent, wings stilled, the dramas of their loves and the details of their lives forever extinguished, to remain eternal secrets -- almost as if they had never existed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In all, roughly 70 endemic Hawai'ian bird species slipped quietly into extinction during the previous 150 years. But these monumental losses did not go unnoticed by everyone.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sharing the same ocean but located thousands of kilometers away, Ecuadorian officials became increasingly concerned that the unique flora and fauna inhabiting the Galápagos Island archipelago would meet the same fate as Hawai'i's famous extinct birds. Because introduced diseases, particularly avian malaria and poxviruses, played a contributory or pivotal role in the extinction of many Hawai'ian birds, the officials wanted to know whether these diseases are present on the Galápagos and to learn when and how they got there so scientists could design disease management policies to protect the unique wildlife on their little islands.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unlike Hawai'i, where the endemic flora and fauna is almost completely extirpated, the Galápagos archipelago still retains almost all of its native wildlife. But some Galápagos bird populations are in serious trouble due to rat predation and other problems. Further, many of Galápagos birds, including Darwin's finches, have pox-like symptoms -- warts. Already, it is apparent that these lesions are causing problems for Galapagos birds. Scientists found that during the 1982-1983 El Niño event, Galápagos mockingbirds, <em>Mimus parvulus</em>, with pox-like lesions suffered significantly higher mortality than those without. But are the Galápagos birds' warts caused by one or more types of avian poxviruses?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Recently, a research team found that at least some Galápagos birds are infected by a group of <em>Avipoxvirus</em> variants known as canarypox. But these are the survivors: if birds recover from the initial poxvirus infection, the resulting warty lesions can become so debilitating that the victims cannot walk, cannot see to eat or they cannot swallow, and they can even lose their toes, feet and beaks. But no one knows how long these canarypox strains have been present in Galápagos, when they arrived nor the sorts of impacts they are having on the bird populations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is where ecologist Patricia Parker comes in. A professor of biology at the University of Missouri-Saint Louis (UMSL) and senior scientist at the Saint Louis Zoo, Dr Parker studies the behaviour of Galápagos birds and the ecology of their diseases.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since increasing numbers of birds with pox-like symptoms are being reported throughout the Galápagos archipelago, Dr Parker wanted to know if these lesions are caused by canarypox. Did people or their pets bring canarypox to the Galápagos? When did the virus arrive and how can we prevent further damage to Galápagos birds?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To address these questions, Dr Parker assembled an international team of researchers from throughout the United States and Ecuador. Their goal: to collect tissue samples from pox-like lesions on Galápagos birds from as far back in time as they could possibly go. To do this, the team tracked down all the birds that had been collected throughout the Galápagos islands (figure 1) more than one hundred years ago. Nearly all of these collected birds are now in the hands of natural history museums throughout the world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After appropriate museum collections were located, one or more team members visited these specimens and carefully examined them for pox-like lesions. Using modern forensic techniques, the researchers collected tiny tissue samples for forensic testing. Most of the samples were collected from specimens held by the California Academy of Sciences (CAS).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "I chose the California Academy of Sciences because I knew they had mounted multiple major collecting expeditions to the Galapagos Islands more than a century ago," explained Dr Parker.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Of all the collections of old Galápagos birds that the researchers had found, CAS holds one of the most extensive collections in the world; 1170 of its specimens were collected between 1898 and 1899, and another 7401 were collected between 1905 and 1906. These birds were collected on islands that were inhabited by people and from others that were not.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After inspecting thousands of specimens for pox-like lesions, the researchers collected tiny samples from the lesions of 59 finches and mockingbirds and carefully examined them under the microscope (figure 2):
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Whilst some team members diagnosed poxvirus in the lesions based on their appearance under the microscope, others independently tested the samples for the presence of poxvirus DNA. When they compared their findings, the researchers found that all of the DNA-positive specimens (18/59) were also were positive for poxviruses based on their histopathology, but fewer than half of the pox-like lesions were confirmed to be caused by poxviruses using these methods (refer to figures 3 &amp; 4):
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                .
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dr Parker's team found that of the finch and mockingbird specimens sampled, those from islands inhabited by humans at the time of collection (Floreana, Isabela, San Cristóbal) were significantly more likely to be positive for <em>avipoxvirus</em> (20 of 35 specimens, or 57%) than those from islands not inhabited by humans (only 1 of 24 specimens, or 4.2%).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The numbers of birds testing positive for the virus mirrored the size of the human populations: islands with many people (San Cristóbal) had a high incidence of poxvirus infections, those with few people (Isabela and Floreana) had lower infection rates, whilst those islands with no human settlements (Española and Santa Cruz) had no infected birds.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "[B]y comparing the genetics of historic specimens in museum collections to those from today's wild populations, we can track the recent history of the population to answer questions about how changes to the land use patterns over time have affected the populations of wild plants and animals inhabiting that land," said Dr Parker.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Without museum collections, work like this would never be possible," said Jack Dumbacher, Curator of Ornithology at CAS. "Because museum specimens include detailed collection date and location data, they can be used to study not only a particular species, but also historical events and environmental conditions."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dr Parker's colleagues also found that the earliest canarypox-positive specimen was collected in 1899, indicating that just 64 years after Darwin made his historic visit to the Galápagos, <em>Avipoxvirus</em> had made its appearance in the endemic bird populations. However, the appearance of poxvirus might have occurred within an even narrower time period.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "[T]here was no hint of pox lesions even in the early 1890's," remarked Dr Dumbacher in email. "[A]nd there are a reasonable number of specimens available [for scientific studies]."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But how did the poxvirus get to the islands? DNA work shows that the poxvirus strain infecting wild birds in both the Galápagos and Hawai'i is different from those that infect domestic chickens. Further, it is unlikely that a biting insect carried it to the islands since the principal insect vectors, mosquitoes, only arrived in the Galápagos within the last 15 years. But the researchers cannot yet rule out the possibility that a migrating bird might have carried the virus with it, or that early settlers brought infected pet birds with them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "By looking at patterns of disease spread across islands, it is possible to identify the cause of the spread, and therefore identify the means by which to slow or prevent additional disease spreading," Dr Dumbacher said.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The spread of avian poxvirus has mirrored the establishment of human settlements -- and increasingly, the movement of tourists -- throughout the Galápagos Islands, indicating that humans are helping spread this disease.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "Now that we know that humans likely played a role in facilitating the spread of avian pox in the Galápagos, we'll be better equipped to develop policies designed to prevent further spread of the disease," said Dr Dumbacher.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Ecuadorian government has already taken steps to limit the damage. The Galápagos National Park was established in 1959, and is charged with protecting the islands and its natural resources. According to Dr Parker, as of 2007, all flights going to the Galápagos Islands are required to pass through the coastal town of Guayaquil, where they are fumigated. As of 2008, all passenger compartments are also fumigated whilst the airplane is on the runway prior to takeoff.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Other changes are likely in the works.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "I propose that they institute rather simple measures for avoiding tracking of the avipox virus from island to island with visitors," said Dr Parker. "Simple foot baths of bleach solution that visitors step into before stepping on the island they are visiting would be extremely helpful."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As it stands, the number of islands that can be visited on tours is severely restricted, and tour groups must be licensed and can only go to particular places on those islands, further minimizing problems.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But time is running out for the iconic birds of the Galápagos: avian malaria was detected recently in Galápagos penguins, further raising concerns. If the factors that led to extinction of Hawai'ian birds have been correctly deciphered, everything is now in place (avian poxvirus, mosquito vectors, and avian malaria) to cause the extinction of the Galápagos birds, too.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "[T]here is current knowledge and interest in preserving Galápagos species, so hopefully we can slow or prevent further damage," said Dr Dumbacher. "But even though Hawaii may have had a head start, Galápagos is following in its footsteps."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since people are spreading diseases that threaten native wildlife, should they stop visiting the Galápagos and other, similar, places?
