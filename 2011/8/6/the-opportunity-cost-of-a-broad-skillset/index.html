                            Very interesting balance to strike as a developer. Working as a web developer does help avoid this a bit simply because you had the natural option of learning essentially server-side and UI separately, which makes it easier to experiment with alternatives without completely jettisoning your existing knowledge about the rest of the environment.<br>
                            <br>
                            One other aspect which Rafe touched upon is the upgrade path: it's definitely a major challenge but I do wonder if much of the problem is legacy habit rather any particular challenge: many developers act like they're maintaining something like Windows or the Java standard library and are extremely reluctant to make major changes, even when the long-term cost for inertia is mounting and the actual cost of a gradual migration would be less than feared. This is particularly common in web apps which can easily be upgraded in-place but tend to be treated like legacy desktop software - particularly unnecessary when it's possible to start doing incremental upgrades because HTTP is such a flexible mechanism for interacting with disparate systems.

                                Tim Bray laments the feeling of productivity you get when you work with <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/08/05/Permanoob">tool set</a> that you’re intimately familiar with. He talks about constantly experimenting with the next great thing as part of his job, specifically the downside:

                                    But it means that I’ve been sort of a perpetual newbie. There’s another big piece of the software experience, one I haven’t shared in for years: where you’re concentrating on some problem and you know the codebase and tools, so your time goes more into doing and less into learning. In fact, that kind of work, in particular maintaining a large running production system, is where most of my professional colleagues spend most of their years of service.
                                </p>

                                That captures what I always liked least when I worked as a consultant. Moving from one project to the next, often on a different technology stack, meant never really feeling comfortable with what you’re working on.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On the other hand, working on maintaining a large, established system is often frustrating in its own way. You’re saddled with a code base that’s tough to change, with libraries that are often out of date, and with processes that aren’t cutting edge.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have a friend who has worked at the same small company for nearly 10 years, and they seem to rarely update anything that currently works. I describe his skill set as being trapped in amber. He is a complete master of the way Java applications were built ten years ago, but the industry has changed a lot in that time, and he’s missed out on benefitting from those changes because the company he works for is hidebound.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Keeping an existing application up to date is difficult. I’d love to see some statistics on how many applications that were built in Rails 1 have been upgraded to Rails 2 or Rails 3.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the end, this is one of the toughest parts of a software development career to manage. Walking the line between having the sorts of deep skills that enable you to be spectacularly productive and having a wide skill set that enables you to contribute in more situations is tough. Personally, I’ve always envied developers who are hyper-specialized. I know a guy who’s an expert on C compilers and always has a job with whatever company is trying to push gcc forward. If nothing else, he doesn’t have to sit around wondering whether he’s making a big mistake by not picking up Scala.
