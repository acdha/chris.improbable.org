                        <blockquote>
                            According to an official DOJ report, the use of "emergency", warrantless requests to ISPs for customer communications content has skyrocketed over 400% in a single year.<br>
                            <br>
                            <a href="http://files.spyingstats.com/exigent-requests/doj-2702-report-2010.pdf">The 2009 report</a> (pdf), which I recently obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request (it took DOJ <a href="http://files.spyingstats.com/exigent-requests/FOIA-reply-2010-2702-report.pdf">11 months</a> (pdf) to give me the two-page report), reveals that law enforcement agencies within the Department of Justice sought and obtained communications content for 91 accounts. This number is a significant increase over previous years: 17 accounts <a href="http://files.spyingstats.com/exigent-requests/doj-2702-report-2009.pdf">in 2008</a> (pdf), 9 accounts <a href="http://files.spyingstats.com/exigent-requests/doj-2702-report-2008.pdf">in 2007</a> (pdf), and 17 accounts <a href="http://files.spyingstats.com/exigent-requests/doj-2702-report-2007.pdf">in 2006</a> (pdf).<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Background</b><br>
                            <br>
                            When Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act in 1986, it permitted law enforcement agencies to obtain stored communications and customer records in emergencies without the need for a court order.<br>
                            <br>
                            In such scenarios, a carrier can (but is not required to) disclose the requested information if it, "in good faith, believes that an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure without delay of communications relating to the emergency." Typically, belief means that a police officer states that an emergency exists.<br>
                            <br>
                            With the passage of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, Congress created specific statistical reporting requirements for the voluntary disclosure of the contents of subscriber communications in emergency situations. In describing his motivation for introducing the requirement, Senator Lungren stated that:
                            <blockquote>
                                <br>
                                "I felt that some accountability is necessary to ensure that this authority is not being abused… This information [contained in the reports] I believe should be highly beneficial to the Committee, fulfilling our oversight responsibility in the future … this is the best way for us to have a ready manner of looking at this particular section. In the hearings that we had, I found no basis for claiming that there has been abuse of this section. I don't believe on its face it is an abusive section. But I do believe that it could be subject to abuse in the future and, therefore, this allows us as Members of Congress to have an ability to track this on a regular basis."
                            </blockquote><br>
                            <b>The current reports are deeply flawed</b><br>
                            <br>
                            The emergency request reports are compiled and submitted by the Attorney General, and only apply to disclosures made to law enforcement agencies within the Department of Justice. As such, there are no statistics for emergency disclosures made to other federal law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service, as well as those made to state and local law enforcement agencies.<br>
                            <br>
                            Furthermore, although 18 USC 2702 permits both the disclosure of the content of communications, as well as non-content records associated with subscribers and their communications (such as geo-location data), Congress only required that statistics be compiled for the disclosure of communications content. It is not clear why Congress limited the reports in this way.<br>
                            <br>
                            Because the reporting requirements do not apply to disclosures made to law enforcement agencies outside the Department of Justice, and do not include the disclosure of non-content communications data and other subscriber records, the reports reveal a very limited portion of the scale of voluntary disclosures to law enforcement agencies.<br>
                            <br>
                            Likewise, although Congress intended for these reports to assist with public oversight of the emergency disclosure authority, the Department of Justice has not proactively made these reports available to the general public. The reports for 2006 and 2007 were leaked to me by a friend with contacts on the Hill. I obtained the 2008 and 2009 reports via FOIA requests -- and disgracefully, it took DOJ 11 months to provide me with a copy of the 2-page report for 2009.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>The emergency requests documented in these reports only scratch the surface</b><br>
                            <br>
                            <a href="http://markey.house.gov/docs/telecomm/Verizon_wiretaping_response_101207.pdf">A letter</a> (pdf) submitted by Verizon to Congressional committees in 2007 revealed that the company had received 25,000 emergency requests during the previous year. Of these 25,000 emergency requests, just 300 requests were from federal law enforcement agencies. In contrast, the reports submitted to Congress by the Attorney General reveal less than 20 disclosures for that year. Even though no other service provider has disclosed similar numbers regarding emergency disclosures, it is quite clear that the Department of Justice statistics are not adequately reporting the scale of this form of surveillance. In fact, they underreport these disclosures by several orders of magnitude.<br>
                            <br>
                            The current reporting law is largely useless. It does not apply to state and local law enforcement agencies, who make tens of thousands of warrantless requests to ISPs each year. It does not apply to federal law enforcement agencies outside DOJ, such as the Secret Service. Finally, it does not apply to emergency disclosures of non-content information, such as geo-location data, subscriber information (such as name and address), or IP addresses used.<br>
                            <br>
                            As such, Congress currently has no idea how many warrantless requests are made to ISPs each year. How can it hope to make sane policy in this area, when it has no useful data?
