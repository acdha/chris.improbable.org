                                    Durham had long attracted attention in Indianapolis, and not just for his parties. He was also one of the state’s biggest backers of Republican politicians. “Tim Durham was somebody who came out of nowhere in the late ’90s and kind of declared himself a very rich guy,” says Greg Andrews, managing editor of the Indianapolis Business Journal, who has covered Durham extensively. “He established himself as a player by being a tremendously large donor to candidates.” Those included Governor Mitch Daniels. Durham gave $105,000 to his 2004 campaign, making Durham the governor’s second-biggest individual donor that cycle. Over the years, he made some $800,000 in political donations, according to public records. The perceived gap between Durham’s private behavior and his support for conservative candidates led Matthew Tully, a columnist for the Indianapolis Star, to chastise Durham for his conspicuously libertine lifestyle. The column went viral, likely because of its link to those Myspace photos.

                                    Durham was unfazed by the public admonishment. He kept throwing huge parties—though he set his Myspace page to private—and giving generously to the Indiana GOP. “That article ran about my R-rated Myspace page, and somehow I still get a lot of politicians wanting my money,” he told Indianapolis Monthly. “Apparently they didn’t see it. I’m going to give it to them as they come through the door now. ‘Didn’t you see this? I’m not someone you want to be associated with! I’m not a good influence!’ ” And he repeatedly boasted that Obsidian Enterprises, his leveraged buyout firm, had upped its profits massively in the last few years.
