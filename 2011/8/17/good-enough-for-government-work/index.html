                                So you just oversaw a disastrous government operation in which your agency passively stood by while illegal weapons were smuggled into Mexico, many of which were later later used in brutal murders carried out by drug cartels. What’s next for you?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Why, a promotion of course!
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    The ATF has promoted three key supervisors of a controversial sting operation that allowed firearms to be illegally trafficked across the U.S. border into Mexico.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    All three have been heavily criticized for pushing the program forward even as it became apparent that it was out of control. At least 2,000 guns were lost and many turned up at crime scenes in Mexico and two at the killing of a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Arizona.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The three supervisors have been given new management positions at the agency’s headquarters in Washington. They are William G. McMahon, who was the ATF’s deputy director of operations in the West, where the illegal trafficking program was focused, and William D. Newell and David Voth, both field supervisors who oversaw the program out of the agency’s Phoenix office . . .
                                </p>

                                And it gets better.
                            </p>

                                    McMahon was promoted Sunday to deputy assistant director of the ATF’s Office of Professional Responsibility and Security Operations — <strong><em>the division that investigates misconduct by employees and other problems.</em></strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Kenneth E. Melson, the ATF’s acting director, said in an agency-wide confidential email announcing the promotion that McMahon was among ATF employees being rewarded because of “the skills and abilities they have demonstrated throughout their careers.”
                                </p>

                                Emphasis mine.
                            </p>

                                It occurs to me that a promoted ATF agent is less likely than a fired ATF agent to be forthcoming about what higher-ups—political appointees, for example—knew about the operation, and how much and when they knew about it. But that would assume bad intent. Then again, the alternative is that these agents were promoted solely on merit, which really isn’t any less disturbing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
