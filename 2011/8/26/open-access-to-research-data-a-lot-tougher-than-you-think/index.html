                            <p>
                                Most Nobel Intent readers are familiar with the current effort to make research articles open access, but there is also a parallel effort to develop public&nbsp;archives for the&nbsp;research data behind them. We’ve addressed how <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/10/how-science-funding-is-putting-scientific-data-at-risk.ars">funding questions</a> make this a difficult issue, and the difficulty in <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/11/preserving-science-handling-raw-material.ars">preserving raw experimental material</a> (also limited by money), but the primary obstacle to widespread adoption of existing public research data repositories appears to be simply time and effort.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to commentary that recently appeared in <em>Nature Geoscience</em>, the time gap between the creation of data (such as experimental measurements) and the preservation (usually at publication) creates serious problems. It means that researchers need to deal with the formatting and deposition of data, an annoying step when they would rather be focusing on their next project. Given the time lag, it's also difficult to associate the correct metadata with the material that's being archived. The authors of the commentary propose developing a new workflow focused on data preservation from the very beginning, and suggest that research institutions should support scientists with data managers and local repositories.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Most agree that public access to research data is beneficial to all involved: publishers and funding agencies are interested in data accessibility and reusability, scientists gain from the use (and reference) of their work, and the public can feel more confident in scientific discoveries knowing that the supporting data is available. In fact, many funding groups have already made various forms of data sharing mandatory.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, while some specific repositories have been successful (think the&nbsp;<a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, which just celebrated its 20th birthday), many created over the past decade remain mostly empty. According to the commentary, scientists view data deposition as a burden due to the extra work it involves. Research data is usually not in the correct format for submission to repositories when the project is completed, and so the scientist must take the time to convert it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The authors here propose a new approach to data management, where each research institution should employ data managers to work with scientists and administer local, structured data storage. Local storage and support is the preference of most scientists, who would rather not hand off control of their data to remote strangers. When it comes time to deposit that data (at publication or the end of funding), the relevant data could easily be transferred to a different, public storage repository.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition, they suggest that the institutional data managers work with scientists from the beginning and store the entire data workflow, taking into account each step that alters the raw measurements (such as equations and processing algorithms). With this as a goal, workflow software can be created to automate the data creation process—not only will this help correctly structure data for archiving, but it will also help streamline the researchers’ analysis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a researcher, I can vouch for the importance of data sharing. This is particularly important for verifying discoveries, but in general, no one wants to reinvent the wheel—all progress is made standing on the shoulders of giants, after all. Currently, getting data from another lab usually only requires a phone call or e-mail to the lead author of a project, but there isn’t anything stopping competitors from ignoring such requests.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are other advantages. Public archives would ensure the data survives long after scientists’ hard drives fail. A validated, documented analysis pipeline could also make it much harder to falsify data.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The proposals discussed here are certainly interesting and could help the research community, but there are a couple issues. Primarily, institutional support for both data managers and repositories costs money—in the current economic times, this may be an insurmountable obstacle.&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, even with enough financial support, the scientists themselves may prevent an effort like this from succeeding. It's really difficult to alter the workflow of established scientists, and many may not appreciate deep involvement of an institutional data manager in their research. Funding agencies may force the research community to adopt public data sharing, but that community is likely to develop its own approaches to doing so.
