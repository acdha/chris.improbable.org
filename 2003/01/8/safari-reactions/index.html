                        <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> is <b>really</b> fast - OS X was always hindered by the lack of a fast, modern browser. Safari is faster than anything I've seen on OS X - it's perceptually as fast on my 400Mhz PowerBook as the 1.8GHz P4 next to it, which suggests that the bottleneck has shifted back to the network where it belongs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They've done a really nice job with the minimalist interface, too. Everyone's moaning about the lack of tabbed browsing but I have to agree with <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000793">Aaron</a> - I've tried a few implementations on various platforms and tabs have never felt natural.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tabbed browsing is really an attempt to hack around the fact that window creation is a heavyweight function on most operating systems, particularly OS X. Unfortunately, there's a stiff usability fee for this kludge as tabbed browsing breaks a number of UI rules:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Normally tabs are used for alternate views of the same data - browsing aggressively violates this.
                        </li>
                        <li>Tabs won't show up in window lists - if you turn off the display of the tab headers to save screen real-estate, there's no indication whatsoever that they exist. They also break some assumptions - (Control|Command)-W will close the current tab if there's more than one instead of closing the entire window like it normally would but a window's close button will still close the entire thing, neatly breaking years of user experience.
                        </li>
                        <li>The keyboard shortcuts are completely different. Chimera was particularly bad about this since you're substituting a one-hand two-key combination (Command-`) with a three key (Command-Shift-[) combination which requires two hands.
                        </li>
                        <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                            <p>
                                With Safari none of this really applies - opening a link in a new window takes Safari less time than opening the same link in a new tab takes Chimera. In fact the Safari interface is extremely faster than I had thought possible for an OS X app, which raises the question of whether there are any new performance tricks in recent 10.2 releases which the developers are using. It's obviously not a system-wide improvement as the rest of Apple's iApps and Mail are just as sluggish as always. Can things like the standard Cocoa toolbars really be that inefficient?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The single major feature keeping me glued to OmniWeb is the lack of an equivalent to OmniWeb's background bookmark checker - that's almost as useful as an RSS aggregator. I'm glad to see OmniGroup <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/mailman/archive/omniweb-l/2003-January/009160.html">with a constructive response</a> recognizing that the strength of OmniWeb has always been the interface, not the rendering engine itself - since Apple is opensourcing Safari's engine, the OmniGroup people should be able to spend their time on the useful interface enhancements instead of refighting the CSS compatibility battles.
